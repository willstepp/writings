THE DOGS OF SANTIAGO
by Daniel Stepp

I.

One

As he stepped off the plane onto the walkway between the exit door and the terminal gate he felt a bitterly cold July wind whip in through one of the slits in the fabric joins. He weaved through the passengers, stumbling and bleary-eyed, and made his way to the nearest restroom, where he found some jeans and an old flannel shirt he kept tucked in the side pouch of his duffle, just in case. A fat man, Chilean, emerged from the last stall and was surprised to see a half-naked American standing there, but made no eye contact and walked straight out with a frown. The man pulled up his jeans and washed his face in the dirty sink. He caught himself in the mirror. The dim neon lights shadowed his face with older and more tired lines. He never could sleep on a plane, or a bus, or any other place for that matter. Not without pills anyway. And he wanted to conserve them for when it got bad again.

"Muchas gracias, señor," he greeted his reflection in the mirror.

"De nada."

From the gates to customs was a cavernous hallway with brick-lined walls. It looked old, a modern architecture from thirty years ago. Everything was bathed in a neon half-light. Above were skylights, but outside it was still early morning, dark, yet the the sky lightening against the dark clouds. The floors shined. You could see fifty yards ahead. Down there, close to a row of doors was a janitor, slowly mopping. The man kept pace with the others, most sleepwalking without really knowing where they were headed. There were signs in Spanish, and arrows. He had downloaded a translator app before leaving, but did not feel the need to pull it out just now. There seemed only one way to go.

Remembering what he had read about long flights he moved his legs and ankles more than necessary as he walked, kicking up his heels ever so often. Get the blood flowing. He had not had much of a chance on the plane stretch his legs or get up and walk around, since he was on a window seat and there were others blocking him. He had a real fear of pulmonary embolism. You could be fine for a day, after a fourteen hour flight. Then suddenly you collapse as the clot that formed the day before as blood gathered in your ankles reaches your lungs. Maybe you are having dinner with business partners. Maybe you are dancing with a pretty girl you met that day. And now you were dead. It gave him chills, and he knew he could not fully let it go until maybe tomorrow, or the day after. He would keep thinking about it and wondering in the back of his mind, will I die now? He braced himself against the corridor wall and gave both legs a good stretch. Then kept walking.

Finally his group reached a vast room. It came suddenly, around a bend, and everyone woke up a little more. There were more signs and arrows, but they were not necessary because in the middle of the space was a line of people, winding through dividers. It was maybe hundreds. His heart sank. He felt the old dizziness come over him; the old pounding in the chest. He considered taking a Xanax and being done with it, but decided to wait. He took in a few deep breaths and followed the others to where the line ended.

If he focused on the breathing it wasn't so bad and after a few minutes he couldn't feel his heart pounding anymore, didn't feel dizzy. He felt composed and took in his surroundings. The line was moving fast. At this rate he would be through in another thirty minutes, not bad considering the volume of people. Behind  him now was a line of at least fifty people. This place was odd. It felt makeshift, although there were permanent kiosks set up at the end. All around them were closed stores. He saw a few signs in English, "Duty free!" and "Last chance!" He saw things he recognized which he found strange. A bag of Hershey's Kisses, a Harper's Bazaar magazine, the same stuffed bear he saw at Hartsfield Jackson.

In front of him was a balding man. He was with an attractive woman, blond, shapely. He wondered where they were from and thought about asking them, but decided it would be too awkward to keep up the conversation, too much trouble as he really didn't want to talk to anybody.

"Excuse me," he tapped the blonde on the shoulder.

"What do you need?" said the man. He put himself between the girl and the man and looked down. His accent was German, perhaps Scandinavian.

"What time is it?"

The German pointed to a clock on the wall overhead and turned back around. He stared at his bald head and thought of his own thinning crown. One day his hair would be as bald as this guy's, for sure. The only difference was he would look ridiculous, and this guy wore it well. He wondered if the girl had been with him before he was bald, or after. If only you could ask those kinds of questions. Scanning the rest of the crowd it will clear there were people from all over. By far the majority looked South American, but there were a lot of Europeans. Some Americans maybe, maybe Canadian. He kept his eye on an attractive woman a few bends ahead. Ever so often they would cross paths and he would briefly make eye contact. He smiled at her but she did not smile back.

At last he reached the end of the line where there was a small digital sign with red numbers, indicating which kiosk the next person in line should go to. His number flashed fifteen and he walked down to the end, where a customs officer in a dark gray uniform nodded to him. The officer seemed irritated and held out his hand. The man suddenly panicked when he realized he needed the customs paperwork he had filled out on the plane, as well as identification. He was not focused. He took in a deep breath and reached in his pocket but the papers were not there. He reached down for his duffle but the duffle was not there.

The officer said something to him in Spanish, made a gesture with his hand as if he was holding a card.

"I'm sorry," the man said, "do you speak English? I don't know Spanish. My bag is gone. Can I go get it? I need to go find it."

The officer shook his head and leaned back in his chair, looking over to a few kiosks down. He whistled and said someone's name. Another officer came over and spoke to him.

"Sir, where is your id and entry paperworks?"

"That's what I was saying, they're all in my duffle bag and I seemed to have misplaced it somewhere. Maybe on the plane. Can I go get it and return?"

"Sir, we need your identification."

"I know, I'll be right back. Sorry."

He retraced his path through the dividers, past what was by this point hundreds of people. His eyes were fixed on the ground, looking back and forth for his duffle bag. As he went his pace quicker and quickened until he was almost jogging. A young girl in a pink winter coat caught his eye and pointed at him. No sign of the back.

Once past the line of people he broke into a sprint into the corridor leading back to the gates. His heart beat loud in his chest. What would happen if he couldn't find his duffle. All his identification was in there. How could he have left it? Why didn't he pay more attention? He had fucked it all up already. It hadn't even begun and it was fucked up. As his panic increased so did he pace and by that point he was running down the corridor. On the right and left he passed people of all colors, shapes, and sizes, but could not take them in or even acknowledge their amazed looks. A loud whistle echoed from the far end of the corridor. He stopped and glanced back.

A guard with one hand on his mouth and the other on some kind of club gestured violently for him to slow down. The man nodded so the guard could see and resumed walking at a brisk pace.

Eventually he returned to the gates, saw the large numbers and the planes outside. As he passed the bathrooms he remembered going in there and stopped to look. Now there were lots of people but his bag was not there. He looked underneath the stalls and at the very end, he saw the familiar black leather strap dangling down. He went over to the stall and opened the door.

In the stall was a kid, fifteen maybe, sifting through his bag. On the toilet paper rack he could see his checkbook, car keys, and earbuds. The kid was skinny, probably Chilean. Without thinking Will man grabbed him by the shirt, ripping it at the collar. He growled,

"What the fuck? That's my stuff! That's my bag you're going through!"

The kid stammered something in Spanish and tried to break free. The man was about to let him go, but a wave of anger went through him and he shoved him hard into the toilet. The kid's back hit the side of the tank and he went down, grabbing himself with both hands. The man was immediately sorry but his anger was still high. He lunged at the kid and the kid scrambled under the stall opening and ran out.

Dizziness overcame him and he sat on the toilet and put his head in his hands. After a few minutes he collected himself and put his things back into the bag. He made sure his ID and paperwork was still there, and then took an itinerary of everything else he could remember bringing. It was all there. He took out his toiletries bag and unzipped it, popping two pills from an orange prescription bottle. He placed them on his tongue and went out to the sink. He turned on the faucet and cupped a handful of water into his mouth, swallowing the pills.

Then he returned to the stall and waited. It took half and hour or so for the Xanax to kick in, and when it did he felt the fear and dizziness subside. A heavy sense of peace and mellowness came over him. He could sleep here if he wanted, but got up and made his way back to customs. He was laughing about everything that happened and didn't even mind waiting in line for the other hour it took.

"Here, the paperwork and my ID," he handed his documents to another kiosk officer. This officer also did not speak much english. The officer nodded and wrote something down on the paper. He stamped his passport and gave it back to him, waving him through to the other side.

This place is like a maze, he thought, rounding another corner, not sure exactly where he was going, but following the general traffic of people. He smelled food somewhere, coffee, sausage, cinnamon rolls. He next entered a cavernous space, with high ceilings, baggage claim conveyers. A female voice came over the speakers in regular intervals spoke something in Spanish, in a calm voice. He found his flight number on the digital panels overhead and walked over to find his checked bag in a stack against the far wall. He wheeled it out and continued through the area, the space congested with crowds of families and businesspeople, couples and patrolling guards with guns in their holsters. He came to the back of a disorganized line, the end of which ended in a panicked crowd of travelers shoving their checked baggage through X-ray machines as officers inspected their contents on tiny monitors to the side.

A Frenchmen pushed into line ahead of him, subtly, using his cell phone conversation as a distraction. The man did not argue. He was not upset, the drugs at maximum effectiveness now. He was relaxed. He even felt proud of himself for not saying anything or reacting in outrage, although he might have only thirty minutes ago. Good stuff, he thought. Someday I have to quit.

As they approached the X-ray machines, a large German Shephard came nosing through the crowd, leading an officer by his leash. The dog sniffed at bags every now and then, sometimes stopping, but most of the time he continued without breaking a stride. When he reached the man's luggage he stopped and sniffed around for a few seconds and the man's gut dropped. Were his prescriptions legal to bring into the country? He really didn't know. Would they confiscate them, arrest him. So many fears went through his mind until the dog continued on his way. The man made eye contact with the dog's officer, who seemed preoccupied and did not return his nod.

He put his bag through the X-ray machine when it was time, and the rubber belt pulled it through the metal box. He watched it go through on the monitor and saw all his belongings in what looked like camera film negative. There was a green outline around the monitor screen, which he took as a good sign, until the officer who sat at the monitor pushed a button to stop the conveyor. A buzzer sounded and a few other officers looked around to see what was happening.

One came over and the other pointed out something to him. They both nodded and looked suspiciously at the man. Even with the sedatives in his system he was panicked and wondered what they had found. The other officer walked to the conveyor and pulled out his luggage. He unzipped it there in front of everyone, exposing his underwear, bag of q-tips, everything. He pushed everything to the side until he found an apple and a box of Cheez-Its. He pulled them out and tossed them into the trash. He then zipped up the luggage and gave the man an impatient glance, pointing to a sign which illustrated no food or produce. He gave a nod to the officer at the monitor who hit another button and the conveyor continued, this time without stopping. He was through.

He rode an escalator up to the main level into the general area of the airport. At the top he went through a crowd of expectant faces, each looking for some other face than his. The smell of food was stronger here and he had not eaten since the night before, so he decided to stop and grab something to eat before heading to the hotel. He found a coffee shop among a row of restaurants and stood in line there, pointing to a cherry danish in the glass and somehow communicating to the girl behind the counter he wanted a medium-sized mocha. He reached the counter and a man gave him the total in Spanish.

"Just take it out of this," he said, handing him the twenty from his wallet.

"No moneda Americano," the man said. He seemed agitated.

"No?"

"No," the man behind the counter repeated, and pointed down the walkway, making a gesture like exchange of money.

"Oh fuck, sorry man," the man said. He took back the twenty and pushed the coffee and danish back into the counter.

The exchange didn't open for another half hour, so the man sat on his bag against the desk. He was exhausted, hungry, and just wanted to get to the hotel so he could get some proper sleep before this afternoon. He took out his phone and checked to see if there was a signal (there wasn't) and then finished listening to a WTF with Marc Maron podcast he had started on the flight. Then he realized his battery was low so turned it off. As he sat there he remembered all his last-minute travel notes were written on the phone's notepad app. So he pulled his journal and pen from his duffle, turned back on the phone, and copied them down, just in case.

By then the exchange was opened, and he exchanged the rest of his pocket money, about a hundred and twenty dollars, for Chilean pesos. He looked at the strange, brightly colored money for a moment before stuffing it in his wallet. He returned to the coffee shop but there was a line so he said screw it and decided to head to the hotel instead.

Outside it was even colder than he remembered from this morning, overcast and windy. An old man was spraying down the walkway outside the automatic doors and some overspray him in the face. He gave the old man a nasty look and went down a ways to a line of yellow taxis, all the drivers leaned on their vehicles, waiting for customers.

"Hey man, need a lift?" one of the driver's said. He was the only one who spoke English so he gave him a nod and handed him his luggage. The driver jumped up, threw the luggage in the trunk and opened the door for the man. Once inside he asked, "Where would you like to go?" with such a strong accent and trouble articulating the words it was obvious he only knew enough English for business reasons. But it was enough.

"180 Miraflores, cross street with Moneda. Here," he handed him the notes he had jotted into his journal earlier, and pointed to the address.

"Ah, Hotel Riveria, si" The driver gave him a thumbs up, put down the fare flag, and took off.

Once far enough away, the man turned back and took in the entire airport. It was an impressive sight, the giant metal and glass structure, futuristic in that thirty year old way.

The driver weaved in and out of the traffic like a man on a mission. He made no attempt at small talk, but this was fine with him. It would have been impossible anyway. So instead, he looked out the window, a wave of relief coming over him. 

He had a moment of weakness back there, he had actually taken some Xanax. It had been a couple months since the last time. He knew it would be this way. And it was. He felt good. Thankfully he had done as his mother suggested and got the prescription filled the day he told her he was leaving. Just the Xanax and Ambien, short term stuff. No Lexapro, he didn't need a long-term solution, just a safety net. Fuck, why did he shove that poor kid? That kid probably had shit his pants. Hell, he nearly shit his. That was not him back there. Not him at all.

He saw outside the cars going by. Cars he did not recognize, smaller and older than those on the American highways. Inside were Chileans. Life here was the same as in the states. Going to work, going home. The buildings were the same, not exactly, but close enough. Old ones, shiny new ones. Dilapidated ones. Graffiti on the concrete overpass. In Spanish of course. Green signs in Spanish, roads, exits. The smells the same, gasoline, the crisp, almost metallic winter air. A gray light, overcast, maybe a little chance of rain. The people different, native, more ancient looking, shorter. He saw them walking on the sidewalks. 

Beyond the city he saw the mountains, the Andes. How far was it there, to those snowy peaks? He imagined the silence of that place in contrast to the noise down here. He was sitting there in the snow, cross-legged, he ankles exposed and freezing. The cold of the snow slowly coming through the bottom of his jeans. He shivered. The only sound here was the whipping of the wind around the crags. No life nor food. Only silence. No place for a human being.

He awoke still in the taxi, the driver stopped in construction traffic, frustrated and banging on the steering wheel. It was raining. Outside were people walking past, making better time than the cars. It took him a few moments to realize he was in Chile, took some time before the events of the morning came back to him. He reached into his duffle bag and pulled out his journal. Between two pages was a folded photograph. He opened it and gazed at the dark-haired woman staring back at him. She was beautiful.


Two

Curled up inside the doorway to the Hotel Riviera, a gray mutt of some kind lay oblivious to the world, preventing the old doors from opening fully. The man was soaked through by this point and had his duffle stacked on top of his luggage, which was being wheeled behind him. A stream of water fell down over the green fabric overhang of the entrance onto his bag. The man pushed hard against the door and slid the dog out of the way with it. He then twirled his luggage around and pushed them through the door first, holding the door with one hand.

Inside, the foyer was cramped with archways separating the different areas. Its decor was out of fashion by a few decades, wooden accents, paintings of ships and European beaches, dim lighting everywhere. The tiled floors were slick with rain, so the man went carefully over to the front desk. A couple was ahead of him, speaking to the hotel clerk. They argued in Spanish, and then the male customer finally threw his hands up and signed a sheet of paper. When he turned around to leave he made eye contact with the man, and rolled his eyes. The man nodded. When he approached the desk he pulled out a sheet of paper, where he had translated what he needed to tell the clerk.

"Hola, mi nombre es William S y tengo una habitación reservada para esta noche hasta el miércoles," he read with emphasis on each word.

"Reservation you say?"

"Yes, good, you speak English. I didn't know."

The clerk nodded, "Si. Let me find your reservation."

He flipped through a small notepad on the counter.

"Mr. S?"

"Yes, that's me." the man smiled.

"We have no Mr. S with reservation. Did you mean Sloan? We have a Sloan."

"No, you should have a reservation. I wrote an email just yesterday. In Spanish. Said I was coming into the city today. Mr. S, staying through Wednesday. I received a response from a lady. I printed it out. Here."

He handed the clerk the printout. The clerk took it, read thoughtfully, and turned to a lady on the other side of the desk. They talked for some time, flipping through more papers, and finally the clerk turned back to him.

"Mr. S, we have no copy of your reservation but would be happy to rent you a room. Would you like a room?"

"Please," the man said, and then added, "at the rate you quoted in the email, $75 a night?"

The clerk frowned.

"Unfortunately, sir, we do not have any more rooms at that rate. We have a double bed room for $120 American dollars a night, is that okay?"

"Fine, that's fine."

A young boy took his luggage and walked him over to a small elevator in the back corner hallway. He put down the bags and pushed the only button. "Cinco," he said, and then wandered off. The man looked at his key, the number 512 in gold letters. Eventually a rickety platform came down and stopped. The man slid open the wooden door and wheeled his luggage into the space. He pressed the 5 button and the lift shuttered and squeaked then took him up.

The room was clean and small. It had two twin beds with a tiny shelf between them. A clock radio on the shelf blinked 12:32 am. He turned on his phone and checked the time, 11:18 am. The battery was on red so he pulled out the plug and discovered the outlets were different. "One more fucking thing," he said, turning off the phone. He set the time on the clock radio and set the alarm for 3 pm. Then he pulled back the thin sheets and blanket and curled up in them, kicking off his shoes onto the floor.

The alarm woke him at 3 and he rose and immediately opened his laptop. It still had an hour or so. He found the wifi and connected, no password required. He opened his email and reread the last email from Constanza:

	Hey! Glad you decided to come! You so crazy (in a good way ;-) 	I know you won't have phone when you get here, but maybe send 		an email from the hotel? If I don't hear from you let's just 		meet up at Juan Valdez in Providencia at 1730. Can't wait to 		meet you in person finally, so we can have one of our deep 			conversations face to face. C

	PS - I'm super nervous! xoxoxo

He replied:

	The eagle has landed! In Chile as we speak (write). I told you 	I would make it happen. This is just to let you know I'm here 		and can make it to Juan Valdez by 1730 no problem. I will see 		you there, D

	PS - I'm nervous too! @-->---

He undressed, grabbed his toiletries bag, his travel towel, and went to the bathroom. As he flipped the light switch a loud flash popped and the bathroom went dark. He fumbled around for the shower and eventually figured out a medium temperature. He got in the shower and bathed in the dim light that came in from outside. After, he pulled out his nice jeans and a dark striped button up, white t-shirt, his nice leather shoes. Fortunately there was a mirror in his toiletries bag, so he used that to floss his teeth and fix his hair.

Downstairs he approached the same clerk who checked him in and asked if he knew any stores that sold US socket adapters and also a place that sold flowers. The clerk nodded and walked around the desk. He led the man outside, where it had stopped raining. He took him by the hand and led him to the curb, traffic bumper to bumper. He pointed down to the end of Miraflores.

"See, there the intersection, look for Merced. There is a Lider. In there you can buy some flowers. For adapters, maybe head down Moneda to the market side streets. Good?"

Will nodded, but then asked, "Well, if down Moneda has a marketplace, do I need to go to the Lider? It might save me walking if I can get both in the same place."

"Do what you like, my friend. I think you will be okay," the clerk said, somewhat agitated. I need to get back to the desk."

He walked back to the hotel, but tripped over an elderly man sitting against the building. The man had only one leg, but it was extended into the walkway. He held out a styrofoam cup with a few coins in it. The clerk lost his temper and cursed at the old man, who just stared at his insults. Eventually the clerk went back into the hotel. Will felt sorry for the crippled man, and wanted to help him, but felt ashamed. He didn't know why.

Will decided to try his luck down Moneda, so took off that way, making sure he noted the direction he came from so he could find his way back. There were crowds of people, businessmen mostly, attractive women. Traffic everywhere. He passed a large church next to a large government building. He noticed certain intersections were only for pedestrian traffic, and they even had red lights and green lights. He turned down one of these side streets, Ahumeda and found a small electronics store. Luckily he had remembered to bring his plug and just showed it to the man behind the counter. The man went to the back and returned with a black adapter and that was that. Will handed him the largest Chilean bill he had and that seemed to cover it, with change back. He continued down the street, looking for a place that might sell flowers. He also glanced around for a clock but couldn't find one, so he stopped a lady going the opposite direction and tapped his wrist as if asking for the time.

"Las cuatro y media," she replied.

"English?"

"No," she shook her head and then went on.

He walked down the street, passing store after store, hundreds of people. His breathing shallower and shallower, until he had to stop and collect himself against a large movie advertisement, Cars 2. He breathed deep and slowly the dizziness passed. His heart rate returned to normal.

At last he came to another Lider, the same store the hotel clerk had mentioned, and walked in. Like most grocery stores, it had a familiar layout. But he couldn't find any section with flowers. He approached a worker stocking pizza crusts and spoke to him in English.

"Hey, can you help me find flowers? I'm in kind of a hurry."

"Que?" the man asked.

"Flowers, pretty flowers."

"Engles?"

"Si, English. Can you show me to the flowers, if you have any?"

"Si," the man said. He rose and led him over two isles to the baked goods. There the worker pointed to five and ten pound bags of flour.

"Flour" he said.

"Si," Will said, "Gracias. Gracias"

The worker smiled and walked off.

Will continued walking the isles until finally he spotted a little stand with some potted plants and flowers. He picked out bunch of red and yellow flowers in a pot, bought the entire pot and tossed it and the soil outside the store. 

He carried the flowers in one hand and the bag with the adapters in the other and decided to try to reach Providencia by Metro. He pulled out the small guide book the hotel provided and found the Metro map. The nearest station was Santa Lucia, back in the direction of Hotel Riviera. He quickened his pace and using the map, found his way back to Moneda, then up to the Santa Lucia metro entrance.

It was not too much trouble to get the metro pass, a plastic card with BIP! written in bold yellow letters. He loaded the card up with ten thousand pesos, scanned it at the gate and descended to the platform with a red sign that listed all the stops in the western direction: Universidad Catolica, Baquedano,  Salvador, Manuel Montt, Pedro De Valdivia, and Los Leones, the stop he wanted, according to the map. After a few minutes the silver train rumbled to a stop in front of him and dozens of passengers exited, while dozens more tried to get on. He squeezed on just before the doors pulled shut and a female voice came on the intercom. He stood in a pack of people, most looking at their cell phones. The train pulled away from the platform and Will watched the people outside go by in an increasing blur. Then the tunnel. Fifteen minutes later he was in Los Leones.

He followed the other passengers up the stairs around the bend to one of the exits, there were signs but he wasn't sure if it was the right one. He passed a small bakery inside and the aroma of fresh bread reminded him he hadn't eaten since he arrived earlier this morning. He went up the steps to the street and took out the street map the hotel had provided. He had marked the location of the Juan Valdez on it, and the Los Leones metro. The problem was there appeared to be two exits to the station and he couldn't easily tell which he had emerged from. He walked around the crowds to the street signs and traced them on the map, but the street he was on wasn't on the map. Finally he got frustrated and stopped a man in a suit.

"Hola, donde es Juan Valdez?" he asked, surprised he had remembered enough to articulate a complete thought in Spanish.

The man pointed behind him and said something Will did not comprehend, but that was at least something to go on.

"Si, si. Gracias!"

"De nada."

Will continued down the way the man had told him, still unsure where he was. He stopped to ask another passerby what time it was. 1645. Good. He still had plenty of time. Even so, with the crowds of people and the traffic and the stress of finding the place, he could feel the dizziness and disconnected feeling coming on. He took in a few breaths and told himself to calm down, but it didn't do much good. It was too early to take another Xanax, he had already broke his rule and taken two at the airport this morning. Better to suffer through this, but maybe he would take one before Constanza arrived, to get back in the zone.

The streets around him were shadowed by the looming office buildings and upper class department stores. Most were unfamiliar but he recognized a few, Perry Ellis, Armani. The sun was dropping below the skyline, and every so often it would appear between the cracks and briefly blind the crowd, their hands held up to their eyes in unison. He passed restaurants and cafes. The food smelled fresh and good. Maybe he would take Constanza out for a nice dinner. In the rush he hadn't even thought of what they could do. He only thought about seeing her in person. Coffee, dinner, a walk in the park. Maybe the one close to the Hotel Rivieria he had seen. A smile came over his face. It was good to be here, he thought. A bold move for sure.

A few more turns and directions from passersby later he arrived at an open square, with italian restaurant tucked in the back corner and to the right the Juan Valdez coffee shop. He went inside and asked the barista what time it was, 1700. Good. He looked in the glass display and pointed to a bright red fruit drink and also grabbed a croissant	 with butter. He found a comfortable spot upstairs with a good view of the entrance so he wouldn't miss Constanza arriving. He popped a Xanax and drank it down the fruit drink. The drink was way too sweet, like syrup. He winced and walked down to the bar and asked for agua. They gave him a premium bottled water and he couldn't figure out how to ask for tap water, so he paid for it and returned upstairs.

Juan Valdez was nice enough, a chain obviously, comparable to Starbucks in the States, although he had seen a few of those along the way too. Will wasn't much of a coffee drinker but the croissant was good, warm, freshly made. The patrons seemed like college students, upper class businessmen and women meeting after work. A girl close to him was typing into a Macbook and listening to something poppy in her headphones, he could almost hear the tune.

Fifteen minutes later he could feel the Xanax take effect, something like sinking into a warm mud bath. He closed his eyes and listened to the Spanish rock music they had playing over the speakers. Today it was okay to take the Xanax, but today only. Last minute travel to foreign country to see a woman he had never met certainly qualified as a stressor, if anything did. He  scanned the downstairs one time to make sure she had not yet arrived. They should have arranged a signal of some kind, like a flower on her shirt or something. Knowing someone from a photo is quite a different thing from recognizing them in person. He had been on enough online dates to know that. But he was sure it wouldn't be too hard to spot Constanza. Her picture was honest. Good lighting, a square angle.

He asked the girl next to him what time it was, 1745. He walked downstairs and scanned the floor, but did not see her. Just then a girl walked through the entrance he thought was her, but it wasn't. He must have been staring too intently at the customers as they all seemed to stop what they were doing and stare back at him. He pretended he was checking his phone (although it was turned off) and walked outside to look around. By now the streets were bathed in twilight, the lights from the storefronts still open giving off a glow. There were only a few tables outside and she was not here either. He went back inside, upstairs and waited.

Half an hour later, Will was wondering if he should try to find a computer, or head back to the hotel to check his email there. It was dark outside. He walked down to the barista and asked the time, 1840. Even with the sedative in his system he was anxious. He didn't want to blow this meetup. It was almost perfect, if she'd just get here already. He pulled the photograph from his pocket and showed it to the barista, then gestured to the cafe. The barista leaned in to get a good look at the photo and then looked up at Will, smiling. Will again swept the room with a gesture as if asking if he had seen her there. The barista slowly grinned and shook his head. He said something, a name, that Will did not recognize.

"Constanza," he said, pointing to the photograph.

The barista laughed, "Ana Tijoux, si!" He whistled at his coworkers down the line - they walked over. He asked Will for the photo, showed them, then started acting like he was singing into a microphone. One of the girls looked up at Will and giggled. "Ana Tijoux," they repeated to each other and laughed.

"Who's Ana Tijoux, are you saying that's the girl in the picture? What are you saying?"

The baristas looked at him and then a younger guy ran in back and brought back a tablet, punched in a few keys and handed it to Will. There, unmistakable, was Constanza, rapping in a YouTube video. It had a few million views. "Ana Tijoux, love her" read the top comment. Will typed Ana Tijoux in the search box and switched to the images tab. There he saw dozens of photos of Ana Tijoux, Chilean pop artist with French ancestry. Lots of the photos were slick and glossy with obvious retouches, but there were a few candid ones, her looking like a normal girl, and towards the bottom of the screen he saw his own photo of Ana, Constanza. His heart sank.

Will handed back the tablet to the barista and walked out into the street. The crowds had thinned and the square was silent for the moment, a distant honking. He walked in the direction he thought his hotel was in but did not consult the map. Before he realized it he was looking at the Pedro De Valdivia metro entrance but passed it by. He felt like he needed to breath in the cool evening air and couldn't conceive of going down where he had no air to breathe. He passed more restaurants but was no longer hungry. A sick, hollow feeling in his stomach replaced the hunger. A few dogs in a pack hurried past as if they were headed somewhere important, then turned a corner onto a side street. Will followed them just to have something outside his own thoughts to focus on. The lead dog was larger than the rest and wore a tattered vest of some kind. It looked warm.

He followed them down the avenue, past another metro entrance, to a cross street, where a few pedestrians were waiting on the light to change. The dogs paused here, wise enough to know not to cross the street if the people weren't crossing. Will watched them. When the crosswalk light turned white the pedestrians started walking and the dogs continued. Will continued.

At last it was obvious to him they were working, those dogs. He watched them pass a bodega or cafe and stop momentarily at each door, especially if there was a couple eating an an outside table, or a clerk sweeping the front steps, hoping to get some scraps, and a few times they did. It was touching to see.

Now the lights of the city were brighter than the evening sky, which now appeared as deep blue clouds when you looked over the building tops down the avenue. The dogs came to a restaurant called the Hotel California, where the smell of grilled meat and the sound of clinking mugs of beer and loud music swirled through the street outside. The dogs ducked into a small space between the restaurant and disappeared. Will stopped at the entrance and looked inside. There was a game on the big screen TV and people laughing and smoking at the bar. Upstairs he saw a couple cuddling against the window. He went inside.


Three

When he turned from the television he noticed the bartender had slid the cheeseburger and fries in front of him. All around him the patrons were having a good time. When the beer came, he drank it down quick, with a Xanax, and then just waited for the numbness to take hold. By the time the burger came he was barely conscious of wolfing it down. It surprised him to see the clean plate in front of him. He let out a deep belch and and held the empty mug up to the bartender. The bartender nodded and filled his mug. He thought about ordering another burger, just for the hell of it, but decided to drink the calories instead. He felt the numbness come over him and forgot about Constanza, the reason he came down to this Godforsaken country in the first place.

By the middle of the second round he had begun watching the game with the other patrons. It was a soccer game, between who he couldn't say, but one of them had to be Chile based on the reactions. Each time one team made a goal the entire place shouted in unison. Their energy was infectious. Before long Will was shouting along with them. He even gave out a few high fives as the heaviness of the sedative took effect and made everything better. He grinned at nothing and thought about nothing except what was in front of him. A bowl of nuts. He ate a couple. He was suddenly filled with an excitement and a sense of belonging he had not felt since arriving here. Probably it was the alcohol, or the drugs, but it was better than the alternative, so he enjoyed it while it lasted.

At some point he felt the presence of someone over his shoulder. It was a man, leaning far over the bar, waving to the bartender.

"No, no man, he won't respond to that shit," Will said, "You gotta do it like this."

Will took the last swig from the mug and slammed it down to the inside edge of the bar. The bartender looked up, made eye contact with Will, who waved him over. When the bartender came over, he gestured to the man, who smiled.

"Quattro tequila shots, señor. Got Patrõn?"

"Si, quattro Patrõn?"

"Yes indeed, señor bartender."

Will looked up at the man for the first time. He was tall, shoulder-length brown hair, clearly from the States.

"Wait," Will stammered, "Are you American?"

"Ben," the man held out his hand, "we have a party going on in the back, bunch of expats, if you care to join?"

Will shook his hand, and when the shots came up Ben asked for one more and then he and Will walked back through the restaurant. As he arose the room spun a little and Will held onto the bar to steady himself. Each room they went through was painted a different bright color, yellow, blue, then red. Patrons were sitting at tables throughout, eating massive amounts of USA-inspired cuisine. Burgers, steaks, chicken wings.  Even after his own burger, Will was still famished. He had decided against a full meal on the flight down. Ben rounded the corner next to the bathrooms and they entered an open space with plants, bench seats and a dart board on the end.

Ben walked over to a small group next to the dartboard. They all looked up hazily, as if they had been well drunk for some time.

"Fulbrights. Will," Ben introduced, setting the tray of drinks down on a small table between them, "Will. the Fulbrights of Chile in all their majesty."

"Are you guys related then?"

"In what sense?" a nerdy fellow at the dartboard asked. He pulled all the darts from the board and walked back to the taped line a few feet away.

Ben said, "Have you never heard of the Fulbright Scholarship Program?"

Ben distributed the shots among the group, who seemed to come alive at the prospect of another round of shots. He handed Will a shot last. They nodded to one another and downed the drinks. Will's head spun as he slung his head back. He followed the tequila with a slice of lemon and smacked his lips. Everyone gave an approving shout.

"Oh, I think I have heard of it. Wasn't Bill Clinton a Fulbright Scholar? What do you do?"

An attractive girl with long hair approached him and held out her hand.

"Nice to meet you. I'm Janette," she said, "Fulbright is an international exchange program for students, you apply for it with an idea of somewhere you'd like to visit to do research, and if they like your idea they give you money to go do it, basically. It's not that big of a deal."

"No," Ben laughed, "It's totally a big deal. We're really fucking smart and you probably couldn't get in if you tried."

"Whatever," Janette punched him in the arm.

"So you met me, and that is Jamie over there with the glasses, and that's Robert in the corner, but we call him the Silent One."

Will waved to Jamie, who saluted and threw another dart. He looked over to the corner and saw a young guy in a dark coat leaning back in a lounge chair with his eyes shut.

"The silent one?" Will asked, "Does he not talk?"

Jamie walked over and held out his hand. "He doesn't talk actually. He has taken a vow of silence for a year, in person, online, everywhere. None of these guys actually knows what he sounds like. I do though."

"I bet he sounds like Barry White," Janette laughed and sat down again.

"I'll never tell," Jamie said.

"Interesting."

"It's not as pretentious as it sounds," Jamie said, "I mean, it's pretentious, but its not utter bullshit. Robert is more of an artist than the rest of us. The rest of us are scientists."

"So the vow is an art project?"

"Kind of. The vow is certainly part of it, but the most interesting part is the social media aspect. Are you at all interested in this? Cause I can stop."

"No," Will said, "I'm interested."

"Well," Jamie began, as if he was used to explaining it, "So first of all, you have to understand the conception of it all. The thesis I suppose. And the thesis is this: The number one of plague of our time is the proliferation of mass communication. This is a new phenomena in history, up to now lack of information has always been the problem. Now our problem is so much information that it becomes chaos, noise, distraction. And so, since the responsibility of the artist in a society is to intuit its problems and manifest the appropriate response, Robert has consciously created a new artistic movement."

Jamie paused for effect. 

Ben grinned, "Wait for it."

"It's called Shutthefuckupism," Jamie said, "The art of complete and utter silence. This is where the vow of silence comes in, but the coolest part is that it's not just in person. He's on all the social media sites, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, SnapChat. He posts silence and responds to other social media utterances with silence. It's kind of amazing. He has thousands of followers. You should follow him."

At that point Robert raised his arm and gave a thumbs up and then went back to doing whatever he was doing.

"So," Ben said, "who's up for a game of darts?"

"I am," Janette said.

"I, sir," Jamie said.

"Sure," Will said.

"But you know," Jamie lifted a finger. "It would be extra special if we had another round of shots. Who's with me?"

They all were and each gave Jamie some cash for another round. Will pitched in a few thousand pesos. Jamie went off towards the bar and the rest lined up behind the dart board line. They took turns tossing darts, none sticking, no one keeping count. When all the darts were on the floor, then someone would pick them up, carry them back, and they would start again. There was a lull in the conversation but as everyone was heavily sedated by that point it was not uncomfortable.

"Janette," Will asked, "so what are you doing with your time in Chile?"

She immediately responded as if from memory, "I'm implementing a shortwave radio distribution program among indigenous farming communities of southern Chile."

"What?"

"In the forests are communities of farmers going generations back, but currently they have no technology to communicate between themselves, and if they did, it could greatly improve their social well-being in a multitude of ways, primarily preservation of their culture. So myself along with a few others plan to introduce low-technology based communication to the people there as a way to help them see the benefits of inter-community relationships."

"That's pretty cool," Will said, "do they have problems now?"

"Of course," Janette responded, somewhat defensive, "sharing in real-time information regarding the weather, illnesses, tips about crops, not to mention a wider sense of connectedness, not seeing others as a threat but as an extension of your own community. We've already seen good results in a few prototype villages."

"What is the end goal of a program like this?"

"What do you mean?"

"You are introducing new technology to a community, low-grade technology now, and you are seeing good results. Does that mean it will lead to introducing more modern technology later? The Internet, for example?"

"You don't understand, Will. Some of these people haven't even seen a computer. They might understand what it is, but they are a long time from using Twitter."

"I get that, but as you were talking I had a vision of these villages communicating and it seems like eventually they would all merge into one village. I don't see that stopping with shortwave radio. Why would it? Technology doesn't stop. It's like evolution. It keeps developing and adapting. So maybe now they're not on Twitter, but eventually, why not?"

"Then they would be connected to the whole world."

"Well," Janette argued, "that isn't the goal. That would be sad."

"Why sad?"

"Because then there would be a direct line for outside cultural influences to invade the communities. They would lose their individuation."

"You mean kids in the villages listening to Lady Gaga?"

"Superficially, yes. But the whole purpose is to help preserve these ancient traditions. They are slowly dying out. It is a way to help them unite and strengthen those bonds."

"Maybe it is inevitable."

"I hope not," Janette said, "that would be sad."

"You keep using that word," Jamie said, "but that word has no place in evolution, which is what we're talking about really. Technology is part of our evolution as much as an opposable thumb. So, okay, taking this idea in a different direction, are we - I mean modern people - losing our own sense of cultural individuation, from our technology? These days the communication from here to China is a matter of seconds."

"I think we're most definitely seeing a blurring of the lines between cultures," Will agreed.

"But, is that so bad a thing? Why are we any different from those primitive villages? Should our traditions be preserved?"

"I think so," Janette said.

"Now you sound like a segregationist."

"What are you talking about?"

"This conversation is getting way too philosophical, that can't go anywhere good." Ben interjected.

"I don't think so," Jamie said, "it's interesting. We seem to have this idea that certain traditions should be preserved and shielded from the evils of mass communication, but at the same time there is this idea that mass communication is enabling us to increase community. So, which is it? Is the ideal be one global village or many separate villages? You can't have both."

"I'm lost," Will said, his head reeling from the combination of Xanax and alcohol.

"I'm not a political scientist," Janette said, "We can help those people, and so we are."

"Well, I am a political scientist and I think the global village is inevitable, whether we want it or not, and those traditions of thousands of years will eventually be lost forever. It's happened before, and its happening now, and it will happen. There is a tendency in the universe towards unity."

"Entropy," Ben corrected.

"That's just a semantics. Utter entropy eventually begets homageneity, aka unity."

"Wrong, although that's pretty clever," Ben observed, "Utter entropy would be an infinite number of atoms, all separate, all self-contained, neither depending on or communicating with any other. So, eternal loneliness."

"This conversation is making me sad," Janette said, "let's change the subject. Will, what's your story? Why are you in Chile? Are you a student?"

"Wait," Ben said, "I think its Will's turn to get drinks."

"Will's turn!" Jamie and Janette shouted in unison.

"Okay," Will said, "I'll get the next round. What are we having. More shots?"

"I want a drink drink," Janette said.

"Piscola?"

"Alright, yeah," Janette said.

"Five piscolas, señor Will," Ben said, "that is, if you want one."

"What the heck is a piscola?"

"You'll like it. It's traditional. Try one."

"Okay," Will said.

Will walked back through the dining room on his way back to the bar, but stopped first at the bathrooms, which were painted sky blue with white clouds. He did his business, then instinctively leaned over and threw up into the toilet. Everything from the day came up. He saw stars and lost his balance momentarily, catching himself on the sink. He wasn't nauseous. Briefly, the old pounding heartbeat back came back and the old dizziness, but then it subsided. He thought about Constanza, about the person she really was. He wondered if he should say anything about it to the Fulbrights. They seemed understanding enough. 

He collected himself and went to the bar. He expected to have trouble with the order but the bartender understood piscola just fine. The crowd next to him had a tray of pita chips and some kind of creamy salsa, so Will pointed that out to the bartender as well and he acknowledged.

When he returned the Fulbrights were back at a game of darts. The Silent One was standing at a door smoking. Will set the tray of drinks down on the table and a waitress followed him with the pita chips and salsa.

"Oh, snacks, awesome!" Jamie said.

Ben and Jamie came over and dipped out some chips. Will offered some to Robert, who walked over and helped himself. He then asked Janette, who was only drinking.

"I don't eat gluten, sorry."

"No problem," Will said, "are you allergic?"

"Not allergic per se, but anytime I eat processed bread I get a lot of congestion for a day or so."

"Bullshit," Jamie said.

"No, its not bullshit, Jamie, how are you an expert on how my body reacts to food?"

"Have you always had this reaction? Even when your mom fed you peanut butter and jelly sandwiches when you were a kid?"

"How should I know?" Janette said. She threw another dart at the board and it stuck to her surprise.

"I'll tell you when it started, it happened when you first heard from some hippie ass nutritionist on youtube that consuming gluten was toxic and saw all these testimonials from whack jobs about the evils of processed food."

"So you think processed food is good for you?"

"I think we should eat as close to nature as possible, but I also don't think eating white bread causes congestion. What about the billions of people who eat white bread everyday and are just fine. I just can't listen to crap like that."

"Why are you being so angry all of a sudden?"

"It's just a pet peeve of mine. All these kind of people are just privileged snobs if you ask me. You'd never see a starving child refusing a slice of white bread because it wasn't as pure as unprocessed food."

"Fuck you," Janette said.

"And what do you think is in that piscola you're drinking? They might use real cane sugar in the cola down here, but its still refined as all get out."

"Whatever man, I'm trying to have a good time tonight, and you're killing my buzz."

Ben walked over to Jamie and whispered into his ear. Jamie nodded and walked to the back of the room where the Silent One had found a new spot.

Will took a drink of the piscola and tried to think of something to break the tension.

"So, you guys want to hear why I'm here?" Will said, "I promise its a good story. It's fucked up to tell you the truth."

"Yes, please Will, let's talk about something fun for a change," Janette said. She grabbed Will by the arm, "Tell us!"

"I am here about a girl."

"That old chestnut?" Ben winked.

"Aww," Janette said, "so you came down here to meet your true love? How did you meet her?"

They each clinked their piscolas in a toast.

Jamie came back over, his curiosity piqued.

"Wait, what did I hear?" Jamie asked, "I feel like I missed something. Are you and Ben getting married?"

"No," Ben blushed, "Will came to Chile for a girl. We haven't heard the whole story yet."

"It's kind of embarrassing to be honest. I met her online and we talked for a month or so, like everyday, and somehow it came up that I should come see her, and the other day I said fuck it, and bought a ticket."

"Fucking killer man. Kudos," Jamie said.

"So where is she?" Ben asked.

"Well, I just flew in this morning, and we were supposed to meet up at the Juan Valdez down the street. But, she didn't show at the time we agreed, and then there was this picture."

Will pulled the photograph from his back pocket, now wadded up, and showed it to them.

"Cute," Ben said.

"She's really pretty," Janette said.

"I know, but the only thing is its not her. Its some Chilean pop singer, named Ana Tijoux. The baristas showed me there at the coffee shop."

"Oh my god!" Janette gasped.

"Dude," Jamie said, "that is the catfish of all catfishes! Holy shit!"

"What is a catfish?" Janette asked.

"Oh, Janette," Jamie shook his head in mock disappointment. "Have you not been keeping up with your memes. One does not simply not keep up with internet memes."

"Ain't nobody got time for dat!" Ben shouted. Everyone laughed.

"A catfish is when you get to know somebody through Facebook, OkCupid, whatever and they turn out not to be who they say they are. It's from a documentary. I don't know why."

"So what happened then?" Ben asked, genuinely concerned.

"Nothing. I mean, it just happened maybe thirty minutes ago. I came directly over here from there."

"You need to call her right now!" Janette shouted, "I wonder who she is."

"I can't call her because I don't have her number. Just email."

"Well, email her then. Say, who the fuck are you, bitch?" Janette was upset.

Jamie pulled out his phone and opened the browser. "You say you can email her, here use my phone, send her an email. This is like a mystery. You just have to see her, find out who she really is."

Will took the phone and signed in to his Gmail. He found the last email from Constanza and responded with a simple message.

	Who are you really? I would still like to meet you. D

He hit send, handed the phone back to Jamie, and told the others what he sent.

"That's good man," Jamie agreed, "Direct and to the point."

They played another few rounds of darts and had another round of shots. Jamie apologized to Janette and they hugged it out. Everyone was drunk by this point, Will had to slow down after the last round of shots, because combined with the Xanax, he found he could barely keep his eyes opened. 

They all sat around on the couches, the darts spread haphazard on the floor in front of them. The Silent One was asleep. Ben and Janette sat close together, but not touching. Jamie was looking at his phone. Nobody was talking. There was lively music filtering in from somewhere outside, a live band.

"Well," Ben said, rising slowly, "whose up for a walk to Plaza Italia!"

"Taxi maybe," Jamie looked up from his phone.

"I'm not going anywhere near that place," Janette argued, "Not tonight. The Carabineros will be all over with those protesters out. The metros shut down at eight, I heard somebody talking about it earlier."

"But the gigantic screen, the game! I can't miss it before I go back to the Atacama. Jamie, you in? We can taxi it, I don't care. I just want to go, man. Come on!"

Jamie put down his phone.

"Wait a minute, what is Janette talking about Carabineros? Why will they be out there?" 

"Because," Janette explained, "those protesters are going to be out in the Plaza tonight."

"The Dogs?" Jamie asked, concerned, "Those guys?"

"Uh, si señor, los Perros de Santiago. The same ones who smashed all those windows down Moneda last month and set fires in the streets."

"Okay, I'm not going then. Don't feel like dying tonight, thanks."

"Wait," Ben argued, "there's gonna be hundreds of people out there watching the game on the gigantic screen. If they are okay with it, what's the big deal?"

"They're not gringos." Janette argued. Ben thought that was a good point.

Will had been listening and finally his curiosity got the better of him, "What are you guys talking about? I am totally lost."

"Oh, sorry Will," Jamie explained, "You just picked the absolute worse time to come to Santiago since Pinochet."

Janette picked up, "There's this group, Los Perros de Santiago, the Dogs of Santiago, they started as a student political organization a year or so ago, holding organized protests around the inequalities of the Chilean school system, where those with connections get all the opportunities, while those without the connections are left out in the cold. It made international news."

Ben sat back down, explaining further, "It was a good thing actually. Got people talking, thinking. They would not relent in their message. They shut down the schools, barricaded them with makeshift walls of desks."

"All so people without a voice could get an education?" Will asked.

"Yeah, basically," Janette said, "It was an idealistic crusade at its core. And it could have been successful, people in the government were starting to listen, starting to agree with them.  Talks were happening. But then it spiraled out of control."

"What happened?"

"The message got bigger. See, it started with a very specific goal in mind, and all the anger and outrage was directed at righting this particular wrong, the inequality of the school system. But, the leader of the Dogs started injecting all this anti-capitalist propaganda into the protests."

"And the students ate it up," Ben said.

"Well, yeah," Jamie said, "because a lot of it is true. It's all connected. As they started looking into the heart of the issues, they could see it all stemmed from a conscious effort by the wealthy minority of the country to foster a more American capitalist social structure into being. Chile is not a wealthy country, relatively speaking. They have the copper mines and a few other agriculture exports, but they have always been a somewhat second-world country. And of course, the folks on the hill want to change that. They see it as a kind of patriotism actually."

"So what happened?" Will asked, "What does all that have to do with a soccer game on a gigantic screen in Plaza Whatever?"

"Plaza Italia," Ben corrected, "Well, like we were saying, it started with protests. You can't really imagine these protests, they were officially sanctioned and scheduled. The government said, you can protest here and here, from this time to this time. So the students would comply. They would say, okay, everybody show up at Park Bustamante at 1800 on Friday and we will protest. So everybody would show up, and they would get angry and speechify and shout, and the carabineros would be there, on standby at the fringes, and then it would be over and everyone would go out and party."

"Fucking weird man," Jamie said, "I remember the first time I saw it. I just got here, before the Fulbright program, staying at hostels. One day I was walking down Moneda, most of these protests happen in the business district for obvious reasons, and there was this tension in the air. The streets were empty. You could cut the tension with a knife, pardon the cliche but that's what it was like, man, almost a tangible thing. And I didn't know what the fuck was going on, just walking down the street like an asshole, with my head up my ass."

"Sort of like always," Janette laughed.

"Whatever, bitch," Jamie winked, "so I came to this area, this wide open area, the square with the capital building, all this manicured landscaping and statues, marble. And there were about a hundred college students, shouting and raising their hands. They had signs. There were carabineros on horseback, carabineros wearing riot gear, with the shields and everything. And it seemed like a single wrong look could set the whole thing off like a stick of dynamite."

"It really is like that," Ben agreed.

"The one detail I always remember is that as I stood in this potentially violent situation with dozens of angry people, I turn around to walk back and on the other side of the street is this frail old lady, carrying groceries, as if was just another day. She didn't seem to notice. It calmed me somehow."

"You haven't answered my question yet," Will observed, "Why the big deal tonight?"

"Well," Janette picked up, "as the protests became more anti-capitalist and philosophical in nature, they naturally became more angry because there was no way to directly answer the issue, not in a tangible way. So things escalated. Then one day, back in the summer, the Dogs held a protest outside the sanctioned place and time. This really made people uneasy. For the first time they called out tanks and armored trucks. The government brought out the pepper spray, water canons, billy sticks. Then it happened. Some kid threw a brick into a crowd of carabineros and hit one of them in the head. There was an all-out brawl and needless to say the police beat the kids down. They were unprepared for anything like that. This did not make international news, for obvious reasons. The powers that be wanted to keep it secret. So, that's how it happened. After that there were no talks. Protests happened on short notice, promoted on Twitter and other social media. The government scrambles each time and violence is the norm rather than a feeling in the air. The kids regularly set fires in the streets. Destroy property. And the carabineros blast them with water cannons, pepper spray, and beat them senseless with billy sticks."

"So," Ben said, "now you know. There is a game in Plaza Italia tonight and word on the streets is, the Dogs are gonna be out there too, to get some visibility for their message."

"There's one thing you left out," Jamie added.

"What's that?" Ben asked.

"They hate Americans."

"Oh yeah," Ben said to Will, "They hate our guts, being the spoiled offspring of the capitalist system."

Will sat in silence and processed what they had just told him.

"So," Ben said at last, "you up for it?"

"Why are they called The Dogs of Santiago?" Will asked.

"You just got here," Janette observed, "but haven't you seen the stray dogs all over the place? They're everywhere in the city. People just tolerate them here. They ignore them for the most part, but some feed them and make sure they have some warmth during the winter. You may have seen some with these vests on. They are named after those stray animals of the city, a metaphor. For what exactly I'm not sure."

"It sounds cool, basically," Jamie added.

They all laughed. Finally Will said, "Fuck it, I'm in. I could use some exercise."

Ben jumped up and slapped Will on the back.

"Let's do it, man. We don't have anything to worry about, trust me. It's gonna be an awesome game. Wait till you see this screen. It's fucking huge."

"Gigantic even," Jamie added.

Jamie walked over and woke up The Silent One. Ben grabbed their coats and handed them out. Will stood up and realized he was much too drunk to make any intelligent decision about whether to go into a potential violent situation. They headed out the back door, through the empty courtyard and stood on the street, where a few cabs were waiting. Janette waved to one of them and it immediately zipped up to the curb, smoke curling out of its tailpipe.

"It is fucking cold out here," Jamie observed. He threw on his peacoat and opened the cab door. Janette climbed in, then Jamie, then the Silent One. When the door was shut she rolled down the window.

"Hey, you guys be careful. Stay in the crowds. Will, it was nice to meet you. I hope you meet up with that girl."

"Nice to meet you too, thanks."

The cab pulled off and turned the corner. Ben lit a cigarette and offered one to Will. He refused.

"What is it you do here?" Will asked, "I don't think that ever came up."

"I'm an astronomer," Ben answered.

"You don't seem like an astronomer."

Ben laughed.

"What do I seem like then?"

"Cab driver," Will offered.

"Nice," Ben said, "I could do that I suppose. Feel like hoofin it for awhile?"

"Let's do it," Will said.

The both of them rounded the corner and headed down Pedro De Valdivia towards Plaza Italia.


Four

It was a cold night, clear. Gazing up the stars were visible even with the street lights. Will and Ben walked a brisk pace towards Plaza Italia. Traffic was light, a cab every now and then. They passed the Los Leones metro entrance and saw the gates were pulled down, even though it was still early. A homeless man asked Ben for a light at a bus stop. They stopped and then resumed almost without missing a beat.

Will looked down an alley and had something like deja vu. It made him shiver. This time yesterday he was driving to the airport. And now he was here. At this time yesterday he thought he would be walking down the street with a pretty Chilean girl named Constanza, but instead he was walking with an American astronomer named Ben.

"So what does an astronomer do in Chile?" Will asked.

"Heard of the Atacama observatory?"

I've never heard of Atacama."

Ben laughed.

"It's the driest place on Earth, a desert north of here. There is an observatory. We do our work there."

"What is your work?"

"Right now, looking for proof of dark energy."

"I've heard of that."

"Yeah, it is one of the more important theories in the field."

"I've always loved astronomy. Thinking about space. The infinite."

"Same here."

"Is space infinite?" Will asked.

"Depends on what model of the universe you accept," Ben replied, "Although nobody really knows. Anybody who says they do is full of shit or trying to get your money. Or both."

They crossed a large intersection with traffic and plenty of open restaurants. Will smelled the food and wanted to stop for something else to eat. He saw a McDonald's in the distance and wondered what a Big Mac here tasted like. Did they even have them?

Ben stopped once they crossed the intersection.

"Listen, you want to grab a cab the rest of the way. It's a good  twenty minute walk from here."

"I'm okay with walking," Will said, "I like seeing the city at night."

"Cool," Ben said. They continued walking.

"So, that sucks about your girl, man," Ben said, "are you bummed?"

Will thought for a moment.

"To be perfectly honest I got hammered before I got a chance to get bummed, so you'll have to ask me in the morning."

Ben chuckled.

"I hear you."

"What about you and Janette? I noticed a little something there."

"Who knows, man?" Ben said, "That's been a long and winding road."

"She's cute."

"Yeah."

Ben walked at such a fast pace Will had trouble keeping up. He never stopped at the intersections if there was no car coming, even if was a no walking sign.

"Are we headed in the general direction of Moneda?" Will asked.

"Yeah, Moneda is past Plaza Italia. That where you're staying?"

"Yeah," Will said, then returning to the previous subject, "Anyway, you probably don't have much to worry about. I bet you astronomers get all the ladies."

"You'd think so, but unfortunately that's not the case. We're pretty fucking nerdy to be quite honest."

They came to an area where the streetlights were either out or non-existent. It was dark, but Ben navigated confidently through a few strange turns. Will caught his reflection on the glass of a small shop and saw his breath fog.

At that moment a loud noise sounded in the alley behind them. It sounded like someone banging on a tin can with a baseball bat. They saw two teenagers in hoodies emerge from the alleyway walking in the same direction as them. Ben gave Will a nervous glance and then suddenly picked up his pace. Will picked up his pace as well and gave a quick glance back to see if the two teenagers were still there. They were.

"Keep walking," Ben whispered, "If I say run, start fucking running."

A cab came by with its lights off and Ben walked to the curb and tried to flag it down, still keeping his pace. The cab drove by in silence and continued past them.

One of the teenagers shouted, "Hola, gringo!"

Ben looked at Will and kept walking at a rapid pace. It was clear the two teenagers were gaining ground. Will looked in futility at all the closed businesses around them. If only it could be a few hours earlier, these businesses would not be closed and they could go inside, out of the dark, where it was safe. But it was now. It was always fucking now.

A baseball bat slid into Will's heel and tripped him up momentarily, but caught himself. Ben shouted, "Run!" but Will had already sprinted ahead by a few feet. Everything slowed down and out of the corner of his eye Will saw a hand reach over Ben's and grab hold. He was jerked around hard and pushed to the ground. Will kept running. The teens were shouting in Spanish in Will's direction. He stopped. One of the teens kicked Ben in the stomach and held a box cutter up to his cheek. Ben nervously pulled his wallet out of his pocket and threw it at the teens. Will stood his ground, afraid to come closer.

The other teen looked up and they exchanged glances. There was a meanness in his eyes that seemed unnatural in a face so young.

Two headlights came down the street shining brightly on the scene. The teenagers took that as a cue to bolt, so they left Ben there on the ground and disappeared into an alleyway. The car passed without stopping.

Will ran over to Ben who had gotten up and was dusting himself off. Ben was shaking all over and jumped when Will put his hand on his shoulder. He smelled urine.

"Hey, it's just me," Will said, "they ran off. Let's get out of here."

"Yeah," Ben said, dazed.

They took off down the road until they were back in a more well-lighted strip of the road. Then they stopped.

"Fuck," Ben said, "Fuck. Can't believe those fuckers mugged me. That's the last thing I needed, man. Shit."

"I'm sorry man," Will said.

"Did they get you?"

"No, the headlights scared them off before they got to me. Fuck man, I should have listened to you when you said we should get a cab."

"No, fuck that man. You didn't know we'd get mugged."

Ben took a deep breath. He started looking at the road. There was more traffic.

"Look, man. That really freaked me out. I don't think I can handle a crowd after going through that. I'm gonna head back to the hotel and call it a night. My fucking ID was in my wallet."

"No problem, Ben. I understand," Will said.

"Can you spot me a few thousand pesos, or so, so I can get back to the hotel? Gonna stay right here til a cab comes."

Will reached in his wallet and pulled out the money.

"I'll stay with you," Will said, "Think we should call the cops?"

Ben looked up, surprised, "No way man, too much headache. They're not gonna find those punks."

"I'll stay," Will said, "fuck the game."

"No, go on man. I'm not feeling much like company now anyway. It was nice to meet you, Will. Maybe we'll meet up some other time."

They exchanged email addresses, then Ben stood up and held out his thumb for a cab. Will stood there.

"You sure you're okay?" Will asked, unsure whether he should go.

"I'm good man," Ben said.

"Alright, take it easy," Will said, and then turned down the street. Ben did not respond, but Will turned back a few minutes later and saw Ben getting in the back of a cab. 

He was alone again. He continued down the street, in the direction Ben had said Plaza Italia was. The events of the mugging replayed over and over in his head. Had he acted cowardly? Was that why Ben had acted so upset towards him just now? It was the first time he had been in a situation like that. It was true what they said, how time slowed down. Each moment was clear in his mind. A more courageous person might have run back immediately to help his friend. Was he a friend?

There were more cars appearing now, more people on the sidewalk. He passed another metro stop with a gated entrance. His heart had still not calmed down. He did not make eye contact with anyone he met. When they had left the California Cantina the empty streets gave off a peaceful, serene feeling but now they felt sinister. Every locked door, every homeless man in a doorway felt like a violation, like a some kind of evil invading the world. 

Will felt he was was not in a good state of mind to be entering a crowded space. Maybe he should get a cab too, return to the Hotel Riveria and sleep it off. Maybe decide what to do about Constanza. Had he already sent her an email? He wasn't sure if he had. Who was she? Why had she catfished him? The person who had those late-night conversations with him, who was that? He was so happy to have found her. When they talked they even completed each other's thoughts. Not in that cheesy way, but in a real way, a spiritual way. She understood him, thousands of miles away, she knew who he was in a way even his mother did not. But was all that a dream? Did it even happen the way he remembered?

As he came around a turn in the road, immediately he saw lights in the distance, brightening the face of buildings down at the end of the road. He saw people, cars. He heard the roar of a crowd, music. He kept walking. As he got closer he could make out more and more specific sounds, there was a band playing in the small courtyard of a place in the park. Will started to make out the large screen. He saw the larger than life players on the screen. Then, when he got very close, and the plaza opened up, he saw a large group of protesters off the side, standing in an open concrete courtyard. There was a metro entrance there, Baquedano, also gated. The protesters were nearly all young, angry, some had the same meanness in their eyes. They wore military jackets and earrings, carried signs with slogans Will could not understand. But he recognized the symbols they bore: a fist raised in anger, a gas mask inside out, a dollar sign made out of flowers, a baby with a skeleton head, the Chilean flag burning.


Five

Now there were dozens, perhaps hundreds of people surrounding him. He continued making way through the crowds. Then there was a tightness in his chest that at he first he could ignore but slowly came over him like a panic. He stopped, knelt on one knee, and caught his breath, taking a few deep inhales. It was not a heart attack, his inner voice reassured him, only some anxiety, brought on by the people. Stars appeared at the corner of his eyes and floated away. He gazed up at the jumbotron and followed the game. He saw a player in blue shorts take a dive then swept his leg towards the spinning ball at the moment before landing, the ball angling off his foot towards the goal. It hit the net with a tremendous force and in unison the wall of spectators surrounding him leapt on their feet and cried out in joyful applause. Will joined them, shouting and waving his arms.

"El gato!" he screamed, remembering one of the phrases from the audio lessons he had worked through on the flight down, "El gato encima de una mesa!"

A woman next to him gave him an odd look, then laughed, "El gato!" she answered.

Will saw everyone around him was holding drinks and hotdogs. He wandered towards the edge of the crowds, looking for the vendors, hungry and perhaps a little drunk. But the tightness in his chest had passed for the time being.

On the circumference of the crowds were dozens of vendors selling all kinds of things, trinkets, paintings, fake silver jewelry. He passed a cart with a man selling hot nuts, Nuts for Nuts, and found a stand selling hot dogs and beer.

"Uno cerveza, por favor."

The man nodded and gave him the price which he did not understand, but he saw the sign, a thousand pesos.

"And a hot dog. Hot dog," Will asked, pointing to the bin of boiling dogs.

"Completo?" the man asked.

"Si, si. Uno completo, por favor."

The man quickly pulled a bun from a bag and took a hot dog with a pair of tongs. He assembled the completo and slathered it with mayonnaise and onions, some tomatoes. Will winced at all the mayo but didn't say anything. He handed the man five thousand pesos and told him to keep the change. The man nodded graciously and put it into the drawer.

He walked around the outer edge of the people and scooped some of the mayo onto the sidewalk. It was good and he chased with the cerveza and it also was good, although not so cold as he would have liked. But it was a cold night. The hot dog warmed him inside. He put his hands into his jeans pockets and watched the people who watched the game. They were happy. There were families there. Will watched one family for a little while. The son couldn't see the screen so the father put him up on his shoulders. The mother stood beside him, nestled against the father's side. At their feet a stray dog ran past, sniffing for scraps, but not finding anything so far. He continued deeper into the forest of legs and feet and Will lost him.

After a few more goals Will started paying more attention to the game than the crowd. Without knowing it he fell back into the middle, his eyes, like most, fixed on the illuminated screen. The announcers voice boomed through the speakers at either side of the park, rumbling.

Will, not really aware of himself at this point, began repeating each phrase that came through the speakers. The people around him stared and looked suspicious once they saw he was not Chilean. He then found a group at least as drunk as himself and gravitated towards them. He didn't know what they said to him, nor they what he said to them, but it was a good time.

One man laughed hard every time Will repeated the announcer and put his arm around his neck. The Chileans scored another goal and they all hugged and downed their cervesas in salute.

"We don't get this excited about sports," Will told the old man, "In America, and I just figured out why."

"Estados Unidos?" The old man said.

"Si," Will said, "Estados Unidos of America."

"Estados Unidos!" They all shouted. One of them handed Will another beer. He took it graciously.

"I have figured it out," Will said, to the group although no one understood him, "it's simple really, and I guess maybe you already knew this, but I hadn't realized it. You get so excited because it's your country up there. It's not a city, or a school, its your freakin country up there, representing you. That's why it means so much. It's like war. It means something!"

Will shouted so hard he saw stars float in from the sides of his eyes. He felt the pressure again, the old pressure on his chest, the panic sinking in. He stopped immediately, all the joy he was feeling gone in an instant.

Those around him stopped for a moment and then returned to the game. Will looked up at them in his panic and saw they cared nothing about him. He was drunk, they were drunk. He found the family again, the boy on his father's shoulders. Somehow it made him want to cry. He did what he was supposed to do and breathed in slowly and methodically and counted to sixty. Soon the stars went away, the dizziness. It passed.

By this time the game was coming to an end. The Chilean team was up by two and there wasn't much hope for the other team, Portugal maybe? Will couldn't tell. Might as well be Portugal. Some of the crowd was beginning to disperse. Will felt uneasy. From his anxiety and the excitability of the crowd, and the protesters at the edge of the square. There was a wind, like a blowing through the crowd, and it felt like static electricity. He felt like it would be best to get back to the Hotel Riveria as soon as possible.

He was drunk, very drunk. The jumbotron lit up his face and he tried to make out the final score but could not. It was a blur, a drunken blur. His head was on the cusp of spinning into nausea, but not quite. He stopped where he was and looked at the ground to find something solid to focus on. He saw a pile of cigarettes, one smoldering. He saw the place where the grass met the concrete lip of the curb. He saw shoes, outdated shoes, they no longer wore in the States, LA Gear, shit like that. The game was over and the people were going home. They were happy, but not happy the game was over.

He thought about Ben. Had he acted like a friend to Ben, back there? It was blurry. Maybe it was not important. Yet he felt like it was. Maybe he should have insisted to go with Ben. Ben had been frightened, more than he let on. Will was frightened too. Why was he here? Why had he come here? He looked up at the stars and saw them through the thin clouds. They would look the same back home, thousands of miles from this place, this alien landscape, where the inhabitants eat hot dogs with a gallon of mayonnaise.

There was shouting. Will looked up and saw a group of Chileans carrying chairs. Where did the chairs come from? They were celebrating, he supposed. Some were smiling. Others looked like they wanted blood. He stood up as they came upon him and before he knew it, he had joined in, keeping pace with them, marching, where he couldn't say. Will held up his beer and shouted along with him. He laughed and saw another man around him laugh. As they went others joined in. A song broke out among some of them and Will tried to keep up, humming along. It was a cheerful song, with loud bursts of energy.

One of the men in the group threw his chair into a crowd of people walking past, hitting a woman over the head. She fell to her feet and held her head. The crowd gasped and continued walking. Music was playing from somewhere far to the north, towards the jumbotron. Will didn't know what direction he was going. He decided it would be better to get out of this crowd and head towards Moneda. Extracting himself from the group was not as easy as it looked. It was wild and growing wilder by the moment. The laughs and good-naturedness he had felt at first were not anywhere to be seen. The man next to him growled and shouted something at the top of his lungs, beating his chest.

They were on the street. He looked up and saw the traffic lights. They changed from green to red as they passed under. Where were the cars? Why were they on the streets. He stood on his toes and tried to find the edge of the pack. He couldn't. There were dozens of them, spanning the street, walking in unison. Songs broke out at random and Will tried to act like he belonged but was afraid of being spotted for the outsider he was. Suddenly he burst out, "El Gato! El Gato, Encima. En-Ci-Ma. De Una Me-Sa!" and repeated that a few times. Nobody seemed to notice. For some reason a chair passed hands in front of him and he found himself holding it. He raised it above his head and shouted "El Gato!" a few more times.

Turning around, he happened to spot the jumbotron way in the distance. Where were they going? It was not easy to tell. It seemed they might be headed in the general direction of Moneda, but he could be wrong. There was smoke in the air. Smoke. It had been a clear night but a cloud of smoke rolled in from the east. People panicked. A hairy arm gripped his shoulder and pushed him to the side. A small man ran out of the group as fast as he could, pointing with one finger behind him. Will turned and before he knew it a police officer on a horse was coming through the crowd, shouting with a bullhorn.

People scrambled. What was once a tight, solid mass disintegrated into the wide street. They were far from the game. In fact they had crossed the street into the square, where the protestors stood. Only now they weren't standing. They were approaching in their own packs, shouting at a shielded wall of carabineros in riot gear. Will didn't know where to go so he jumped over a small concrete barrier and went down some steps into the entryway to the metro, closed now.

The officer with the bullhorn continued to shout. It was impossible to say what, but it sounded strangely composed considering the stewing violence above. There were some others down there with him, a couple holding each other close, an old man with a cane, a few young kids with scowls. He took a moment to collect his thoughts, acknowledged he was quite drunk, even though he had been sobered from fear. His vision blurred when he tried to stayed focused on one spot for too long. It smelled like urine where he stood but at the moment that was the least of his concern. The man on the horse came close to the outer edge of the entryway, near the steps.

At that moment a young girl came up behind the horse and lit a small firecracker at its feet. She darted off seconds before it exploded like a gunshot. Bang! The horse heeled up with a force Will had never seen and tossed the officer up and backwards down the concrete steps to the metro. He flailed midair and caught himself with one extended arm on a side rail and Will could hear the bone snap in his forearm as he tumbled over and the arm would not release from the rail. The bullhorn had fallen to the ground and shrieked with feedback, further exciting the horse who didn't know where to step at this point. He fumbled backwards, towards the steps, and lost his back footing at the first step down. The horse collapsed, falling backwards, end over end, down into the metro entryway. The guard braced himself as the horse flailed and neighed in horror. He held out one arm and pulled his gun from the holster, firing into the horse's head. The horse gave one last scream and fell limp. 

At the sound of the gunshot everyone down there, including Will stampeded towards the steps. It was like a clap right in your ear. It was like pure violence. Before anyone reached the top of the stairs a group of carabineros appeared surrounding the entryway. They all held up the transparent body length plastic shields and tossed a canister spewing an orange smoke into the pit. The guard below shouted to no avail. One of the young teens raced over and picked up the canister. He held it out with one hand and drop-kicked it outside the pit where they all were. This invigorated the rest of the bunch. The young man shouted to everyone and waved his hand forward, like the famous American statue from World War I. Everyone followed his lead up the steps out of the metro entrance.

As Will came out of the pit he saw everything had gone to hell in only a matter of minutes. What had been a threat of violence, a wind, a feeling in the air, had become real. Was right there in front of him. His eyes went to the windows of the high-rise apartment complexes surrounding the city center, peering eyes, watching from up high, from warm, safe rooms fifty feet in the air.

Then there was a burning in his eyes; he breathed in the orange smoke. Pepper spray. Without ever having had experienced it he knew for sure that was what it was. His eyes were instantly tearing up. He couldn't see more than a blur, even after wiping his eyes. A few more officers on horseback circled the perimeter of the metro station and shouted to the rows of carabineros in riot gear. Something was coming. Will ran off in what seemed the safest direction, away from the police, towards the barred storefronts where the students had stood their ground earlier.

As he approached he saw small packs of them crouched behind concrete barriers. He ducked behind one and caught the glance of a young man, ecstatic with the things he was seeing. His long dark hair was pulled into a ponytail. He nodded to Will and gave a slight look as if wondering why he was here. At that point a small group of students ran up behind the barrier and gestured to everyone to follow them down a side alley. Will stayed put, until the young man in the ponytail reached out and grabbed him by the arm. After taking a quick survey of the plaza, seeing the approaching march of armored carabineros, seeing the orange haze giving everything a fire and brimstone hue, remembering the horse tumbling down the metro steps, remembering the gunshot in his ears, he took off after them.

Down the alley, the road opened into a narrow side street, surrounded by high walls with greenery overhanging, hitting him in the face. He got off the sidewalk into the center of the street. The streets for some reason were wet and he slipped on his face but got up immediately as there were dozens of others around him and he didn't want to be trampled. He tasted iron, tasted the blood that dripped into his mouth from somewhere around his forehead, but didn't stop running.

He followed behind a girl in a jean skirt and converse all stars and thought briefly about how nice her ass was, until the insanity of the situation caught up with him but he still stared. Everyone around him was younger, college age. They rounded corners every couple blocks. It was impossible for Will to know where he was or where he was going. Soon the came to a larger road and one of the students at the end of the street had lit a plastic and concrete barrier set up by the police on fire and pulled it into the middle of the road. Everyone cheered him. But at that moment a large riot vehicle pulled around the corner and a voice came over the loudspeaker and echoed down the alleyway, saying things Will did not understand.

The vehicle was like a long tank with four giant wheels, draped in iron sheets, a tiny slit at the front to see out of. A man opened a lid on the top and manned what looked like a large swiveling gun. Will was vulnerable where he stood, out in the middle of the road, but was so afraid he couldn't move. No one moved for a couple seconds. A sound like water through piping filled the alley, and then large gush of water spewed from the gun, but not at the barrier on fire, at the students, at Will.

Before he knew it, he was on the ground, blown by the force of the water cannon. A few others around him were soaked through and rose quickly, the water shining from the light of the flames. Will rose when he saw the riot vehicle slam into the barrier and push into the alley where everyone was. He ran with a group into a dark hidden path and watched the riot van rumble past at thirty miles an hour. For that moment everyone was quiet, breathing heavy, everyone listened to each other's breathing and was quiet. Will caught the eye of the man with the ponytail. He closed his eyes and was quiet.

Some of the protestors removed their soaked shirts, wrung them onto the sidewalk, and held them up to their faces as a filter against the pepper haze that was now filtering through even the back alleyways. Will removed his own shirt and did the same, exposing his white, flabby gut. He noticed the others observing him, the outsider. They were all skinny, dark-skinned. A girl had a black bra. The man with the ponytail reached out to Will and wiped some of the blood from his forehead. He held it up for everyone to see. He spoke to the others in Spanish. His words grew louder as he continued. He made wide gestures with his hands. There was an anger and a desperation to his words, a youthful frustration. Some others wiped the blood from their own wounds and held up their hands together. He pointed to the Plaza and shouted angrily in that direction. The others shouted as well. Will stood there, his head spinning. He knew he was not a part of this but didn't feel like he could leave either. He was here. He was a part of this, because he was here. If he was back at home, in his room, watching Netflix on his laptop, he would not be a part of this. But he was not back at home. He was here.

In unison the group began to march back to the Plaza. Will thought to run in the other direction. There was nothing stopping him from slinking off a side street, but there was a euphoria inside him that wanted to see the outcome of all the anger and violence he had so far witnessed and participated in. He joined them. Along the way they picked up stray rocks, sticks, anything that could be used as a weapon. The streets were dark, unnaturally so, as if the electricity had been cut. He looked up at the buildings and saw towers of darkness, no lights at all. No more faces. But echoing off them were sounds of the riots, screeching tires, sudden shouts, the spray of a water cannon, footsteps. Will glanced at the other's faces as they ran - one boy was clearly afraid, another calm, one raging, another covered in blood.

The noises grew louder when they came around the last corner. There was a bus stop ahead, the plastic panels broken out. An old woman sat silently on the bench, ignoring the violence happening all around her. The only indication she gave of her surroundings at all was a small tissue held over her mouth, to keep out the pepper spray. She gazed solemnly ahead. Seeing the old woman brought Will out of his euphoric state momentarily and he stopped, taking in the full view of the Plaza.

It was madness. Smoke obscured everything in a drab orange fog. There were small fires in the middle of the streets, made out of debris, newspapers. Temporary barriers were blocking the main throughways, wide four lane streets. Pockets of protestors stood behind makeshift barriers, some still brandishing signs, most just communicating with shouts. Then there were the carabineros. Perhaps dozens of men and women dressed in riot gear, body armor, padded helmets with face shields, long black batons. A few officers on horseback. Dark-windowed vans, assault vehicles like the one that sprayed Will's group with water. They were organized as possible, trying to contain the shapeless protest, which seemed to have no point of origin or easily recognizable heart at which to direct their force.

The group continued into the fray, led by the pony-tailed young man. His face gave away no hint of fear, or anger really, only a determined glare. As they approached a row of plastic barriers, a girl in the group hurled the concrete rock she carried high up in the air and it fell just shy of a small group of carabineros. Following that a few more threw other objects, nothing serious, mostly rocks, a bottle, a scrap of wood. Nothing dangerous to a person with an inch and a half of kevlar shielding to protect them. But it got their attention. The group of carabineros quickly turned and headed towards them.

There was a melee when the group met the body-armored policia. Before he knew what was happening, Will was there in the middle of a dangerous fight. The carabineros easily overpowered the young protestors, although they spit and fought back as they could. A baton came down on the boy next to Will and bloodied his nose. The boy crouched into a fetal position and lay there prone. Will reached down to try to help him back up again, but the boy only kicked him away. At that point, a rough hand came down on his neck and shoved him roughly to one side. He glanced over his shoulder and saw an ugly face behind a plastic shield staring him down. The carabinero swung the baton square into Will's back and brought him to his knees.

Without thinking, Will swung up with all his body weight and knocked the carabinero dead in the chin, causing him to stumble backwards. The baton fell from his hand and Will picked it up. He twisted onto his feet and tackled the carabinero, beating him repeatedly with the baton over the face shield. The carabinero did all he could to try to get Will off his chest, but the armor restricted his movements to desperate flailings. One after the other Will came down onto the carabineros face shield, his eyes wild, his mind unfocused with rage. Then, as if someone flipped a switch, he stopped, dropped the baton, and scrambled away from the ruckus altogether. He bolted towards Park Bustamante, where there were no lights or people. He did not turn around to see if anyone followed him.

Will did not pay attention much to his surroundings as he ran. He tripped over a sleeping dog on the grass and fell flat on his face. But he was up again in an instant, running not so much from a specific thing, as from the noise and once the echoes seemed far enough away he slowed down, only then stopping to catch his breath. He dropped on one foot and put his head in his hands.Nothing made sense anymore. Reason and logic and action following action no longer seemed to apply, here in this place. Anything was possible, any kind of horribleness. Will fumbled in his pocket for a Xanax but somewhere along the way must have lost the bottle, because it was not there. The poor man, he winced at the fear in the carabineros eyes. He had seen them.

It was dark but he could see the outlines of the large trees there, the black limbs reaching over him. He rose to his feet again and kept walking away from the Plaza. Slowly he came to his senses again and checked his pockets for his wallet and hotel key. Luckily they were still there. He felt all over his face and found a large gash on his brow, where his hairline met the forehead. There was also a bruise on his lower back, from where the carabinero had hit him. Other than that he was okay. He was still drunk, but the adrenaline in his system overruled the effects. He was wet, but not soaking. He could see okay. He was thinking clearly but couldn't be sure of that.

He emerged from the park onto a narrow road paved with cobblestones. The night air was cold on his skin, and now that he was calmer he felt the chill and shivered. Goosebumps ran up his arms and he folded them into his chest for warmth. Crossing the road he came upon a small chain fence. He walked some ways down and heard moving water coming from somewhere nearby. He stopped and listened for it. There it was, on the other side of the fence. He placed two hands on the fence rail and heaved himself over the side, not counting for the steepness of the bank and tumbled down a grassy slope into the freezing river.


Six

He stood up in the river and watched the water flow around his legs in the moonlight. He cupped some of the water in his hands and spread it over his head, slinging back his hair in his hands. The water washed the blood from his wound. He walked over to the bank and climbed out again. He fell to the grass and lay there, not moving. He listened for the sounds of the protest and heard them far off. It was hard to tell how far. He needed to keep moving, to get as far away as possible. What had he done there? The stars in the sky shone bright overhead. Will gazed at them for some time before he returned to his senses. It was dark. He could see a long way down the street, but all the stores fronts and signs were darkened. He wondered what time it was. Now that the adrenaline was leaving his bloodstream he felt the briskness of the night air on his forearms and he noticed the alcohol still affecting his perception. He was not afraid. He was lost.

To the north, beyond the concrete high rises he heard faint music, or he thought he did, drums and music. That seemed the most promising direction to go since it was not in the direction of the riots and since it was music it was bound to be a more happy atmosphere. He pulled himself over another short fence and continued on the sidewalk, catching his dim reflection in the large windows he past along the way, and if he could blend in he could pretend he was never involved in those protests from just a few minutes ago, pretend he had never punched the carabinero in the face with a baton, maybe ask directions to the Hotel Riveria. He thought of his bed and then suddenly of the old, one-legged bum who sat outside the hotel. His forlorn, wrinkled face which became all smiles when he had dropped in those pesos.

He passed building after building, sheet metal, barred windows, newspapers wet and plastered on road sign poles. Graffiti he could not understand in bright neon colors, a sad sulking donkey wearing a greaser jacket. There was nothing he saw that reminded him of home. It was all foreign, all alien and weird. The city was only a city, but uninviting and depressing to him. Even the trees and flowers planted along the sidewalk made him feel alone, the large unfamiliar leaves. Why had this loneliness all of a sudden overcome him. It was not there before. Maybe it was a reaction to the violence he had just witnessed, just been a part of. It made him sick and the louder the music became the more he wanted to be there, around the lights and people again, to drown out this feeling in his soul.

Then he saw a person, a man urinating against a building, out in the open, the steam rising from the yellow stream. He was drunk, that was obvious. Will kept walking past him, not even looking from the corner of his eye. The music was louder now. He quickened his pace and turned a couple more corners. There at the end of the next street was a cross street, filled with people.

He emerged on Pia Nono like a visitor from another planet. Here were dozens, maybe hundreds of people, partying, living it up. Didn't they know what was happening only half a mile down the road? It didn't appear so. Will felt safer here. He felt all of a sudden as if the events of the last hour and a half had not really happened, they were distant somehow, far away. He did his best to blend in, he was after all dressed for a night on the town, although soaked and bloodied. He past a lime green tacqueria and walked inside. Once there he ignored the hostess and found the bathroom, a small closet next to the kitchen. He looked at himself in the mirror.

"Good God," he said. He barely recognized himself, although it was hard to say why. He pulled some paper towels from a roll on the sink and dried his hair the best he could. He wiped off some dried blood that ran down his left cheek. His beard also had some dried beads of blood in them. A young man came into the bathroom at that point and Will turned around, "Occupied," he grunted, "Occupado!" The boy looked at him and then closed the door. Will combed out the tangles in his hair. He tucked in his shirt, which was drying out. It was dirty and covered with some grease stains on the sides, but in the night it could pass as presentable.

There was a karaoke bar on the opposite side of the street from the tacqueria and Will ducked inside there to wait things out for awhile. On the stage in the center of the place was an older man and much younger woman singing a duet, Jackson by Johnny Cash and June Carter. They were doing a pretty good job and everyone was smiling and dancing. The bar circled the stage on the outer edge of the building. Will went to the corner and asked the bartender for agua. He was handed a plastic cup filled with tap water and drank it down fast. There was a soapy taste to the water but he didn't care. He watched the couple sing and when the song was over he clapped like one of the regulars.

Back in the corner he saw a group of people laughing and among them he thought he saw Ben. It was Ben, sitting next to a pretty South American woman, and a group of five others.

"Hey Ben," Will said, waving as he approached the table, "Hey I thought you were going back to the hotel?" 

He shook Will's hand, but did not seem to recognize him. Will noticed his confusion.

"It's Will, man." He laughed. The man still looked confused.

"I'm not Ben and I don't know who you are. Sorry."

Yet it was Ben. Will was certain it was him. The same polo shirt, blue. The same jeans and jacket. The people with him were unfamiliar, but it was him. Will stared without trying to come off strange.

"Look man," The man said, "I'm not Ben and we don't want any trouble here. It's clear you've been drinking. We're just trying to have a good time. Can you please leave us alone?"

"But you are Ben, right? I mean, we just hung out a couple hours ago at the California Cantina, with Janette and the Silent One."

"No, man," The man rose from his stool, "I'm not whoever you're looking for. I'm not him. So get the fuck out of here before I call security! I'm getting tired of this crap."

Will stood there. Everyone at the table had stopped talking and was staring at him as if they were afraid of what he might do. Will nodded to them and walked outside. giving a single glance back. It was Ben. It was. Why was he pretending not to know him? It made no sense at all. 

Will continued up the street, which began to incline steeper as he reached the next intersection. He passed couples making out as they walked, groups of young men strutted in packs, an out of place family of four walking hand in hand. He passed bar after bar, music clubs, jazz clubs, different music at each corner. He looked in the windows and saw the people inside, huddled together around a small stage where someone sang or played guitar. He needed a place to chill for awhile, a place to clear his head. He decided to catch a cab back to his hotel. Fortunately there was a row of cabs lined up on an adjacent street. He crossed over and walked up the hill to where the cabs were, yet before he made eye contact with anyone a hand reached out and touched him on the shoulder.

"Excuse me, sir?" A man in a long coat asked him. He was neatly dressed, in a suit and jacket. He held a clipboard and carried a walkie talkie on his belt.

Will stared at him.

"Sir, are you an American? Are you from the United States?"

"Yes I am."

The man took Will by the hand and led him up the hill, away from the cabs and towards a large warehouse building.

"Follow me, please," The man said and let go of his hand.

Will followed with caution, unsure if he should run or just go with it. At the top of the hill there was a line of people, all dressed to the nines. There was a large sign on the warehouse door that said, Galpon 9. The man with the clipboard led Will past the line of people, all Chileans, and unclipped a rope behind the bouncer at the door. He reached in his pocket and handed will two pieces of paper, took his left hand and stamped it.

"Drink tickets for you," the man said, smiling, "Welcome to Chile, my friend, and have a good time!"

He opened two large wooden doors and loud thumping dance music poured outside. Will entered and the man pulled the door closed. Inside there were waitresses in short black skirts walking with trays held high, security guards wearing black t-shirts and black pants standing under an archway. Beyond the archway was an enormous dance floor where perhaps a hundred people danced in a tight pack to electronic music and swirling lights of every shade and color. He felt every beat and thump reverberate through his body. The sounds were so loud they made everything seem far away.

Will approached the bar and handed a drink ticket to a waitress, shouting into her ear for a cerveza. She winked and walked away with a tiny hop as he pulled up a stool. "What the fuck am I doing here?" he said at normal speaking volume. Nobody could hear him anyway. How was I in Georgia yesterday and today I am three thousand miles away in a night club after participating in a student protest. At that moment he remembered Constanza, the fake photo, and all those feelings. Who was she? Was she ugly? Was she really a she? Who had been on the other side of the computer screen all those nights, all those nights that turned into mornings, when they discussed love and art, politics, everything. Was she here tonight? He glanced across the room at the multitude of women, most dressed in short revealing skirts, some in shorts with high boots, dark haired women with smooth skin and curves.

The girl brought back his drink and he downed in a few long gulps. He thought about Ben. Was it really him in the karaoke bar? He was almost sure it had been. The same clothes and hair, same face. Briefly he considered the possibility he had gone insane. They said you never know if you go insane for real. It's technically impossible to be cognizant of your insanity. Maybe that's it. Maybe it happened during the flight down. Maybe during the mugging. Or maybe while witnessing a horse being put down with a bullet to the head. Or being sprayed with a water cannon and chased through the streets by an armored vehicle. Or by being deceived by Constanza. Fuck. Why did that have to happen? It was so good and it had to go bad, like always. And the money for the ticket, but fuck the money. Money is just money. It could have been something real. Someone, somewhere is trying to tell you something, Will. You need to leave this wicked place. Go to your hotel room right this instant and leave in the morning. Fly back to the States where you belong, where you were born and where you will die some day a long time in the future, when your hair is gray and wiry and your dick doesn't get hard anymore. He ordered another drink.

Upstairs it was more of a lounge-type vibe. There were long rows of white upholstered couches lining the walls. The bar was in the center of the floor, the hardwood had gaps so wide you could see the dancers below. Will found a cozy place at an empty two top and nursed his third beer. How much had he had to drink already. Goddamn this was the craziest pub crawl in the world. He laughed. "Fucking pub crawl!" He laughed hard, exaggerating his laugh in his drunkenness. "El Pub Crawlio Del Gato!" He yelled again. Some people around him began to stare but he didn't care. They hadn't just gone through a heartbreak, a mugging, a violent protest, and a dip in an ice cold fucking river, did they? "Fuck no they didn't!" He shouted, "Fuckers!" and leaned way back in his chair until he hit the person behind him, a woman.

"Sorry, Jesus, I almost fell off."

"Okay, man," the woman said, "Don't worry!"

"You know English? Speak English?"

"Yeah, man!" she shouted. Her shoulders bunched up in excitement as she took a sip from the cocktail straw, "Gringo, come sit with us!" She took Will by the hand. Her hand was delicate and so soft. He felt immediately in love with her and pulled his chair around.

The group was the woman, a young Chilean woman of maybe twenty-two or twenty-three, an older man, closer to Will's age, maybe early to mid thirties, and an older, and very thick woman, who did not seem to fit very well within the group. She looked bored and didn't make eye contact once with Will.

"I'm Will."

"Margarita, and this is Felipe and Rosa. Say hi to Will everyone."

Felipe took Will's hand and nodded to him. He took an instant liking to Felipe, a short man with a humble smile, short cropped hair. He seemed to be humoring Margarita, who was perhaps as drunk as Will.

"Rosa!" Margarita snapped her finger at the woman, "Say hola to Will, my new Americano friend."

Rosa turned back to the table and pulled a cigarette from a fake gold case next to her drink. She lit the cigarette and puffed as she looked Will up and down.

"Hola," she said finally.

"Hola." Will returned.

"Don't mind Rosa," Margarita said, "she's a fucking bitch."

Will looked at Rosa to see her reaction, but there wasn't one.

"She don't know English. I the only one."

Will nodded and then clinked his beer with her cocktail glass. She laughed. Felipe stared curiously at Will but did not speak. He sipped on a plastic cup of water.

"Are you guys from Santiago?" Will asked, looking specifically at Felipe, as a way to break the ice with him.

Felipe looked confused and glanced over to Margarita. She repeated something to him. He nodded in the affirmative and took another sip.

"He doesn't know English either?"

"No, man, I told you. I the only one who knows English at all."

"Well, why do you know English and nobody else does? Are you trying to pick up some rich American guys or something?"

Margarita giggled and rubbed up seductively against his shoulder.

"Maybe so, maybe so."

There was a lull in the conversation when Will couldn't think of anything else to talk about. Felipe shifted his gaze from Margarita to Will and back again. Rosa finally got up and walked to the bar, where she struck up a conversation with one of the bar staff leaning against the counter.

"So Will," Margarita said, "why are you in Chile? Are you on vacation?"

"I'm on a international pub crawl."

"Que? What is that you said?"

"A pub crawl. I go from bar to bar, drinking." He held up his bottle. Margarita didn't follow.

"A joke," he said, "Nevermind."

At this point Felipe too got up, whispered something to Margarita, and put his hand under her forearm. She pulled away abruptly and looked away from him. He exchanged glances with Will and then walked across the floor and headed downstairs, leaving Margarita and Will alone.

"Good," Margarita shouted, "I'm glad he's gone."

"You don't like him?"

"No, not at all."

"Who is he?"

"That's my old boyfriend, from a long time ago."

"You're not with him?"

"No, I don't like him anymore."

"Fair enough," Will said.

"What?"

"Nevermind. So what do you do? What is your job?" 

Will found it hard to speak clear and loud enough so she could hear over the music at the same time. Her English was okay, but not the best. He could tell she struggled with more complicated phrasings.

"Teacher," she said, smiling.

Slowly they were leaning closer to one another. She was certainly beautiful, with long shiny hair, young pretty eyes, and a figure beneath her tight fitting blouse and pants. Her dangling feet brushed up against Will's leg ever so subtly.

"What do you teach?"

"English, of course."

"Oh yes, of course."

She began laughing and covered her mouth with her hand. Will laughed too and took another sip from his beer.

"Hey," he said, leaning in closer, "I've got an idea. Let's dance!"

"You want to dance? Okay!"

She held out her hand and Will took it inside his and stood up, letting her take the lead down to the dance floor. Her body was small and they stepped close to one another on the way down. A rhythmic song was playing and she immediately turned to Will and put his arms around her waist, she draping her arms over his shoulders. Lights from the crystal ball overhead swirled around the room and Will felt dizzy and hot, but ignored everything except making sure his movements were synchronized to hers. After a few minutes he took her hand and held up it and spun her around so that her back was to him. She leaned into him while still swaying to the music. Will found himself bobbing and nodding to the music, the Spanish words. He looked out over the crowd and saw a multitude of others doing the same. Some couples, some by themselves, swaying to the music. Her arm reached up and she grazed his beard with her fingers and continued up to his hair. He met her hand with his own at the top and intertwined his fingers with her own. Her eyes widened up at him and she smiled, then twisted around again so they were facing one another.

He leaned in and put his mouth on her bare neck, just under her left ear. She fell limp in his arms and breathed deeply in.

"Do you want to kiss me?"

Will looked up but did not respond.

"Kiss me."

He kissed her slow and hard, both of them moving in time with the music, which pulsed like a heartbeat. And then it ended. For a moment on the dance floor there was silence as the DJ fumbled with his laptop to bring up the next song. But the spell was broken. Margarita looked at Will and took a few steps backwards.

"I need to use the bathroom," she said.

"Me too."

They both walked off the floor as the next song came on, a more aggressive melody filled the room and the dancers reacted by jumping together.

There was a line to the bathrooms and they each parted to the separate line, glancing at one another, smiling.

Will had a thought about Constanza but immediately put her out of his mind. It came his turn in the stall and he stared at a faded photograph above the urinal of a broken down building in the middle of the city, burned in a fire. He turned to his right and saw a Chilean spitting and wiping his forehead, clearly drunk out of his mind. He finished and waited on Margarita to emerge. When she came out, Will suggested they go upstairs to get another drink. She agreed and they walked together, holding hands, up the staircase.

Will went directly to the bar and ordered a cerveza for himself and a rum and coke for her. He turned and leaned against the bar and found Margarita sitting on one of the couches next to the stairs. Rosa was there and they were chatting and laughing. When the drinks came he brought them over and set Margarita's down on the small table next to her. Neither she nor Rosa looked up when he came over, so he sat down next to Margarita on the couch and sipped on his beer, nodding to the music, surveying the people walking by.

Soon Felipe walked up the stairs and both Rosa and Margarita greeted him with smiles and a hug. He whispered something into their ears and they laughed. Will sat there with his beer. Margarita had not glanced one time in his direction since he returned from the bar. He tapped his feet impatiently and began to feel like he was not invited to the party. Briefly he caught eyes with Felipe, who nodded to him. At that point Margarita turned and noticed Will, but then turned immediately around to Rosa. When his bottle was empty Will stood up and carried the bottle over to the bar and set it down. Then he walked past Margarita, Rosa, and Felipe and continued downstairs. They took no notice of him at all.

Downstairs the room had become a sauna of writhing bodies. The place was packed with dancers, swaying, jumping to the endless rhythms that echoed off the high ceilings and brick walls. Will descended the steps and became one of them. He began swaying the music before he reached the floor and continued when he got there. At this point he didn't give a fuck anymore. And he danced that way too. There was a group of young Chinese girls beside him, all dancing together, glowing neon necklaces around their necks. Will jumped right in the middle of them and did a half split. They recoiled and went off in another direction.

"Go on, then," Will shouted, "Nobody likes Chinese food anyway!"

He stood up and swayed with the music for some time, finding a wall to lean up against. He felt like he needed some support. His head swirling from the noise and the booze. But then he felt a hand rub on his chest and he looked up and saw a woman there, dark-haired, staring him down. She flipped her fingers seductively in his direction, gesturing for him to follow her. So he did.

She was not so pretty as Margarita, somewhat older, harder. But she was sexy as hell, wearing a sheer sequenced skirt and black blouse that draped over one shoulder. Her breasts heaved out of the low-cut top. Her hair was frizzy and tangled. It was hard for Will to make out her face behind all that hair. For no reason at all he laughed as he followed her out onto the dance floor. He had a feeling of deja vu and thought about Margarita, and then he thought about Constanza, and all the other women he had ever been in love with went by in a flash. But put them out of his mind. The present moment was king, after all.

They danced together, Will and this woman, whoever she was. Try as he might, Will couldn't get a good look at her face. He wasn't sure if it was the alcohol or the light or the hair, but he never could get a bead on her eyes. But she could move. Her hands were all over him. He took this as a sign and started putting his hands on her. First her waist, cupping her thin frame with both hands, then wrapping his arms around her and moving slowly closer until they were touching.

He kissed her. She kissed him back. They wrapped their arms around each other and continued to move with the music, now a slow, jazzy tune, but with a lot of bass. He pulled her into his body and felt her leg caress the inside of his thigh. He was hard and was sure she could feel it too. Who was this woman?

"What's your name?"

She did not respond. He asked again, this time leaning in to her ear, brushing her hair over her ears. She didn't know English. She shook her head no in time with the music and he thought it was just as well and continued kissing down her neck and chest.

They danced for a couple more songs, and by this point they were practically copulating on the floor. Her leg was draped around his hip and they dropped and rose with the music. At that point she whispered into his ear, "Hotel."

Will looked at her, nodded, then took her hand and led her off the dance floor. Before he realized it they were outside the club, staring up at the stars in the night sky, a row of people still standing outside in the freezing cold. Down the street were the rows of cabs. He led her by the hand and waved down one of the cabbies and off they went.

"Hotel Riveria," he said to the driver, his face emerging momentarily from her neck.

"Hotel Riveria. Si," the driver said.

"Hey, don't go down Plaza Italia, whatever you do. There are fucking riots down there. Carabineros."

"Si, si," the driver said, admiring the woman's dress from his rearview mirror. He took off at full speed, a dangerous speed Will thought as he buried his face into a deep french kiss.

She was as into him as he was her. Her breathing became heavy and hard. She pulled him closer into her breasts and wrapped her legs around his. He felt her hips and traced the edge of her thong. He glanced up and saw streetlights and people walking, heard honks. Her tongue was moist and hot inside his mouth. She penetrated him over and over again until he fought back and penetrated her, grazing her lips with his teeth ever so roughly.

The cab pulled to a stop, and the driver put the flag down on the meter.

"Hotel Riveria," he said, and then pointed to the price on the digital readout. Will rose and fished five thousand pesos from his wallet and handed it to the man.

"You keep that, señor."

"Gracias, Gracias," said the driver.

Will and the woman stepped out and he shut the door. The driver was off again, leaving them alone on the curb. The streets were empty, dark. There was a small light coming from inside the hotel. At the entrance was the same sleeping dog as earlier in the day. Will opened the door and pushed the dog out of the way, and led the woman inside the lobby.

It was darkly lit inside, the young clerk at the counter was watching YouTube videos on a laptop and ignored them. Will pushed the button for the elevator but it appeared to be out of service, so they instead took the stairs. It was five flights up and Will himself go light headed as they round the third bend. The woman seemed to have limitless energy though, and pulled him up, going faster and faster as they climbed.

At last they arrived at the room and at first Will almost didn't recognize it. But there were his clothes strewn out on the twin mattress. There was his toothpaste on the bathroom sink. They fell onto the bed, into each others arms, she on bottom, him heaving off his shirt and pulling her face into his chest in one smooth motion. She bit his nipple and licked over his chest, feeling around his back. They were upright when she collapsed onto her back and undid the buttons of her blouse, sliding out seductively, revealing a pink satin bra. Her skin was smooth, lit by the flickering red and blue hotel sign across the street.

"You're very beautiful," Will whispered, lowering himself to her breasts. But she covered herself before his lips touched her skin. She gently pushed his head up to meet hers, and her eyes were suddenly cold, dark. With her fingers she made a slow but firm gesture to indicate she wanted money. He stared at her fingers, entranced by the rhythm, still very much drunk, and rose on his side. He reached over to the nightstand and picked up his wallet, pulling out a handful of bills. He showed her a few and she nodded no, so he showed her a few more and she took it from him, folding the money into her purse. In the same movement she brought out a condom in a shiny orange wrapper, laying it beside them. She grabbed Will by his hair and pulled him into her cleavage, Will reaching up and pulling off the bra, exposing her breasts to his kisses. She writhed beneath him. The pace of his breath quickened as he aroused her. His mind was dull with alcohol and the remnants of sedatives but he was clear-headed enough to know who he was with and put any other competing thoughts out of his mind. It was easy to do. What was left was an artificial focus on the present, the sensations going through his body at a single moment.

Now they were naked. She was on her hands and knees, receiving him, moving in time with him. He held onto the curve of her hips and thought about nothing, he even whispered it at one point and laughed, "This is nothing, nothing." He felt nothing, the sensation with the condom was dulled. They had been going for some time and he sensed her impatience, her lack of passion. He increased his pace, hoping to feel something, forcing it to happen. And then, he did feel and could hold on no longer. He felt the condom break inside her and came, not stopping until all sensation had drained from his loins. He collapsed on the bed beside her, removing the torn pieces of the condom and holding them up so she could see. When she saw she panicked and jumped up into the bathroom. There in full view she cleaned herself with her fingers. Will turned away. She began cursing, finished in the bathroom and returned, where he heard her put on her clothes, mutter something evil to him under her breath, and then she walked out.

He was alone in the darkened hotel room. Awake but not fully aware. It might have been half an hour before he rose and stood there. He turned on the light and a single incandescent bulb illuminated the space where he stood and not much else. Outside he heard cars, a siren, a car alarm. His thoughts turned inward and he blocked out all outer noises. The only sound he could hear then was the beating of his heart. It was unbearable to him, so he put on his boxers and a tshirt and turned on some music, something acoustic and happy. He turned it up and sat on the bed. But then he had a thought, and rose to take a shower. He stepped into the stall before the water was at a comfortable temperature and ignored the cold. He scrubbed himself multiple times, using soap, then shampoo, then rinse and repeat. Afterwards, he dried off. He pulled out an Ambien from his bag and drank it down with a cupped handful of water from the sink. Just the thought of the heaviness of sleep calmed his nerves.

He paced throughout the small room, his thoughts confused and hazy. He wanted to feel light again, to feel goodness again, but there was a shadow over this day, something sinister he sensed without being able to articulate exactly what it was. Perhaps at first he was an observer to it, but somewhere had begun to participate in it. No longer was he just an observer. These thoughts led nowhere, only round and round. Eventually he stopped pacing when he realized it was probably the hypnotic effect of the Ambien. But a moment later he started picking things up, organizing things. He put the laptop back in its bag, he folded all his clothes and put them on a small chair in the corner. He found a stray sequence from the woman's blouse and threw it immediately into the trash. Soon the room appeared to him to have odd angles and he realized the drug was working.

Thirty minutes later he was in bed, not asleep but definitely feeling the heaviness in his eyes, the blissful euphoria of the hypnotic kicking in. He laughed and thought about the day. What a day. And now it was gone, out into the universe. His mind went out, and out, and out, from the bed in the Hotel Riveria to the sky above the Andes to the atmosphere above the Southern Hemisphere,  on into space, into the silence. There he floated and caught one hand on the International Space Station, spinning in orbit. But he let go of it. Who cares, he thought. And kept going out. He turned away from the Earth and towards the infinite darkness. A meteor the size of a truck flew by him and he reached out to it, holding on. The meteor carried him far away from the Earth and the Hotel Riveria where he was sleeping. On the meteor it was like a desert, the hard rocks and sand. But he held on because it was familiar and he felt like it was something he was supposed to do. So he did it. He stayed on the meteor past Mars, Jupiter and all the gas giants. Neptune, the sight of Neptune frightened him for no reason and he would not open his eyes again until it was a pinpoint of light. They were speeding up, the entire time they had been gaining velocity and the stars went by like headlights. It was at that point Will realized there was no reason whatsoever for the meteor. It was just a thing. And his body was a thing. There was no reason to hold onto it anymore, so he let go. The meteor kept going until it was out of sight and he was there, somewhere, floating but still going very fast, safe. It was safe here. He passed planets of every size and color. He saw civilizations older than the Earth. From here he could see everything, even the future. He looked and saw the future of the human race. The future where we escape the boundaries of our home planet and explore other parts of the universe. The future where every man and every woman has their own planet, there is enough for everyone! And every man and every woman lives alone, on their own planet, where there is no life.

Will rose from the bed, halfway between a dream and reality. At first it was space and stars, then slowly the bathroom light appeared and then the nightstand and the clothes on the floor. By the time he reached the window his dream was gone. In the windows of the building across the street he saw animal faces of every kind, watching him. He knew there were no animal faces, but he saw them just the same and studied their details with fascination. The night sky swirled with colors like a blanket. He lay back in the bed and watched a giant spider's legs stretch across the ceiling and blend into the bands of street light coming in through the blinds. But he was not afraid.

His delirious mind conjured images of Constanza, the woman he had fallen in love with through a computer, and who probably never existed at all, whoever she was. How many nights had he thought of her, imagined what it would be like to have a cup of coffee and talk, look at her. This was the first real relationship since the time of trouble a couple years ago, since the anxiety and the depression revealed their horrors to him. It made him feel sick when he imagined a man. If only were at least a woman. Did she even arrive at the Juan Valdez. Why did he leave. First thing tomorrow he was going to find her, see her, whatever it takes. Maybe she was deformed in some way, maybe just shy to show her real face to someone she met that way. There were a hundred explanations, why had he reacted in such a childish way before. After all, he had come so far. So far from home and he must see her.

His foot sank into a dip in the cheap flooring and he felt a combination of nausea and dizziness and momentarily lost his sense of balance. He stared at the floor to steady himself. On the floor was an old magazine, in Spanish, a bright garden on the front, dusted with cobwebs. As he stared at the magazine it seemed like he could see infinite detail in the photograph, trees, leaves, veins, cells, molecules, atoms. It was like a zoom lens effect and for some reason it horrified him. He wanted things back to normal so he closed his eyes instead. But he still saw the floor below him, the cheap faux wood flooring with dips and cracks. He imagined a mouth opening up in the floor and swallowing him whole. Then he fell into a dark void.

As he fell he spiraled end over end and finally reached out to steady himself, and there was something there. A chasm with walls made from long, sinewy muscles, with dark blood running through them. It was hot and he felt a paralyzing fear of the muscles because they were alive. As he fell the walls of the chasm closed in around him. He curled up to avoid the darkness enveloping him and cried out to be forgiven. "Forgive me, O Lord. Please forgive me, for the multitude of sins I have committed against Thee."

He was there, at dawn in the springtime when he was only eight years old. At the bus stop with other children. He watched himself from above, like an angel he watched himself and the others poke and pester an old cat with a stick. The cat scratched him and inside an eruption of anger caused him to lash out at the cat and hit it in the eye. The eye burst into a red goo and let out a slow low-pitched howl of pain. Will recoiled from the cat. He dropped the stick and ran from the bus stop, weeping at what he had done. He ran and ran, down the street to his grandparent's house.

In the front yard was a 1953 Buick, faded blue, the paint and windows covered in a mildewy green film. It was cold out there. Frozen in fact. The grass beneath his feet were like icicles that crunched as he walked across the yard to the old Buick under the tree. He tripped on a tree root and fell onto his knees, bruising his right shin, but he got up again and reach the car. He pulled hard on the handle of the passenger door and the cold metal stuck to his skin. He jerked it away and tore some of the skin away, but not to the point of bleeding. But then the door opened on its own and he climbed in. 

You could not see outside the windows at all, but there was a dim light radiating through the mildew and ice, illuminating the front seat. His father was there, beside him. Will was not afraid to see him there. He was glad his father was there, old and gray, dressed in a suit like he was at the funeral. They did not speak, only sat there together for an indeterminate time in silence, a peaceful warm silence that filled him with a sense of belonging, a sense of home.

"What is it like, to be a father?" Will asked him, finally.

"It's wonderful."


II.

Seven

He had been awake since seven according to the digital clock on the nightstand, and lay there looking at the opposite corner of the room without really seeing the chair and the small TV which inhabited it. Outside the traffic noise continued without stopping, until it was only a muffled roar that your ears ignored. A construction crew had torn up the sidewalk just around the corner of Miraflores and there were sounds of jackhammers and men shouting directions in Spanish. It was now eleven fifteen.

His body was sore from the walking and his stomach was weak from the alcohol. His mind was a blur of confused and hallucinatory thoughts and memories from the night before. He tried to make some sense out of things but finally gave up and just lay there in contemplation, resting but without the benefit of sleep. It was always like that on Ambien. It knocked you the out for hours on end but then you woke up with bags under your eyes and a feeling like you needed a nap.

The stillness in the room was uncomfortable. It felt like a church, or a morgue, and he suddenly felt a strong desire for movement, for some sign of life, and that finally got him to roll over and put two feet on the floor. He picked up the phone to order some coffee but the man on the other end only spoke Spanish so he gave up without even trying. He rose and stretched his arms over his head, his yawn becoming a howl towards the end. He washed his face in the sink without looking at himself in the mirror and put on some jeans, a sweater, and his flip flops and walked downstairs bypassing the rickety elevator. His knees ached but it felt good to move and he picked up his pace by the third flight down. Nobody else was in the stairwell and he heard his footsteps echo off the walls.

In the lobby things were quiet. The same clerk from yesterday was there, the impatient old man with a comb-over and tight short sleeve button up shirt. He glanced up from the phone when Will entered and gave him a nod. Will returned the nod and continued into the cafe next door, connected by a short corridor.

In the cafe were patrons standing in line for lunch, entering and leaving by the separate entrance. Will stood in the back of the line and felt dizzy. He had not remembered to take a Xanax when he got up and he felt the slow withdrawals, the tingling sensation in his arms and neck, the foggy-headedness, the difficulty concentrating. When it was his turn, he asked for a cup of cafe and pointed to a buttered croissant in the glass case beside the register. The girl behind the counter asked him something he couldn't understand and he impatiently told her, "I don't speak Spanish. I don't speak it. Sorry." He handed her a pile of folded pesos from the night before and she took them and straightened two of them out before placing them into the register. The rest she handed back to Will with a frown.

Back in the room Will sat on the bed and ate the croissant and drank the coffee. In his hurry to get out of the cafe he had forgotten to get cream and sugar, and the coffee was very strong and bitter. But it gave him some energy. He felt the withdrawal from the Xanax getting stronger, the annoying vibrations in his arms and legs, neck. He took one out of the bottle and washed it down with the last of the coffee, the coffee melting the pill on his tongue so that it got stuck halfway down and he nearly choked. He cupped a handful of water from the bathroom sink to wash it down. Then he laid back down on the bed and waited for the sedative to take effect. He had only taken 1 milligram but he was trying to get off the stuff and so was slowing weaning himself off a quarter, half milligram at a time. After fifteen minutes or so he did not feel any different, the vibrations in his hands were the same, and he felt like he couldn't breathe all of a sudden, so he took another 1 milligram.

Then at last he felt the warmth come over him like a blanket. His mind was at peace. He had just about drifted off to sleep again when he remembered writing Constanza last night and wondered if she had written him back. He rolled to the other side of the bed where on a chair was his laptop. He opened it and checked his email. There at the top of the list of messages was a response from Constanza. A jolt shot through him as he clicked on the message.

My dearest Will, I am so sorry you had to find out about that pic before I had the chance to explain it to you. When I got your message yesterday I was heartbroken and ashamed. I don't know what to say except I'm so sorry!!! I was not trying to mislead you despite the way it looks. If you find it in your heart to forgive me, I can explain everything to you, and I promise you won't be disappointed in me (or my real looks)!

Please come see me today at The Clinic at 1330. We can have lunch and I can show you around the city. Does that sound okay? I will explain everything there and you will understand why I did what I did, C.

PS - Don't be late :-)

He reread the message four times, parsing each phrasing of every line, looking for any clue that she was insincere, but could find none. He wanted to be upset. He wanted to be furious and felt like he should be, but for some reason he had forgiven her in his heart. People are strange. They do strange things for all kinds of reasons and he was past the point in his life where he would let a strange thing stand in the way of a potentially great thing. If she had lied he would find out why and base his decision on that, and what else was he going to do anyway, five thousand miles from home. Now at least he knew what to talk about. There was no way she would believe the things that had happened to him over the last twenty four hours.

It was twelve fifteen now. He still needed to shower before heading to The Clinic. He found the address on Google Maps and saw that it was only a ten minute cab ride. Maybe he could even walk there, see the city in daylight. It was a nice, cool day - the sky clear and blue. He quickly took a shower, not waiting for the water to turn warm and put on the only clothes he had left that were not wrinkled, the old sweater and jeans. By the time he was ready it was quarter till one. He fixed his hair in the bathroom mirror, made sure he had the hotel key and wallet, and walked out, repeating the address over in his head so he would remember it.

As he walked out the front door, pushing the old dog sleeping out of the way, he passed by the row of beggars he had tripped over the day before, with the concierge. The same ones were there, even the old man who had caught his eye, the one he felt ashamed to be seen to give money to. He briefly made eye contact with the old man, who smiled at him warmly, and just as he turned away to the street, to hail a cab, he caught a glimpse of the old man as he turned away, and saw his eyes drawn down in suffering. He only saw that face for a second, perhaps less, but it paralyzed him where he stood. He forgot about the cab, about Santiago, about meeting Constanza and all the rest. And then it was over. And things were back to normal. The people on the street continued, the cars drove past in a hurry, the old man and others shook their styrofoam cups at passersby. Will stood there, his hand raised for a cab.

Soon a cab pulled up quickly to the curb, Will wasted no time and jumped in the back seat. He gave the driver directions to the Clinic, but the driver nodded before he finished, knowing the place. He put down the flag, looked over his shoulder, and pulled back into the street. Will sat back and glanced out the window towards the group of beggars. There, on the old man's lap, was a crudely drawn sign in green marker.

"Stop," Will said, "Let me out here. I have to do something else first."

The driver stopped the cab and turned around to face him with an annoyed look.

"Here, señor?" 

"Si, muchas gracias," Will handed him a thousand pesos and got out.

The tires screeched as the taxi drove off before the light at the corner changed. Will walked over to the group of beggars and specifically to the old man with the sign. He pointed at the sign and asked the man what it said, but nobody understood him.

"What does that sign say?" Will repeated, but the old man just smiled at him, shaking the cup with a feeble hand. He turned to the pedestrians and looked for someone who might know English. He asked a lady wearing a red scarf over her hair but she didn't know. He asked a short man with a cane but he ignored him. Then he remembered the landlord of the Riveria.

"Señor," Will said to the landlord, who was talking to one of the hotel staff behind the counter. The landlord looked up.

"Si?"

"Can you follow me please?" Will waved him towards the door and the landlord, reacting as if something bad had happened, followed him quickly outside.

"What is it, sir? Has something happened?"

"No," Will replied. He walked him over to the group of beggars and pointed at the sign the old man was holding, "I need to know what this sign says. The one there." He pointed to it.

"It says, must travel San Bernardo. See my son Felipe."

"Where is San Bernardo?"

"Hold on, my friend, what is this about? That man is an old drunk and I must return to work now. Please do not waste my time. Thank you," The landlord turned abruptly and walked back inside, offended.

"Where is San Bernardo?" Will asked the old man. The man grinned.

"Si, San Bernardo," he pointed with his hand towards the buildings across the street.

"But where? I want to help you, but I don't know where that is."

Once again he stopped people on the sidewalk, asking if they spoke English, where San Bernardo was. After some time he remembered the Spanish for what he wanted to know.

"Hola," he stopped a couple, "Que es San Bernardo? No comprende Espanol. Do you speak English?"

"Si," the man said, "yes, I know a little. You want to find San Bernardo?"

"Yes, do you know how to get there?"

"From here I don't know," the man turned to the woman next to him and they conversed in Spanish.

"Maybe try the bus. The bus will take you there."

"How far is it to San Bernardo from here?"

"Que?"

"How far is it?" Will stretched out his arm.

"Ah, not too far. Less than an hour by bus. It is outside Santiago. Not too far."

"Good," Will said, "Muchas gracias." 

He shook the strangers hand and the continued on their way. Will approached the old man and knelt beside him.

"San Bernardo, si?"

"Si, San Bernardo."

"Come, señor. I will help you find a bus that will take you there."

Will reached underneath the old man's arm and helped lift him onto his feet. The blanket across the man's knees fell away and Will saw the old man was missing one leg at the knee. He wrapped one arm around the man, who hopped weakly in place until he found his footing. One of the others passed up a single wooden crutch for the man to use. Will handed the crutch to the man and saw his hands were gnarled with arthritis, so he tucked the single crutch under his opposite arm. He picked up the blanket and placed it over his shoulders.

"Let us find the bus stop, señor."

"San Bernardo, si?"

"Si," Will replied, "San Bernardo."

With one arm around the old man's waist, he walked with him down the sidewalk at a very slow pace, one crutch movement at a time. People passed them like they were standing still, but soon they were around the corner down Moneda and saw the bus stop a few blocks down. Will pointed it out and the old man nodded and concentrated on placing his crutch in the right spot. Will made sure to let him do most of the work to walk, his arms were only there for support, in case he lost balance, which did happen.

At the bus stop they sat on the benches and waited for the next bus. When it arrived Will asked the driver, "San Bernardo?" and the driver responded but Will did not understand what he said. So he asked a few passengers where the bus to San Bernardo was. A young girl wearing earbuds answered him from three rows back.

"You need to wait for the Los Condes bus, go to Los Condes station and get on San Bernardo there."

Will thanked her, got off the bus, and sat down next to the old man to wait for the bus to Los Condes. He had not intended to take the man all the way to San Bernardo, only put him on the bus and pay for the fare. But that was ridiculous. He could see the man would never make it there on his own. How in the world did he make it anywhere? Will felt sorry for him but remembered Constanza and felt his chance to make amends with her slip away. It was already one. He imagined her there at The Clinic, waiting for him, thinking he had standing her up because she did not look like Ana Tijoux. He pulled out five thousand pesos, took the old man's hand and stuffed them in.

"Good luck, my friend," Will said.

"Si, si," the old man nodded, smiling. 

Will could then smell the alcohol on the old man's breath, some cheap whisky that burned his nostrils. He shook the old man's hand and walked towards the curb to hail a cab to the Clinic, but at that point the Los Condes bus pulled up to the stop. Will turned and pointed to the bus.

"That's your bus, señor," Will said. The old man smiled.

"San Bernardo, si."

"No, first you have to take the bus to Los Condes. Don't you know that yourself? The girl told me just now."

Will walked back to him and took him by the arm.

"You have to get on this bus. Its going to leave if you don't get on now."

Will picked up the crutch and hopped along with the man over to the opened door of the bus. He leaned inside and asked the driver.

"Los Condes to San Bernardo? Si?"

The driver tried to comprehend his broken Spanish and nodded, "Si, Los Condes San Bernardo. Si."

Will walked up and handed the driver a few thousand pesos. The driver refused to take it and pointed to a change that Will roughly took to mean "Exact Change." He didn't know what to do for the space of fifteen seconds, in which time a line had accumulated behind the old man at the door. Will felt the impatience from all sides. Then he saw a Bip! logo and remembered the Bip! card he bought yesterday at the metro. He pulled it from his wallet and handed to the driver. The driver scanned the card and handed it back to Will.

"Gracias," Will said, "Gracias."

He went to the old man and helped him up the steps, then led him down the narrow corridor to an empty bench. There weren't many empty spots, but an older couple slid over and Will helped the old man down onto the seat. A young woman next to him turned away in subtle disgust and pretended he wasn't there.

"Are you okay now?" Will asked the man, "I have to go meet somebody. I am late, but can you make it to San Bernardo from here?"

The old man looked tired and nodded to Will, although it was clear he barely knew where he was and couldn't possibly understand the English Will was speaking to him. Will heard the doors shut and immediately the bus heaved forward, throwing him off balance. He reached for the overhead handles and caught himself. Then shouted to the driver to let him off, but the driver acted like he couldn't hear. Now they were in traffic, in motion, and Will took a seat next to the old man. The old man nodded off and Will wondered why he was here, what he was doing, and what was wrong with him that made him do reckless things like this. He glanced at his phone. It was already one twenty. He was late.

Eight

In Los Condes the bus pulled into a large station, obviously the end of the line. The driver came on the intercom but Will had no idea what he said, but did catch him say 'San Bernardo' and thus knew they were on the right line.

With some trouble he hooked his arm underneath the old man's waist and pulled him to his feet. The man helped as he could, but not much, although he did grab hold of the crutch and support himself as they inched down the narrow isle to the exit. Will felt the passengers behind him grow impatient at their frequent stops to realign themselves.

As they exited the bus, Will looked around for the next stop. All the buses down the line had signs indicating their destinations but he didn't recognize any of them. There were people walking quickly from bus to bus, making their connections. It was difficult to weave through the crowd with the old man on his arm. A harsh wind blew through the covered terminal and rattled the plexiglass windows behind which ticket clerks stood. Will was not dressed for the cold and shivered; the old man was only wearing thin pants and a linen shirt and noticed when Will shivered, leaning closer into him for warmth.

They passed a policia on patrol in the terminal. Will stopped him and asked simply, 'San Bernardo.' The policia pointed to the other end of the terminal and kept walking, eyeing them suspiciously. Eventually they found the San Bernardo bus and a crowd of people standing in a group beside it. The doors were shut. Will found an empty place on a bench and sat them both down.

Ever so slowly the effects of the morning's Xanax had worn off and Will felt the nervousness and agitation return. His arm vibrated. He had left his pill bottles at the hotel, expecting to return before dinnertime, but now that was looking unlikely. He breathed in deep for a few minutes and closed his eyes. Once in San Bernardo he would drop the old man off, return on the next bus, and cab it from the terminal to the Riveria. Fuck the price. He had to get back to feeling right. Couldn't let it get bad down here. Unconsciously his head had begun to bob and his fingers tapped on his thigh. Write Constanza and tell her he got sidetracked. It was good actually, brushing her off like this, let her know he's not wrapped around her finger just yet.

Then there was a strong smell of urine. The old man had nodded off next to him and there was a large, growing wet spot on his pants. He shook the old man and pointed to the spot on his pants, the man looked down and grinned at Will, then yawned.

"Banos?" the old man asked Will.

"I don't know where a bathroom is. Do you really need one now? It looks like you've already done your business. I don't know."

The man pointed to the middle of the terminal and Will spotted two doors for men and women. He picked up the old man and they shuffled over to the bathroom. Will propped open a stall and the man sat down on the toilet, setting the crutch down, undoing the clasp on his pants with one hand. Will walked off and washed his hands in the sink. Some of the urine had gotten on one of his pants legs and he splashed water on it and dried it with a paper towel. He heard the man in the stall groan in pain and stood quietly outside the stall until he had finished. The man could not see Will from where he was and let out a desperate plea, "Hola, señor. Hola!"

Will helped him get his clothes back on, braced him around the waist and carried him over to the sink, where he soaked his pants leg with water like he did his own. The urine smell was still there but lessened. By the time they emerged the bus to San Bernardo was loading and they got on and found a seat towards the back. A few people near them got a good whiff and switched seats to be further away. When the bus finally pulled away from the station there was a two or three seat radius around them.

The drive to San Bernardo was on a stretch of highway. The tightly packed buildings of the central city gave way to more spread out suburbs, factories, businesses. In the distance the looming Andes snowcaps dwarfed everything. Will stared out the window and watched the traffic and took in the sights. It was the end of the business day, about four thirty, and people were heading home for the evening.

When they entered the area Will took to be San Bernardo, he woke the old man and gestured outside. The old man nodded and leaned forward as if looking to see where the next stop was. He said something in Spanish Will did not understand and nodded with reassurance. A few stops later the man poked at Will and Will immediately stood up and helped him to his feet. As they walked the aisle he felt the eyes on himself and the old man, but paid them no mind.

Once off, Will was now dependent on the old man to direct him where they needed to go. Luckily he was aware of his surroundings and pointed them down the street. The air was cool and the sun was hanging just above the mountains to the west and the entire valley seemed tinged a deep orange. Traffic was minimal, in fact the streets felt somewhat empty, and Will made sure to mark the streets in his mind as they turned and turned again. Most of the time they walked along a high stone wall. Will wanted to ask how much further it was but didn't want to go to the trouble of trying to communicate that to the old man. His arm was becoming tired and he felt too the old man growing weak.

By now they had walked almost fifteen minutes and Will had lost count of the turns, but knew just by following the wall he could make it back to the bus stop. His anxiety had increased and he now felt his heart pounding in his chest and heard a slight ringing in his left ear that went away and came back at random. He had visions of collapsing there on the sidewalk, with nobody around to help him, the old man useless in his condition. He did his best to put those thoughts out of his mind.

It was dusk, five fifteen according to Will's phone, but there was still a good bit of light in the sky. They walked a long stretch of road beside a main road where the traffic zoomed by them at high speeds. They passed a small restaurant in an old broken down house and smelled fried fish. Will's stomach growled. He wondered when the last time the old man had eaten and thought to take a break and go in there for some food, for the both of them, but by now he could tell the old man was single minded on getting back to his home in San Bernardo, to his son.

They entered an area that was run down. Houses with broken windows and collapses roofs weatherproofed with sheets and tarps. The people they met watched them with suspicious eyes and called out to one another. Will suspected it was his presence that caused all the alarm. They made slow progress down this street. There was almost no sidewalk anymore, just a small stone walkway beside the street. The street itself was not paved, only graveled with mud puddled scattered here and there. At some point they began walking on the street itself.

Finally, the old man pointed to a break in the wall and he saw vast rows of shacks beyond the wall, stretching over the hills nearly as far as he could see in the twilight. There were a few lights popping up. Will wanted to stop for a moment to rest his arms. He had been carrying the man since the bus stop. But when he tried to stop the old man encouraged him to keep going, gesturing to the shacks that it was not much further. So Will kept going. He continued walking, his eyes on the ground, letting the old man choose the route they walked. He was only a beast of burden at this point, the arms and legs of the operation. He saw beer cans and cigarette butts among the gravel mud and patches of grass. He saw a glass coke bottle on the side of the curb. They passed a few more groups, young men, who eyed Will with contempt and disdain. He wondered if this route was the best route to return from and looked around for any alternate roads, but it was so dark by now it was hard to make anything out but shadows.

Before long they were within the boundaries of the shanty village. Squat, drab-colored shacks built from scraps of wood, corrugated tin, plastic tarps. There was a thick rotten-egg smell of garbage and underneath all that, sewage. They crept along the main path through the village, a dirt road. As they past the low-roofed homes Will saw eyes peering at them from darkened windows or sometimes candlelight.

"Where do we go from here?" Will turned to the old man, who had been silent, head down, ever since they reached the village. The old man said something in Spanish and nodded in the direction they were headed.

They approached a platform of wood connecting with narrow wooden stairs. As they descended Will grabbed hold of the loose handrails and felt the creak of thin boards beneath their feet. It was difficult to step in sync with the old man, his weak legs and ankles struggled to find the next step down each time, as if expecting there not to be a step. Down they went. It was impossible to see more than twenty feet in front of them, where they were headed. It seemed impossible they would ever find the home. Will did not trust his old eyes, old memory to navigate them successfully and was growing increasingly impatient. The smell of sewage was stronger here. Will looked at his feet and saw a narrow ditch just below the steps, an open sewage line. He nearly wretched a couple times. The old man laughed.

At the bottom were more shacks, each piled on top of the other, added onto another. They all looked the same. Every once in awhile one shack would be painted a bright pastel blue or pink, yellow. These were the nicer shacks. Will looked up and saw a series of outdoor power cables spanning from shack to shack, tied together with twine. Somewhere perhaps somebody had figured out how to wire into the city's grid and got whatever power they had here. Some of the places were lit by incandecent bulbs.

His arm was just about to give out. Will found a bench and sat down with the old man.

"I just need to rest a bit."

They sat in silence. The old man did not speak or move. He only looked down at the ground. Now that the sun had gone down the temperature had dropped a few degrees already. Will tucked his hands in his armpits and curled into his sweater for warmth. Though it was cold outside he was sweating from the exertion of carrying the old man. In the silence you heard the people inside the shacks. There was a baby crying, a couple fighting nearby. Somewhere higher up was a game being blasted out for everyone to hear. There were grunts and shouts. Anytime someone noticed Will their eyes fixed on him and would not look away, as if sensing danger. It made him uncomfortable.

It was past time for another Xanax and he could feel the encroaching anxiety. His heart rate was beating faster than it should be and his left arm buzzed. He needed to find the old man's place, drop him off with the son, and head immediately back to the bus stop. Perhaps even grabbing a cab.

He stood and and reached underneath the old man's arm to lift him up as well. The man groaned in pain.

"Where do we go now?" Will asked, "Which way?"

The old man was unresponsive. He seemed about to fall asleep on Will's shoulder.

"Hey, don't go to sleep. You need to tell me which way. It's too dark to tell which way to go. Tell me which way."

The man let out a string of instructions in exasperation, none of which Will could understand.

"I can't understand you. Just point the way to me. Point."

Will pointed down the alley next to them and the old man nodded and pointed also down the same alley.

"This is the right way? The way to your house?"

The man pointed again, "Si, si."

It seemed odd the random direction he had pointed was the right way to go, but Will acquiesced and started walking them both in that direction.

They came to a large mud puddle and before noticing walked right into it. The water came halfway up Will's ankle. He cursed at the water's coldness. The old man had no reaction at all, just sloshed his feet through the muck.

The houses down here were a little nicer, a little cleaner than the ones above. The alley stretched wide into a smooth dirt path and their way became easier to navigate.

Here there were more people outside, standing in the cold. Next to one place was a large barrel with a fire inside, a crowd stood around it warming their hands, laughing with one another. But when they saw Will and the old man approach they grew quiet and eyed them both with suspicion. Will anyway. One of them spoke to the old man in Spanish. The old man laughed. Will wondered what they had said to one another but when he made eye contact with the man he looked away, disgusted.

Then the old man stopped in his place. He looked around in confusion, shaking his head.

"What is it? Are we in the right place? Are we here?"

The old man pointed back the way they came, past the group warming their hands in the barrel of fire.

"Well, why didn't you say. Do you know the way? Maybe we can ask those people? Do you know them?"

He knew it was useless to ask such questions to the old man, in English, but he felt like he had to articulate something, to feel like he was doing something. The old man did not answer.

They turned and went back in the direction they had come, this time when passing the group beside the fire, Will walked them over and tried to communicate.

"Hola, donde casa de hombre?" He said, pointing to the old man.

The man who spoke earlier lifted his hands from the fire and eyed Will with menace. He spoke very slowly in Spanish that Will could not make out. Will reached out in both directions.

"Donde casa?"

A few of the others pointed up the road, to the left of where they were standing, a little back alley.

"Gracias," Will nodded to them all, "Muchas gracias."

They did not respond, but only returned to the fire, their faces glowing in the evening darkness. 

Will guided the old man up the alleyway in the hope he would recognize the area soon and lead him to the right place. It was a narrow and dimly lit corridor, barely enough room for them both to walk side by side. They passed houses with candlelights inside, saw shadows inside moving, families, children, heard them laughing, playing, fighting, eating dinner.

Soon the old man stopped in his tracks and faced one of the homes, a poorly decorated shack among the others, small with a tiny wooden particle board for the door. On the door was the word Hermosa and the number 56.

"Are we here?"

The old man nodded. Will reached out and knocked on the door. There was no answer so he knocked again and this time the door flew open, nearly hitting them both.

A man emerged, middle-aged, unkempt beard, eyes glazed over from alcohol or something stronger. He came out in a rage, but as soon as he saw the old man his expression softened. He was silent and hugged the old man tightly with one hand. In the other he held a cigarette extended. They embraced for nearly half a minute, and then the man's eyes opened and spotted Will there and grew hard. He released his father and went over to Will. He spoke in a rough voice, asking some question Will did not understand.

"I brought him here. He said he needed to visit his son in San Bernardo, so I brought him."

The man did not move or speak anymore. He seemed in shock that Will spoke English. Finally he said, "Estados Unidos?"

"Si," Will answered, "I am from the United States."

Immediately the man broke into a smile, his arms opened and he embraced Will much as he had the old man.

"Estados Unidos!" he repeated, then with difficulty, "Welcome to Chile!"

"Gracias," Will answered, pulling away from the man.

The man turned and poked his head back into the house, shouting something Will did not know, except for Gringo and Estados Unidos. A few seconds later, more men emerged from the house, eyeing first the old man and then Will. They could not seem to put the two together. Will wanted to explain but didn't have the vocabulary. He hoped the old man would step in to explain, but he said nothing, strangely. The son turned to Will, put his arm around his shoulder and gestured for him to come inside. Will wanted to tell them he had to get back to the Hotel Riveria, but couldn't. They all went inside.


Nine

Their home consisted of one room, subdivided into different areas by crates and boards. The place was illuminated from a mechanic's lamp which hung from the low particle board ceiling. The bulb inside was not diffuse so the light was very harsh in the middle, then dropped off sharply into shadows. There was the den, where they entered, a small bedroom area which was a mattress and egg crate nightstand, and what Will assumed was the bathroom, a small area with a five gallon bucket covered by a toilet seat. On the ground next to it was a pile of newspapers. 

The son showed Will into the den and gestured for him to have a seat on the couch. Then he turned to his father and walked him over to a strange wheelbarrow like contraption in the corner. It was basically a wooden crate with the sides sheared down sat upon a frame with two bicycle wheels. There was a blanket which the old man tucked himself into. He looked contented and sat there in silence.

It was cold inside, but not so bad once the others came inside and the door was closed. They took seats beside Will, some on the couch next to him, others on crates. They all ignored him for the most part and talked in Spanish with one another. On a small table in front of him game was on the radio. To appear at ease he pretended to listen to the game, although it was obvious he had no idea what was going on.

The son approached Will and howled with laughter which did not seem to fit the mood, "Estados Unidos, welcome to Chile!"

The others all took up the same forced laughter and leaned in closer to him. Will expected the old man to tell the story of how they took the trip from downtown but he was not paying attention, off in his own world in the corner. Just then in his ear one of the men whispered in a gravely voice, 

"Macbook Pro. iPod Nano. iPhone color white."

He turned to face the man and when he did the man stared at him with reddened, jaundiced eyes and repeated as if he were carrying on a conversation, "Windows Vista. Norton Security Antivirus. Facebook Members Profile."

Will looked at the man in horror and felt his heartbeat rising. He composed himself, gave the man a small smile of recognition and rose from his seat. The act of standing up seemed somehow like a threatening move to the group, who were all sitting down. They too stood up and faced Will.

"It was nice to meet you all, and I'm glad I could help your father get back here, sir, but its late and I really have to be going. Muchas Gracias."

The son approached Will slowly with his hands held out in a gesture of friendship. He shook his hand and then turned to the group of others who took their seats again. Will started for the door, but the son put out his arm, blocking him. Once more he showed Will the couch seat.

"Sir," Will began, "Thank you for your hospitality. Muchas Gracias." He clasped two hands together in a gesture of gratitude, "But I have to go now. I have to catch the bus."

The son pointed outside and then broke into something Will took to be a plea or warning. He shook his head several times in the negative, as if saying it would be a bad idea to go out there now. The others all nodded in agreement that he should not leave. So once again Will took a seat on the couch.

Some kind of smell, like beef stew, had been filling the room the entire time, and now it was very strong. The son walked over to a pot in the corner, resting on a small skillet underneath some embers. He lifted the pot lid and smoke bellowed from it. He wafted the smoke away with the lid, scooping a spoonful of stew out of the pot and tasting it. Then he reared his head back and howled.

The others rose to their feet and rushed the stew pot. They fought and punched one another over bowls and spoons until at last the son erupted in an angry shout. That quieted them and from there they each took their turn having their bowl ladled with the stew. After the men took their seats again and began slurping down the stew, the son delicately prepared a cup and brought it over to his father, who had fallen asleep. He slapped his father gently and set the cup down beside him. The father awoke as if from a bad dream and when he saw the food he scooped it with both hands and drank it down, the juices spilling from the corners of his mouth.

Will was hungry, but did not want their food, but did feel strange he was not offered anything, as if that might portend something sinister. He could not shake a feeling of ill-intent, although no one had yet done anything.

But then the son brought Will over a steaming bowl of the soup. Will accepted it with both hands, but since it was hot he immediately set it down onto his lap.

"Gracias, muchas gracias."

When all the bowls were empty and even Will had drank his portion, the son rose and stood in the middle of the room, directly underneath the mechanic's lamp. He began speaking in a low voice, in Spanish, as if telling a story. The men around him had been nodding off, but looked up and fixed their attention on him. Will tried to understand from the hand gestured, inflections, pauses, what the story meant, but he was baffled. 

The story began with a series of quiet sentences, told matter of fact. Then suddenly, the son stopped, made a huge gesture with both arms, as if opening two doors, and shouted something in anger. All the others laughed to themselves, nodding. The father in the corner was also listening. Then the son began speaking faster and faster, and became more and more excited, until one point he grew very quiet and all the others became quiet as well. It was captivating to listen to a story from only gestures and tone. There seemed many different stories he could be telling. The son slowly turned his left hand into a gun and acted like he was creeping down a hallway, looking around a corner. 

Then, Will understood the story. The Spanish language melted away and he understood the story was about a man and a woman and another man. This was the man with the gun. The woman was his wife and the man she was with was her lover. He had discovered their affair and was going to confront them.

The son raised the gun and in a wide motion shot all over the room wildly. Will imagined the husband taking revenge on the lover and his wife, leaving nobody in the place alive. It was a grim story, but then everyone else started laughing uncontrollably, even the son. Even his father in the corner. Clearly it had not been a story about infidelity. But what then? What was so funny about murder?

Will joined in the laughter and when the others caught him laughing they stopped, acting as if his laughter was entirely inappropriate. Will was so confused he didn't know what to do. The son in particular had a grimace on his face. He walked away to the pot and brought back a mug and handed it to Will, motioning for him to drink.

Will smelled the contents of the mug. It was urine. He set the mug down hard onto the floor and stood up. The others stood up too. The son approached Will in a series of quick steps and paused just as he reached him. He shouted, pointing to the mug, commanding Will to drink. The others joined in. Everyone was laughing without smiles on their faces. They were deadly serious. Will looked over to the corner, to find the old man, and the old man was there, laughing. Again the son shouted at Will, in a more angry voice than before. He picked up the mug and shoved it into Will's hand. 

He took the mug and stared at it for a few moments. He then tossed the mug in the son's face and darted in the direction of the door. He crashed into the door, breaking it into pieces and found himself outside in the alleyway. He scrambled to his feet and ran in the direction he knew, back towards the larger road. Behind him he heard the shouts from the son and others and pushed his legs harder and harder to go as fast as he could. There was a lot of noise and from the corner of his vision he saw a blur of shanty dwellers eyes peering out.

All was dark, all he could saw was the line separating the ground from the shacks, and up ahead lights in windows. He heard them following behind. His thoughts all refocused on the present moment, on getting him out of there by any means necessary. When he came to a cross road, he split off to the left, hoping to split once more to confuse his pursuers. There at the end of the alleyway was the barrel of fire, the same group standing there as if nothing had changed, which for them it hadn't. He thought it best to avoid them since they had no loyalty to a gringo for sure. He continued down until he came to another turn and went left again. Now the alley was darker than ever, with no lights. He passed someone sitting on a step but said nothing. His breathing was panicked and shallow. His heart pounded. He stopped running and found a small collection of fifty gallon drums, tied together. But there was a space behind them and he squeezed in there and got down on his hands and knees.

From here he could see down the alleyway, between the barrels, which gave him a small advantage. He took a few deep breaths and listened closely. There were shouts and shuffles coming from somewhere. It seemed far off, but it could be the next alley over for all he knew. 

Then he heard a howl, but unlike an animal. The son. He was close. His back leg muscle cramped up and without thinking his leg extended to ease the pain but hit one of the barrels and the boom echoed off the walls. Then all was silent. No shouts, no howls or footsteps. Nothing.

After a minute of that quiet, it became too much for him and he took off in the same direction he had entered, deciding to make it back up the wooden steps and track his way out the way he came. Otherwise he was bound to get lost in this maze-like village. He ran with all his strength towards the main alleyway. He figured perhaps if there were people around and they found him, they could not hurt him too much.

When he reached the large alleyway there was nobody around, not even the group around the barrel of fire. The flames were now unattended, lapping the wind with the same intensity as before. But, this did give him something to go on. He quickly reoriented himself and remembered carrying the old man past the barrel on the left, so he went off in that direction as fast as he could. Soon he reached the large puddle and stomped right through it this time without stopping, but his foot sank into the mud and his left shoe came off. He muttered Fuck Fuck Fuck, man, but did not stop to retrieve it. For now the wet sock on his left foot did not slow him down and he kept on, but his gate was slightly off as he reached the steps going up.

Will had never climbed a set of stairs as fast in his life. He could not hear anything coming for him now, but that did nothing to make him feel at ease. He kept climbing, the smell of that raw sewage drain beneath him, beneath the steps. And then a crack and his left foot slipped between the broken board into the sewage and a large dagger of wood pierced his ankle and leg. Will let out of a cry of pain. He felt the warm blood rushing out into the cold liquid sewage. With both hands he brought out his leg and placed it on the broken step, and then with all his strength he pulled the dagger out of his leg. In the darkness he saw the blood pour from the wound.

He cried tears and tried to keep silent, but the pain was unbearable each time he moved his leg. He took off his sweater and undershirt, feeling the cold night's air on his bare chest. Then he tied the shirt tightly around his wound and then put back on the sweater. By then he was shivering and goosebumps had risen on his arms and the wounded flesh. He could not walk these steps now, but he climbed the remainder on his hands and dragged the hurt leg behind him. If he didn't place too much weight on it the pain was manageable.

At the top of the stairs were the men chasing him, looking down from on high. Will saw them, lit from behind, from a string of Christmas lights. The son leaned down and got in his face, speaking evil to him in Spanish. Then he punched him hard in the jaw and Will blacked out momentarily. In the meantime they reached into his pockets and took his wallet and cell phone, everything he had of value. Will came to and tried to get away but one of the others kicked him in the gut and stepped on his arm.

"Help me," was all he could say. He felt the ridiculousness of his words in the situation but that was all that came from his mouth, in his current state, "Help, please."

He looked up again and the men were gone. There was no one around to help him. In the darkness of the night there he saw the stars overhead and seeing them in that place and time made him think of home and gave him a feeling of hope. 

He thought of Constanza and how far he was now from seeing her. It seemed like another time, centuries ago, he could have met her there, at The Clinic. They could have ordered coffee, two of them, in tiny cups on the table. She would have been not as pretty as the photo, but pretty in a different way, plainer but more natural, with bright eyes and a full smile. They would talk about how strange it was, meeting online, how unnatural, how you never know until you meet if there will be that electricity, that spark of understanding, that understanding of meeting your soul's counterpart. He already loved her, although he would never say that, not so soon. But he loved her and was angry and furious that she lied, but he understood. Life was a lonely place with hostility all around you. There was no place to hide from the hostility. No sanctuary at all except for those brief moments of time when you found a connection in another person. That was home.

The pain welled up into a sharp bolt that went through his body and made him cry out. He tightened the shirt around the wound, but broke the coagulation and another stream of blood came down onto his bare foot.

"Help me," he repeated several more times. There was nobody there, "I need help."

Crawling he made it to a small bench, where he lifted himself up and lay down upon it. His arm was buzzing from the lack of sedative in his system. He was tired and cold but had no money or phone. How was he going to get back to the Hotel Riviera. It felt like a million miles away. And then he broke down. The stress of the events of the previous night and tonight was too much. He whimpered and sobbed into his hands. Everything good in this world seemed a million miles away from here. There was nothing good here. He longed for that feeling again, for clean innocent laughter and joy. Others had found it, his friends and family had all found love and happiness. Only he was alone, until he met Constanza and she was alone too. And together they were not alone. It sounded stupid but not from a certain perspective. Not from here.

Will rose to his feet and found he could drag his wounded leg behind him, like a cripple, and make ground. He kept close to the walls of the shacks and leaned against them for support. There were a few nails in the wood and they stuck him but compared with his other wound they were nothing. He kept going and soon reached the edge of the shanty town, where the fallen walls met a gated entrance, where he had entered with the old man on his arm a million years ago.

The streetlights were on and shone an amber light onto the dirt path. Will stayed to the side and kept walking, now using the wall for support. He knew by staying on the wall he would eventually come to the bus stop, and so now he refocused his mind on that, reaching the station. His footsteps were short and fog escaped from each rapid breath.

When he reached the bus stop there was nobody around. Will shoved off against the wall and made it over to the bench and collapsed onto it. The pain in his leg had become a dull throbbing which each heartbeat. A sign on a post next to the bench had times, but he found it very difficult to make out. Perhaps there were no more buses into the city tonight, the thought occurred to him. He needed to see a doctor, needed to take his medication. If only he could find someone to help him. What is the word for hospital, medico?

With all the strength in his arms he pushed himself onto his one good leg and hobbled over to the wall again. Once there, he shuffled further down, looking for some sign of a business or anything really. The streets were lit with dim streetlights, beyond the bus stop there appeared to be a large park, outlines of trees and bushes against the sky, utter darkness there. He shuffled down to an intersection and looked up and down it. A red and green sign rose over the buildings and signs, a gas station. It was perhaps a mile away, tiny in the distance, and he was out of wall.

Will stumbled across the street and made it to the street sign, where he held on for a minute, then picked himself up and began the mile-long hike to the gas station at the end of the road. There were some cars down there, maybe someone could take him back to the hotel. His wallet was gone, passport gone, phone gone. At least if he got back to the Riviera he could get his brother to wire him some cash. He had a ticket for the trip back. He just had to be smart. Don't get into any more situations like before. Don't be stupid. Be smart.

Talking to himself in that way made him forget the pain in his leg, and the buzzing in his arm, and the dizziness in his head. He wondered how much a man really could take before he just gave up hope. It would feel nice to lay down and rest for awhile. That wasn't giving up hope, that was taking care of yourself. Yet behind the voice that told him to stop and rest (on the ground?) was another voice, smaller, telling him to keep going. There was something like fear in this voice.

It was then he noticed that while talking to himself he had wondered from the sidewalk onto the grass. Immediately he drug himself back to the left to find the concrete pathway again, but it was not there. He increased his pace as much as his injury would allow, but all around him now was darkness, grass at his feet, the sound of wind blowing through brush. He stopped and looked around and saw nothing, no streetlights, no signs, no road. He tried to stay calm and gather his thoughts. What could have happened. Perhaps he was more disoriented than he thought and had been caught in his thoughts longer than he thought. But even so, which way would lead him back to the road. If this was the park then he must have wondered to his left, so by going right again that should take him back where he could find some landmark.

Will veered more to the right and kept going. He got frustrated and went even more to the right, at what he thought was a right angle to his previous course. No further, but if he were right then that was the fastest way to get him back on course. Slowly his eyes were becoming accustomed to the darkness around him. He made out shapes of trees more clearly, saw them as dark gray shadows at the edge of the path he was now on. At his feet he saw the grass patches. In the sky it was clear and starry, but there was no moon to help guide him.

He kept expecting to see the familiar streetlights and the road down to the gas station. It couldn't be much further now, but it did not come. Now he had been walking longer than he had even been on this road. Before he stopped again to change directions he ran squarely into a patch of briars. Their barbs scratched both arms as he struggled to get out of there. His good leg was wrapped up in one and suffered a few scratches as well.

"Fucking hell. Where the fuck am I?"

He punched the air a few times out of frustration and then felt his way around the briar bush. There were trees in front of him. He had reached the edge of a wood. He looked into it, saw a narrow path and decided to enter. His rational self protested, but at the current moment he was frustrated and impatient, in pain, and felt like he needed to keep moving. Maybe on the other side of these trees he could see something. Maybe they were just in the way. 

He entered and immediately saw there was a light source just beyond the woods, something large, a warehouse or something similar. The light increased the further in he went. The light was a muted red orange and allowed him to find his way better. In fact it was strange he had not seen anything from outside the wood, so bright it was. His head spun as his eyes became accustomed to the light and had to make sense of the dense limbs and brush all around him. It was thick, yet passable. He wound through the woods, approaching the light source, but it remained seductively out of reach. The ground at his feet turned into soft clay, then mud, but there was no immediate source of water. It was hard to walk through the mud with his leg but he did anyway.

Around a small bend he came to an open place, where the trail widened and there was a small pond there surrounded by dry leaves. The light reflected from the murky water. Will approached the pond with curiosity. It seemed odd. The pond wasn't a puddle from a rainstorm, but it also wasn't some man-made thing either. It seemed to well up from the Earth. The water was milky and he had a feeling it went down a long way. It gave him a sensation of vertigo and he had to sit down beside it. Here was a good of resting place as any. He retied the bandage around his leg, lay against a pile of leaves and closed his eyes. Immediately he fell asleep.

When he awoke it was still nighttime, the light source still there in the distance. He did not feel rested and felt he had only slept half an hour, maybe more. He turned to the pond and immediately kicked himself back a few feet, tossing leaves into the air. He picked up a long branch on the ground. There, in the middle of the pond, something was floating upside down. At first glance it looked like an overgrown fetus, with pale, nearly translucent skin. Veins throughout its body originated from its head area and pulsed slowly in the rhythm of a heartbeat.

After the initial horror, Will felt pity for it, floating there, exposed to the winter air, the overhanging branches. It looked pitiful, vulnerable, even melancholy. He wanted to protect it and looked around the woods for anything that might harm it. Forgotten were his wounds and withdrawals from his medication. All that seemed to matter was protecting this lifeform in the pond. But there was nobody there. No people. No animals.

He sat down beside the pond again, his eyes fixed on the life form. Was it really there? He wondered. Where was he? Things he felt like he should be questioning rose to his mind but were immediately silenced by a small voice inside. He picked up the branch and traced a circle outside the fetus, as if demarcating a line not to cross. Then he sat there in silence, in contemplation of the thing.

But then a thought occurred to him. He wondered if it were really alive? How was it breathing? He saw no air bubbles, no gills around its head. If he touched it lightly on the head, maybe it would show if it were alive, maybe move around, something. He put the thought out of his mind, but it kept creeping back in. 

"You will touch it," the small voice inside him whispered.

"If I touch it, it will die."

He reached out to the middle of the pond and placed his hand gently around the head of the fetus, only for a second, then brought his hand away. The flesh was cold, like a frog, but it did not react to his touch.

Then it sank into the murky deep of the pond, and was gone forever. He felt a deep shame and wept into his hands.

Time passed and the air became colder and the light beyond the treeline brighter. It was almost growing. A gentle wind came through the woods, rustling the leaves, causing a few to fall onto his shoulders and into the pond. He sat in silence and without moving, for how long it was hard to tell.

He felt a hand on his shoulder and turned to see Constanza standing there looking down at him. Immediately he rose to meet her face to face and they each hesitated before talking over one another.

"What are you doing here? I thought you were not the person in the photo and I left the Juan Valdez and so much happened that I don't know where to start."

Constanza said, "I was here the whole time, waiting for you."

She laughed. Will was embarrassed. Just then a leaf fell onto Constanza's shoulder and Will instinctively brushed it away, coming closer to her.

"Maybe we can get coffee now, do you know any place we could go? There's so much I want to tell you," Will could not keep up with his thoughts. "When you know someone on the Internet it doesn't feel real sometimes, but now that you're here in front of me, I know it was you. I just know."

"It's true," she said, "Let's go this way. I know a Juan Valdez this way a bit further down."

"Good," Will said, "I will follow you."

Constanza took Will by the hand and led him down another narrow winding path, in the direction of the pale light. He watched her walking from behind, her beautiful long hair whipping from side to side, her delicate shoulders exposed like in her picture. It was her. Will felt like a boy, filled with a hope and anticipation of the future he had not felt since he was a boy. The things they would experience together, the two of them, hand in hand. Everything seemed to be theirs, the entire world theirs. 

Her hand was delicate and warmly stroked his fingers as they walked. She looked back with a shy, knowing smile. He smiled back at her. Some never find that one person who can share that smile. That smile that shows you are both in on the same joke. He had found her, though.

As they approached another bend, her dress got caught on the briars and Will jumped down and removed them one by one. She thanked him and they continued, the light brighter and brighter.

"Are we close?" Will said.

The woods ended and before them was a construction site of some kind, the soil dug up in large muddy hills around an enormous pit. There was wood and debris. Constanza navigated around it like she had traveled this way before, and led them down a muddy makeshift set of steps. As they walked down into the pit he gazed across it and could not quite make out the other side. There was a fog. There were old cars sticking out of the ground, excavated, rusted. The impression was something like a garden of ancient automobiles. But there were people too, all swaying to some music he did not hear. People he recognized, Ben from the Fulbrights at California Cantina, the pony-tailed man from the riots in Plaza Italia, even the one-legged father from San Bernardo, all there, standing in front of an orb at the center of the pit, the source of the light he realized, spinning, shining, enormous in mass, not unlike the sun.

One by one people walked into the incandescence, their flesh burning up instantly. He watched them each without a care for their personal well-being walk directly into the hot center.

Constanza gripped his hand more tightly than before as they entered the plain of cars, surrounded by people dancing to the music. Then the music came to him and he felt the rhythm of it and soon he and Constanza were dancing together, embraced. He kissed her.

"What is happening?" Will asked.

"Do not be afraid," she reassured him, feathering his hair with her hand, "it has always been like this."

"Always?"

"Yes."

"I am afraid."

"There is nothing to be afraid of."

Constanza pulled away and led him closer to the flames in the center of the pit. Their feet sloshed through mud an inch thick. He could barely make progress through it, but continued on, sensing how excited she was. He held her hand tighter. Finally she stopped and turned to him, very close they held one another.

"It is time for you to go."

"Why?" he asked.

"It just is."

"Oh," he replied, "but I don't want to leave. We only just met."

"We will never be apart."

"You are a gift to me, a gift from God."

He took one last look at her and let go. She let her gaze drop and did not meet his anymore. She was crying. He took a look at the others waiting for their turn. They seemed happy, anxious. Then he turned and faced the burning orb, shining into his eyes, blinding him. Even so, he continued into the center of it, not hesitating, not looking back. He heard the song and recognized its melody, lovely music. As he entered the orb his body began to burn in front of his eyes. The flesh of his hands and arms and torso and legs melted away in front of his eyes.

The flames consumed him and he rose in the vapor over the pit, the valley, woods, park, San Bernardo, until he was over the city of Santiago, a spirit overlooking the city. He saw the lights of the buildings and the roads and in the distance saw the surrounding Andes, their snowcapped peaks protecting the boundaries of the city like an angel of Heaven.

From up here he felt a objectless love, some infinite thing beyond whatever feelings he had experienced before. The feeling he felt melted into the skyline of Santiago. At once he wanted to see the faces of the people walking its streets and hiding inside its buildings and with a thought made it so. He saw them all, smiling, crying, laughing. They had beliefs and desires and guilts and pleasures. He watched them enjoy their pleasures and felt pity, watched their guilts and felt the same. How beautiful they were, the people of Santiago.

Soaring over the night sky, he felt a freedom that expressed itself in flight. He could go anywhere, feel anything he wanted. Where was she? The girl he had fallen in love with. She was not here. He looked everywhere, scoured buildings and alleys, the metro and government buildings.

The darkness of the night and the stars and the silhouette of the Andes against the old buildings of the city, the dogs running, sleeping, he saw all these things. Then he came down, returning to San Bernardo, the shantytown, the pedestrian streets, and found the body there. Laying there, prone to the weather, the freezing temperature, ice and cold. The grass around him covered in frost.

As the sun rose he watched the man, the body of the man, hurt and alone. He dove into the world again, reckless and abandoning all of the things he had been shown. He returned.

There he was, collapsed onto the park grounds, a bleeding wound on his leg, robbed of all his Earthly possessions. Why return to this sad state of existence? The man, suffering, slept a sleep with no rest. He thought about Constanza and the memory of their togetherness and how good that was, for however long it lasted. Their love, call it what it was. Why are we afraid of the word love. Why not break the bonds of this flesh and live according to our hearts. The man who suffers, there in the park in San Bernardo. The sun rising, light coming over the mountains and shining onto his bleeding wounds.

"Heal his wounds," a voice spoke to him from beyond the trees, where it was still dark, where the briars, limbs, and weeds obscured the path through.


Ten

Will lay on the grass in the park, curled into himself for warmth, still asleep. Fog everywhere. There was a dog there, at his feet, licking blood from his exposed ankle. He awoke from his dream and immediately felt the hot tongue lapping against his skin. With his good foot he kicked the dog in the face with all his strength. 

"Get!" He kicked again at the air, "Get, damn you!"

That movement caused a shearing pain in his hurt leg. He cried out and fell back onto the grass, his breath visible. For a moment he felt like he was still dreaming and closed his eyes. Then he rose and looked around. Nothing but fog and dry grass and in the distance the sound of cars going by.

Gently he pulled up his jeans around the wound. It was still fresh, with slivers of wood in there. He picked them out at which point the blood ran fresh. He sopped at the blood with the makeshift tourniquet from the night before, now wet from dew. "It hurts. Goddamn it hurts." Will whispered to himself. His ribs were also sore, and his face, from the beating. But that was not everything. He also felt the tightness in his neck and chest, the familiar shallow breaths, the buzzing arm, withdrawals.

He tried to come up with a plan but his head was swimming with dizziness, foggy-headedness. After too much reasoning he felt weak and needed to close his eyes. Getting back to the Riviera was the thing to do, that much was obvious. There he could try to make contact with his brother, get him to wire him some money. Then, a doctor, something for the pain. Take his medication.

That dog was still there, even after he had kicked it in the face. It sat just where the fog began to obscure things, so he looked like a dark mass sitting there, watching him. But it did not look predatory and Will was not afraid of it. A big dog for sure, black coat, a labrador mix of some kind, wearing one of those tattered vests he had seen on other strays. But he was not afraid of it. Nor it of him.

"Which way, dog?" Will asked, his words slurred together. He didn't feel like he had the energy to articulate.

The dog's ears perked up at the sound of his voice, but it did not move.

"Towards the traffic you say? That seems like a good plan. People there at least. Not like here."

He rose up onto his good knee and pushed himself up with both hands against the ground. He let the bad leg drag loose, careful not to put any weight on it. When he was up he saw the dog had risen too, was there at his feet, tail wagging in expectation.

"I don't have any food. Go away."

He started off towards the traffic, unsure how far it was, couldn't be more than half a mile though, from the sound of it. He made way slowly but surely and now that he was moving the fog seemed to lift some. He could see further and further with every step, it seemed. He was in the park, a flat meadow, between the entrance where there was a playground and a big hill to his left, with a few small utility sheds.

The dog overtook him, circled back, and ran around his feet, at play. Will nearly tripped and cursed at the dog. He wished he had a stick to throw at it. But he didn't. So he tried to ignore it. At last it dawned on the dog that he was headed in a certain direction and from that point it began to lead him, as if guiding the way. Will was too delirious from his injuries and the withdrawals to much care. He kept going in that direction, following the sounds of traffic.

By now he could see fifty yards in front of him. He found the sidewalk he had lost in the night and the road leading into town. Once on the sidewalk there were things to hold onto, to help brace him, things to lean on. He found a telephone pole and rested for a few moments, breathing hard and heavy. The dog continued on ahead but stopped when he realized Will had stopped.

As he continued he began to follow the dog, unconsciously, and tried to keep pace with it, as if it were leading him somewhere. In general the dog was headed in the right direction, but in his state of mind he likely would have followed it right back off the path, into the woods. His mind drifted back to his nightmares and the violence of the night before. He felt lucky to be alive, but there was something oppressive about this place. It felt foreign in a way the rest of Santiago had not.

He looked around and saw they were in town, at least a more populated area. There were storefronts and a little traffic, some people. As he followed the dog he felt their eyes linger on him, his bad leg. He probably looked like hell, like somebody you don't want to get involved with. But the dog seemed to know where to go so he just followed behind and did not make any attempt to communicate with the people on the street.

The dog increased its pace when they turned a corner at the red light. Will wasn't even sure it knew he was back there anymore. But he kept following. Was it crazy? He was not sure. It seemed like a crazy thing to do, and yet if it were really crazy he wouldn't be doing it, surely. Those were the kinds of thoughts going through his foggy mind. It took all his strength to balance on his one good leg, not to let the bad leg come down too hard on the pavement, and keep pace with the dog. It kept his attention off his immediate pain. It helped.

There was a small corner store, with a young kid spraying off the entryway. The dog saw the kid and ran underneath the spray of water. The boy gave it another good dousing. The dog stopped and shook it off. A man from inside yelled at the kid, who dropped the running hose and ran inside.

Will stood back and watched all of this. He was afraid to get too close to anybody, afraid of what he wasn't sure. Instead he leaned against the side of a building one block, behind an exposed column and rested. He watched the dog lapped up the water which ran from the hose on the ground. Then it sat upright in the entrance to the store and gazed inside, patient but in expectation. Soon he saw a hand reach out and toss a few scraps of meat. The dog ate them up quickly and yelped with excitement. Then it continued walking down the street.

He followed the dog a couple more blocks. It stopped at every crosswalk and did not go until other humans went, just like those in Providencia. As he walked the wound on his bad leg bothered him less and less. As long as he kept that black shape in his view and focused his attention on it, things were okay. He made sure it never saw him. Not that it was hard to fool a dog, but he tried to keep at least thirty or forty feet behind.

A few more turns and they passed in front of a large church, Catholic, with yellow stone walls and an iron gate out front. An old priest was out there, with a bucket and sponge. Someone had spray-painted a swastika and male genitalia on the left side of the building and he was scrubbing it off with great effort. The dog ran inside the gate and greeted the old man, who stopped what he was doing and petted the animal. The dog grew more and more excited and ran over to a small wooden door behind the priest. The priest walked over to the door, opened it, and pulled out a bowl with some scraps. Eagerly the dog ate those up too, and then jumped onto the priest's frock, staining it with mud. The priest looked agitated and pushed the dog down, patting it on the head and closing the door, returning to his work. The dog once more went on his way down the street.

They came to a row of large buildings with wide alleys in between and the dog disappeared down one of these alleys. It was only then Will seemed to come out of his momentary stupor and wonder to himself what was going on. He had no explanation, even for himself. He heard the echo of a bark and followed it into the alley.

The alley led to a small park tucked among a strip of storefronts. Nobody was there. It had a swingset and a little slide. Two benches side by side. A tree at the entrance by the street, next to the gated fence. A group of dogs were sleeping underneath the tree, huddled together for warmth. The dog sauntered to the sleeping and barked repeatedly until they awoke. Will kept back behind a column at the edge of the alleyway they had emerged from.

Two of the dogs came over and sniffed the dog and then walked to the trash can, sniffing it. The dog seemed most interested in a small collie still lying down. He went to the collie and sniffed around. The collie rose and sniffed it. They barked at one another, circling. The black dog ran around behind the collie and tried to mount it, but the collie backed away. The black dog stopped trying and walked around the park, ever so often turning to the collie, in expectation. Then it would approach from a sneaky angle and attempt the mount again. After two or three tries it was successful and they went at it for a minute and then it was over. The dog dismounted and the collie barked, then the dog walked away, out the gate, and down the sidewalk.

When the dog vanished around the corner Will emerged from his hiding spot and limped through the park, braced himself on the entrance pole, and followed in the direction the dog had gone.

It was hard to keep up, the dog had increased its pace and took off in a trot up the road. There were people on the sidewalk, going both directions, at a slower pace than in the city. Bracing himself against the line of businesses he followed behind the dog on those streets. He passed a coffee shop and looked inside at the counter display of pastries and doughnuts. His stomach caved in on itself in hunger. He had no money and no way to get money, or else he'd go in, get one of cake doughnuts, a mocha, and sponge up the mocha with the doughnut.

They came to an intersection where the traffic was heavy and the pedestrians crossed back and forth, blocking the cars. There were angry honks, shouts. Will had momentarily lost the dog while thinking about the doughnuts but found it again waiting by the intersection among a crowd of people.

The light changed and the crowd took off across the street, the dog too. Will came up to the intersection and watched him cross. From the corner of his eye he saw a red compact car darting around the side street onto the main road, oblivious to the state of the traffic signals, apparently. 

There was enough time. It was not that there was no time. He saw the car coming and the dog walking. Momentarily it occurred to him he could wave his arms to get the car to stop, or shout at the dog to get him out of the way. But it was not that. He watched only. Inside he pulled back and made a decision to only watch. And the car came at twenty-five maybe thirty and struck the dog in the side, the dog pushed under the passenger wheel. The car came to a stop in front of Will, traffic backing up behind. A woman in her sixties got out, went over to the dog and looked at it. She reached down and felt for a collar, but not finding one she looked around, got back in her car, and drove off.

The dog lay on its side, its hind twisted as if they were upright. Blood on its coat made it shine. The dog breathed in and then exhaled in two labored actions. It whimpered. It was trying to get off the road, inching along, in pain.

Will looked around and found a newspaper blowing on the ground under a bus stop bench. Unfolding the paper he made a little blanket wrap and reached down, and with some difficulty, slid it under the dog. It nipped at his arm but did not bite.

Backtracking through the alley, he found it easy to find his way back onto the main street where he had followed the dog, now suffering in his arms. He walked past the church but did not look to see if the priest was still there. The people he met on the road stayed well clear once they noticed his limp and the bruises on his face, and the dying dog in his arms, wrapped in newspaper. A mother pulled her two children across the street. A guy wearing headphones did a double take. He just kept going.

His head hurt and his leg was in constant pain. He looked down and saw the wound had opened again, there was a line of blood running into his sock. He wanted to stop but it felt important to him to get back to the park, so he ignored the pain and his foggy head.

Past the corner bodega which was open now, the entryway clean. The clerk at the register inside. As Will walked past the boy looked over and caught Will's eye. He seemed to recognized the dog, but then he turned away to a customer who walked up.

The heaviness started to get to him. It probably weighed twenty five pounds and his arms felt numb, stuck in outstretched position. He brought his arms in, brought the dog closer to his chest. Its breaths came more quickly now, more shallow. Its eyes were still opened as slits. When he tried to shift the weight further up his forearms it put pressure on the hind of the dog and it let out a tortured yelp.

They walked down the sidewalk, the same one they had come from this morning. But it was now clear. The sky overcast but no fog to obscure the view. A group of kids walking a few blocks down. Nobody else.

At last he came to the park area and looked across the field. There was the hill and the shed. He went over to where he thought he had woken up this morning and placed the dog on the ground. He sat beside it.

There was a wind blowing through the field. It chilled him and rustled the hair of the dog. He place his hand on the dog's head and gently stroked behind its ears. Its eyes closed and the breaths were so faint you could miss it if you weren't paying close attention.

Sometime later the wind stopped and the dog was no longer breathing. Will still stroked its head but then stopped and watched the dog. His vision was blurred and he couldn't think. His chest was tight. All he wanted to do was lay down and sleep. Even hear on the cold ground. Eventually he rose and walked over to the shed. The door was open so he looked inside and found a small garden spade, took it back with him.

Then he began to dig in the cold ground. At first it was tough to break the layer of grass but once he was through to soil it became easier, although not too easy. The soil was hard and he could only manage to break a small clump at each strike. He dug until his right hand hurt and then he switched hands. The pile of dirt had grown off to the side. He dug deep right off to make sure he wouldn't hit any soil that was too hard for the spade, maybe two feet deep. Then once he was deep enough he widened the hole. There were times he had to rest and he wiped his hands on his shirt and sat there in silence. A car went by and the people inside looked at him. He looked at them back and after they passed, kept digging. All in all, it took maybe an hour to make a hole large enough for the dog.

Once finished, he reached underneath the dog with both arms and lowered it into the hole. He started tossing the loose soil from the pile back into the hole, covering the dog, when he noticed the headline on the front page of the newspaper he had used as a blanket for the dog. There was blood and dirt on it, and the words were Spanish, but he distinctly recognized the name The Clinic and below that a large photograph of rubble and debris, fire. People scrambling out of frame. Firefighters spraying it down.

He dusted off the paper and took a closer look. The date on the paper was today, and through scanning the article text beside the photograph this had happened at 1400 on Mondata, yesterday. He tried the best he could to decipher the Spanish but it was difficult. He made out the words *terrorista* and in quotation marks, "Los Perros de Santiago." 

In a side panel he saw a series of head shots with names. The people listed were Americans and there at the bottom of the list Will saw his own face and name in caption below. Above them in bold letters, *víctimas*.


III.

Eleven

He sat alone at a plain desk with chairs on both sides. There was a pitcher of water on the table and a few glasses placed upside down. He poured a drink and looked at a generic painting of a springtime field with flowers. On the far wall was the folded wheelchair a male nurse had brought him in. "Where I am?" he had asked the nurse, "the United States Embassy, sir." the nurse replied, before checking his blood pressure and leaving the room. Any time before that Will could not remember. It was a blank. He felt a calmness he had not felt since arriving in Santiago. He had many  questions but at the moment felt content. He was comfortable in the silence and was startled when the door opened and a woman carrying a folder of files and a younger man entered the room. Someone outside pulled the door closed after they came inside.

The woman took a seat on the other side of the table, facing Will. The man stood at the door, his hands behind his back in a official pose. The woman put down her papers and looked at him with compassion.

"How are you feeling, Mr. S?"

"Fine," he answered, trying to feel out her agenda, "I feel fine."

"How is your wound? Are the stitches holding? The pain?"

He had not even thought about the wound. He reached down and felt the stitches beneath the pants he wore, a kind of hospital garb, thin cloth material. There as a numbness in the place where his wound was, a comfortable feeling.

"Thank you. I don't have any pain at the moment. The stitches are fine."

"Good." The woman said. Her face was kind, her expression was one of understanding, "William, my name is Catalina Guiterrez. I am with the Chilean government, the division closest to your FBI. Do you understand me?"

"I think so."

"I must inform you that you are under no obligation to speak to me today, under International Law. Mr. Barraza here is a representative of the embassy, here to ensure your international rights are upheld. What I can tell you is that you are under no suspicion of criminal activity. We only wish to interview you, in order to gather evidence against the offending parties. I need your agreement before we continue this conversation. So if you do agree, will you sign this document here. If you have questions you can ask, or you may ask Mr. Barraza."

She showed him a document, written in English. He glanced over to Mr. Barraza, who nodded at him. But he saw no reason not to talk, so he signed the document.

"Before we start, I'm sorry but I don't quite remember the circumstances that brought me here. Can you tell me how I came to be here? For my own peace of mind. I remember being wheeled in this morning, and a I remember a nurse, but before that everything is a blank. And why am I being held? I am confused about everything that's happened."

"Of course, Mr. S. I can tell you what I know."

She sifted through her papers and stopped on a particular document, reading.

"A police officer, Mr. Ruiz found you in the park in San Bernardo on Friday morning. It says you were semi-conscious and lying next to a hole with a dead dog inside. There was no identification on your person, but you were quickly recognized as one of the suspected victims of the bombing at The Clinic the day before. You had evidence of a recent beating and a fresh wound on your right leg. Consequently you were carried to the St. Martin's Hospital, where you were treated. Does any of this sound familiar, so far?"

"I remember the bombing. I mean, I remember that I saw the picture in the newspaper, my own picture. And I remember a dog, something about a dog."

"Do you remember how you came to the park? Where did the dog come from?"

"Vaguely," Will said, he closed his eyes, recounting the details which had brought him there, "I don't think I was in a good state of mind."

"That's okay, the doctor's said it might take some time for you to remember. We will come back to that. Once you were treated at the hospital the doctor's told us you needed some rest, so we put you up in a hotel room downtown for the evening, and this morning some hospital staff transported you here to the embassy, where we retrieved your identification information and cob berated other strands of the story."

"The story? I'm getting confused. What about the bombing? What about my picture in the paper."

The woman put out her hand onto his. She squeezed warmly.

"William, it's okay. We are going to explain everything, and maybe you can help us too. Everything is okay now. Do you need something to eat? I can have Mr. Barrazza bring in something."

He was hungry.

"Please."

Mr. Barrazza nodded and went out. When he was gone Ms. Guitterrez leaned in closer to him.

"I am truly sorry for the things you have gone through, Mr. S. I want you to know we notified your brother and mother this morning. They know you are safe. I spoke with your brother myself."

"Thank you," he said, somewhat surprised, "did he know what was going on? I didn't tell anybody I was coming here."

"He didn't, but the bombing made international news and we were afraid the news would get out before notifying next of kin."

"Thanks. That's very kind," Will said. He was quiet for a moment, "What about those others, the other Americans I saw in the paper?"

She looked back at the table and bit her lip. "Those were victims."

Will understood. At that point Mr. Barrazza came back with a tray of doughnuts of all varieties. Will nodded to him and took a doughnut and ate. He felt better almost immediately.

"Shall I get you some coffee, Mr. S?" Mr. Barrazza asked.

"No thank you," Will said, "water is fine."

"William, I would like to start from the beginning, if you think you can remember. The events that brought you to Chile in the first place," Catalina shifted through a few papers, "What can you tell me about Constanza?"

She pushed out an OkCupid profile page, the profile she originally wrote him from. He recognized the photo of Ana Tijoux in the upper corner.

"Oh my God, is Constanza okay? We were supposed to meet there. I had forgotten until just now. It was all happening then."

"At this time we suspect Constanza is one of many fake profiles created by the Dogs of Santiago terrorist group to lure Americans to Chile, in order to be victims of the bombings. I am sorry to have to tell you this."

He took in the information. Somehow he was not surpassed. It made sense. But a feeling of loneliness came over him.

"Who was Constanza then?"

"We don't know at this time. We have the email address the fake profiles were created from, but have not yet traced the origin. It takes time. What could help us is if you could explain the nature of your relationship."

"I feel like a fool. We talked about so many personal things. What is it even a female?"

"We don't know," Catalina looked sad, "William, it's okay. Internet impersonation happens all the time. You don't have anything to feel foolish about. It could have happened to anyone. Did Constanza contact you?"

"Yes, she winked at me. I saw she was from Santiago, but her photograph was so pretty, I figured what the heck and sent her a quick message, something flirtatious. I don't remember what."

"I am assuming you began to communicate through email after that."

"Not email, we instant messaged, first through the site, then off the site through Skype. If you want you can have all our message transcripts. I'm pretty sure they're still on my computer. Oh shit, my stuff. I need to go get my things."

"We retrieved your items from the Hotel Riviera yesterday. Please don't be worried. We brought them to your new hotel room. Your laptop is there."

"Thank you," Will said, relieved, "To reiterate, I want to help in any way I can. Do you think our conversations could be useful to the investigation?"

"Very likely, and thank you for your cooperation. Any detail could be helpful, its hard to say what that might be, a mention of a place, or an event, a name. What was the nature of your conversations?"

"The usual type of getting to know somebody. At first, light and flirtatious, compliments and what's your favorite food, music, stuff like that. I don't think I was taking it very seriously at first, because she was so far away. Just having fun."

"Did you discuss politics at all?"

"Yes, like I was saying, at first it was just fun things. Then we had a few late night conversations that went on for hours, until morning even. Jesus, who was this person I was talking to? I feel ashamed. To think they were laughing at me, lying to my face."

"What were the nature of your political discussions?"

"Well, she seemed very liberal, a lot of Marxist ideas, which is okay, I have a pretty progressive perspective myself. We talked about the role of government as a force for good, what happens when governments become corrupt."

"Revolution."

"Yes, we discussed revolution. It was her idea though that revolution is a cyclic event, the revolutionaries overthrow the corrupt, but then once they are in power, they become the corrupt, in an endless cycle throughout history."

"Did she seem bitter, or angry when discussing these topics? Did she mention anything specific to Chilean history or government?"

"Yeah, I know she talked about Pinochet, which was the only one I had heard of."

Catalina nodded, writing notes as they talked. A few times Will repeated what he said, clarified thoughts. As they talked it came back to him.

"Did you discuss capitalism versus communism, things like that?"

"Oh yes, a lot. In fact that was the centerpoint to most of our conversations around politics. She hated capitalism, kept referring to the coming downfall of capitalism, how it led to so much horror in the modern world. Things like that."

"Were you in agreement with her politics? I'm trying to get at possible motivations."

"To be honest I agreed with her most of the time. I thought she was a bit extreme in some cases, like I don't ever think violence is acceptable. I would bring up Gandhi and other forms of peaceful protest. She didn't seem into that. But we didn't disagree. I agreed with her that capitalism had fundamental problems, especially as practiced in the United States."

"So, I think I'm getting a good understanding of your relationship. At what point did the subject of your coming to Chile occur? Was it her idea?"

"No, well, not directly. Now that I think about it, she was pretty clever. She kept hinting how she had all this free time coming up, and how it would be fun if I came down, we could explore the city together. But she never outright asked me to come. But finally, I broached the subject and she was ecstatic and from that point she really wanted me to come at a certain time. It happened very quickly. I bought the ticket online and took off from work for a week, and left. Didn't tell anybody."

"Do you usually travel this way? Impromptu, no contact information."

"No, I never travel at all, especially out of the country. This was my first time out of the United States."

Will found it hard to maintain eye contact with Catalina. She looked at him with such pity and understanding, and spoke with such a tender, un-official tone.

"So you bought a ticket and flew down, the two of you were going to meet. Was your primary contact email at this time?"

"Yes, instant messaging and email, but while traveling we agreed to talk through email."

"Let's move forward and talk about after you arrived. Did you communicate through email when you arrived?"

"Yes, I told her what hotel I had booked, the Riveria, and we made plans to meet at a coffee shop not too far away, in Providencia, the Juan Valdez."

"Oh really?" She wrote more notes, "we had not heard this before."

"Is that helpful?"

"It was her decision to meet there?"

"Yes."

"Very helpful, in fact. Excuse me one moment. I should make a phone call."

Catalina left the room and Will had another doughnut. He felt very relaxed, and guessed the orderly must have given him something this morning. Soon she returned and apologized for the interruption.

"I promise this won't go on much further. I'd just like to get an overview of the events once you arrived in Santiago."

She paused to read through her notes.

"So, you arrived, you took a cab to the Hotel Riviera, you made email contact with Constanza. I am assuming you did not meet up that night. What happened?"

"I took the metro to Providencia and found the Juan Valdez. I was early so I went inside and ordered something. I brought flowers. Anyway, she was late and I was growing anxious. I have problems with anxiety. I'm on medication for it actually."

Catalina listened but did not react to his confession, so he continued.

"So I went down to the barista and asked him if he had seen her, I had a picture of her, from the profile. And the barista laughed and told me it was a Chilean celebrity."

"Ana Tijoux."

"Right, he brought up a page on the Internet with her picture and I was upset, angry, confused, a whole lot of feelings at once. So I left the place and started walking. I do that sometimes. It helps my anxiety."

"Where did you go? Did you attempt to contact her?"

"No, at that time I had no way to contact her. I just left."

"When was your next communication with Constanza?"

"I met some Americans at the California Cantina, and someone there let me use his phone, so I emailed her an angry message, asking who she really was, all that. I was still pretty angry."

Catalina was interested in learning about the Americans at the California Cantina, so Will told her about them, then about the walk to Plaza Italia with Ben, the mugging, and how he came to be involved in the protest by the Santiago Dogs. She was shocked to hear that and stopped writing notes.

"You were there at the protest in Plaza Italia on the night of the thirteenth?"

"Yeah, it was crazy."

"And you say you didn't realize you were a part of the protest?"

"No," Will made sure he explained himself very carefully. He realized how it sounded, "I was at the game, they set up the jumbotron across from the park and I was there. Then when the game ended there was a celebration and it got carried away and before I knew it I was surrounded by men in riot gear."

"And this had nothing to do with Constanza. She didn't tell you about the protest, anything like that?"

"No."

"Odd."

"I know how it sounds."

Catalina became quiet and leaned back in her chair. Then she sifted through another folder and took out a photograph.

"Do you recognize this person?"

It was the man with the ponytail, the one he followed onto the side streets, out of danger.

"I do. He was there. Who is he?"

"Felipe Boetsch, the leader of the Santiago Dogs. One of them anyway. He is the one who ordered the bombing at The Clinic."

"How do you know that? He told us. They took credit for the bombing. They released the names and photos of the victims. You among them, although they were wrong about you."

There was a minute of silence while he took in everything she was telling him.

"Will," she began, "let's skip to the next time you had contact with Constanza."

"Sure," Will said, "It was the next morning. I was hungover pretty bad. I had a lot of drinks. She wrote me back and asked if I wanted to meet at the Clinic."

"What was your reaction to that?"

"Skeptical, but curious. She apologized and said she would explain everything. To please meet her there at 1:30 and not to be late."

"But you did not go, why?"

"Well," Will stopped, as if remembering something, "I wanted to go. I planned to go. I ate breakfast, got dressed up, I even hailed a cab."

He paused. Catalina noticed his hesitation.

"So you were on your way. You got ready and hailed a cab, but something happened. Did you change your mind? How did you end up in San Bernardo the following day? Is this connected?"

"Yes," Will said, "I mean, I didn't change my mind. I had every intention of meeting her, but I felt like I needed to help this homeless man, this crippled old man outside the Riviera."

"What do you mean?"

"I had this sad feeling, a hopeless, darkness in my heart. All the things that had happened from the day before had left an evil feeling inside me, an unclean feeling. And when I saw that cripple there was a look on his face, a look like utter sorrow. I wanted to reach out to him, saw him from the cab as it was pulling away. I stopped the driver because I felt like if I helped that poor man it would cleanse those feelings my from heart. And so, that's what I did. I found out he wanted to visit his son in San Bernardo and I tried to pay his way but it was hopeless. He could not make it on his own. That became clear. But I couldn't back out of it. I knew I was going to be late to meet Constanza, but this felt more important than that. I don't know. Maybe I was still angry with her. But it wasn't that. It was so I could feel goodness again, feel that lightness in my heart again, like you feel when you are a kid."

Catalina had stopped writing down and watched him. Her eyes welled up as he spoke. She took his hand. Will felt the warmth of her hand wrap around his. He did not pull away. He did think it was a bit strange a government worker acting like this. He saw the cross on her necklace and understood.

Catalina let go and smiled at him. She composed herself once more and picked up her pad and pen, writing it down.

"So you missed your meeting with Constanza by traveling with this crippled man to San Bernardo. And it was this man's son who robbed you? Did you learn their names?"

Will remembered the name on the door, but didn't want to bring them into it. He wanted to forget San Bernardo and everything that had come from it. He told Catalina the rest of the events in San Bernardo and she wrote them all down. When he was finished she closed up the folder of papers and put back on her glasses.

"Will," she said, "Once again, on the behalf of Chile and its people, I want to apologize. Please do not think these terrorists represent us or our beliefs. We do not hate Americans. We love all people here."

"Thank you."

"We have put you up in a hotel downtown and have arranged temporary passport with the consulate to allow you to travel back to the United States. We also arranged for your flight. It leaves tomorrow at 15:30 and is nonstop to Atlanta."

"Thank you very much. That is kind."

"There will be follow-up questions at a later time, but there is no reason for you to remain in Chile. I'm sorry to have kept you for so long. We will arrange someone to take you back to your hotel. Do you have any questions for me?"

"No," Will said, "Thank you for your kindness and I will cooperate to the fullest extent that I am able."

They shook hands and then Catalina and Mr. Barraza left the room. It was only a few minutes later that a knock came on the door and a young woman said a car was waiting outside for him.

Twelve

By the time they arrived at the hotel it was raining. A steady pouring, a grey overcast, cold. The car pulled up to the entrance and a hotel valet opened the backseat door. The driver gave him a nod and drove off. Another valet opened the door to the hotel, which entered into a cavernous space, with marble columns and high chandeliers. The light inside was golden, muted, and gave everything a warm glow. Will approached the front desk, where several clerks waited for patrons. A pretty lady greeted him with a wave.

"Welcome back, Mr. S. They told me you would be arriving and that you may not remember your room number, or have your keys. I made backups for you. So here they are."

Impressed and amazed, he took the keycards and told her thank you. She nodded and went back to work.

Towards the entrance was a Starbucks and in the middle of the lobby was a cozy reading area, with couches and tables. There were many people there, businessmen, families, couples. Will took it all in and noticed the concierge's desk on the other side, next to a large fountain. He went over.

"Excuse me," Will asked the concierge, "do you speak English?"

"And Spanish, French, German, and Russian. How may I assist you on this glorious rainy day? Do you need recommendations for dinner, perhaps?"

"No, thank you," Will replied, pleased with the man's enthusiasm for his work, "I was wondering if you had a pool here."

"No, we do not have a pool. We have four of them."

The concierge smiled and then leaned over to inspect the bandages wrapped around his leg.

"I will tell you the best one for you, sir. On the roof we have an olympic-sized pool, salt water, heated this time of year. Indoors of course, with a skylight. Will do wonders for your injuries, to soak them."

"Thank you very much. That sounds perfect. On the roof you say. So just get in the elevator..."

"Correct. All the way up. Thirty seventh floor. Look for attractive ladies in bathing suits."

Will laughed, "Thank you. What else do people do around here, on rainy days?"

"Well, let me see," the concierge thought, "there is the movie theater across the street. That's very popular on days like this. American films, subtitled. In the evening there are some dance clubs. I can give you directions if you like."

"Where is the movie theater, do I take a taxi?"

"No sir, its just right across the street, in the downstairs plaza market."

"Thank you."

"Have a wonderful stay, sir." the concierge nodded, then walked to the next person at the desk.

He took the elevator to his room on the ninth floor. It was a cozy space, not very large, but nice, with a window that overlooked the street. The rain pattered against it. On the bed were his belongings, brought from the Riveria. His computer lay on the desk in the corner. There were some medications on the counter, with a note from the doctor written out. It told him to take one pill for the pain every few hours, if necessary.

He took one and found his shorts in the duffle. He stripped out of his jeans and sweatshirt and put on the shorts and a t-shirt. The clothes had been cleaned. They no longer smelled of smoke and all the evening smells from the first night. He found a large white towel in a closet and put on his flip flops.

The pool area was empty except for a young couple in the hot tub. The pool itself was empty and shimmered bright blue against the overcast light from outside. The rain beat against the skylight in a steady patter. He tossed the towel on a plastic lounge chair and dipped his toe in the pool. It was warm. He walked to the steps on the shallow end and slowly entered, ensuring the salt water would not sting his wounds, but it didn't. It felt nice, the warm water acted like a relaxant, or perhaps it was the pain medication taking effect, but he then floated upright in the pool, feeling a calmness he had not felt for a long time. He listened to the gentle sloshes of the water against his body and the patter of the rain and nearly fell asleep. Soon he heard some others enter the pool and looked up. It was the couple from the hot tub.

"Hola," Will said.

"Hola," the young man answered, "are you American?"

"Si, Estados Unidos."

They laughed.

"I like your beard," his girlfriend said.

"Thank you."

Will floated off again, listening to their intimate whispers. They laughed, probably about him, but he didn't care. He dipped his head under the water and brushed his hands through his hair.

He got out of the pool and napped in the lounge chair for a bit. A family arrived and the kids jumped into the pool and the father shouted at them. At some point he fell asleep, but did not dream and when he awoke it felt like it had only been a moment, but the pool area was now empty. The pool still. Outside the sky was dark, but the rain still beat on the glass overhead.

He went back to his room and checked the time, wrote a few emails. One to his brother, one to his mother, telling them he would return the next day, and would be in touch. Telling them he loved them. Afterwards he took a shower and washed off the salt. There were supplies to redress his wounds, so he wrapped up in clean bandages.

From there he went downstairs and across the street, into the movie theater, holding his sweater over his head to not get his hair wet. There as a lot of traffic, dense, and he weaved through. At the theater there were a few Hollywood blockbusters and some kids movies. In his current state of mind he didn't feel like anything heavy so got a ticket for Cars 2, bought a hot dog and coke, and went inside. He was in a good mood and enjoyed the movie more than he thought he would, so much so that he wondered if it was just the medication. The only others in the theater were a few mothers and their kids. Will laughed when the children laughed.

After the movie he went back to his room and lay on the bed, not really thinking about anything, just resting, when the phone rang.

"Hello?"

"Mr. S, is that you?" a voice came on the other end, a man's voice.

"Yes it is. May I ask who is calling?"

The man spoke very quickly and Will had a hard time understanding him, although he spoke English.

"Catalina, Ms. Guiterrez asked me to come. My name is Dr. Hernandez. She was thinking we could talk about a few things, if you were feeling up to it. I'm in the lobby of the hotel now, if you'd like to come down?"

Will found himself uneasy, and a little cautious, but agreed to come meet him at least.

"You say Ms. Guiterrez sent you?"

"That's right, just to talk. Off the record. Please don't be alarmed."

"Well, give me a few minutes. I'll meet you in front of the concierge's desk."

He went down to the lobby, spied out the concierge's desk from behind one of the pillars, and saw a short, older man with a long gray beard and a bald head, wearing an old-fashioned trench coat, dotted with rain. In his hand he held a folded umbrella and was checking something on his phone. He seemed genuine at least.

Will went over to the man and spoke before he was seen.

"Doctor Hernandez? Is that you?"

The man turned and looked surprised to see him.

"Ah, I did not expect you to make it down so quickly," He shook Will's hand and gazed down to his leg, "Tell me, how is your leg?"

"It's fine. I went for a swim in the salt water pool earlier. Then redressed the wound. But its fine."

"Good, that's good. My old friend, Doctor Milla, is the one who treated you. He does good work. I am glad to hear it. Tell me, have you had dinner by any chance? Because I have not, and I was thinking we could perhaps go talk over some good Peruvian food, what do you say?"

Will was not given much opportunity to speak or answer even. He began to agree to the idea, when the doctor spoke up again.

"It's not far, come, they have decent prices, although nothing this far into the city has great prices, all inflated from the tourists. But excellent food. Have you ever tried Peruvian?"

"No," Will said. By that point they were both walking out the side entrance. At which point the doctor opened his umbrella and walked them both down the street, ensuring Will was covered from the rain.

A few blocks down was a modern looking restaurant called Fresca written in colorful letters. They entered, were seated and brought menus. The place was very busy tonight. Will looked around at the patrons. A waiter came up and asked something in Spanish. Doctor Hernandez answered him and then addressed Will.

"What are you drinking tonight, Mr. S? The Pisco Sour is wonderful here."

"No alcohol for me. A Coke is fine. Do they have Coke?"

Doctor Hernandez ordered in Spanish and the waiter departed. The doctor pulled the napkin from the table and placed it on his shirt. His manners seemed from a different time. The way he spoke seemed from a different time. Will liked him.

A few minutes later the waiter brought a Pisco Sour for the doctor, and a Coke for Will. He also set down a basket of rolls and a bowl of pico de gallo and butter. They ordered. Fortunately the menu had pictures, and Will picked out a simple beef and vegetable stir fry with rice. It also came with a side of fries. The doctor ordered for them both and afterwards he looked at Will with kind, curious eyes.

"So Will," the doctor began, "Let me lay things out for you, because I'm sure you are confused by this point."

Will nodded, then reached over and took a roll from the basket, spreading a little pico on it. The doctor did the same.

"They sent me to talk to you this evening because you have been through some very traumatic events over the last few days. I am a psychiatrist, employed by Corfo. I also have my own practice in Los Condes. I received my doctorate in Psychiatry from Yale in 1978. Also, that is where I learned to speak English. Now, Ms. Guiterrez gave me a file which detailed your events of the last couple of days and I have read it over and I would like to know what you are feeling, what are your thoughts about the events of the last few days? Are you angry? Afraid? Ambivalent? Please be honest."

"To be perfectly honest I have tried not to think about things. It was all so overwhelming, and the conversation I had with Catalina this morning disturbed me. I am afraid. And there is some anger in there too. I am not ambivalent. When I try to understand things I get confused. What gets me the most is still the hostility directed at me from complete strangers, the people in the group, the Santiago Dogs."

The doctor nodded.

"Beside the pool this afternoon I was napping and as I drifted between being awake and asleep this question kept repeating itself," Will stopped as if hearing the question in his head, and then repeated it out loud, "Do I live an evil life?"

The question hung in the air. The doctor did not respond to it. He only listened, and a few moments later Will went on.

"An evil life by which I mean to explain the hatred strangers from halfway across the world would have against me on a *personal* level. Is it a life of privilege and luxury they don't have access to? Is it opportunities I have because of my nationality or my race? Luxuries I enjoy by injustices committed against those I cannot see, am not even aware of. And the answer, I think, is yes. In that respect I do live an evil life. Me, as an individual. Not by malice or violence or hatred, but by a kind of conscious ignorance I have to achieve to not see the daily injustices that provides me with my life, as I live it; The abundance of cheap food farmed by immigrant workers who labor in the hot sun so I can stroll down the grocery store whenever I like to pick up a load of bread, stylish clothing put together in warehouses by children dressed in rags, electronic gadgets produced in enormous factories where people are the machinery, pushed to their limit to meet a quota because Will must have his shiny new iPhone and not one day late!"

The waiter came with their dishes and set them down. Will was quiet but began to eat. The doctor took a bite as well, and still did not respond. The food was good, fresh, simple. Will had not had a meal like this his whole trip and scarfed it down.

"Anyway, those are the thoughts that I have been thinking and the feelings I have been feeling. Is that what you wanted to know?"

The doctor pondered for a moment before replying.

"I can understand your feelings. You spoke the truth and I admire your dedication to honesty. Perhaps you don't want to think about it this clinical way, but you are empathizing with those who meant you harm, trying to see things from their perspective, in order to make sense out of the chaos and that is all completely normal for someone who has been in your position. You are not incorrect that as an American you live a life of privilege compared to millions of people in the world. And what goes along with privilege is a kind of inherent ignorance, an expectation that your experience represents the way things are, or the way things ought to be. There are many subtleties and viewpoints that make it more complicated, but what it comes down to always is that there are those who have and those who do not have, and those who have feel things should continue as they are and those who do not have feel things should change."

"What do you think?" Will asked.

"I think the world is perfect in its imperfection, and that human systems are always in need of change. And I do think those who live in privilege should become conscious that what they feel entitled to often comes at the expense and hardship of someone else. So I think your guilt on that subject is justified and right. But here is what I don't think. I do not think one should attempt to change a system through violence. Never. I think those who do such things have lost their way. Capitalism, socialism, all these systems are imperfect and they should be rethought on a regular basis. Is this working? Is this working at the expense of others? And if not, change things. The biggest problem people have is not having faith in others. They see the eternal potential for growth and change in themselves, but not in others. Once a capitalist, always a capitalist. Once a murderer, always a murderer."

"Sometimes I wish I lived in the old days. Everything now is so connected. How can I live a righteous life in society when everything I come in contact with has been tainted at some point by the corruption, the exploitation, greed, violence, pollution? How do I live in this world? Is the answer to drop out of society? To live as a hermit in order to save my own soul? Somehow that does not feel right. There is something selfish about that. So is the answer to live in society but doing good. Do I give to the poor? If so, at what point do I stop giving? At what point do I decide, I will help you over here and I will help you over there, but you I can't help because I've already helped those others. Do I keep just enough to keep me alive? Is that what life is?"

"What then? Do I zone out like so many of my friends, become numb to the problems of life and go through life like an automaton, doing just what is expected of me, going to work each morning, getting married, having children, saving up for retirement, not breaking any laws."

"For a long time I've wondered what do I know about life, myself? What do I know that is not a product of my culture or my parent's belief systems, traditions, ethics? What do I know that is not an idea borrowed from a book I read, or a film, or a piece of music? What do *I* know with my own to eyes and my own two hands, about life? I can think of very few things, a handful of things. I wish I could break away from those influences and see the world naked and cultivate my knowledge from a raw state. Because who has the truth. Everybody it seems like. This book over here has all the answers, some say. No, listen to me another says, and I will show you the way. Nobody ever admits they don't know. You never see a book with a title, "I don't know what the fuck I'm doing here, and so can you!"

"Do you feel like you want to escape life?"

"I want reality and pure experience. I feel like I can't get away from how others want me to live, from expectations. I want a connection with someone that is real."

"I read one time that evolution has given every living thing some kind of advantage in the system, something specific in their physical makeup. But for human beings, we don't have anything in our physical makeup that is advantageous. We are something like an amorphous shape, but what we do have is our mind. That is what we were given by evolution or God or whatever you believe put us here. If that is true, then it is what we create with our minds is the providence of our being here, how can technology be wrong, inherently? There are so many people who want to see us return back to a simpler time. I feel like that is wrong. I think we should question what we do with our technology, but to call technology itself a sin is to deny that which God or whatever has given us."

"Will, I don't have the answers to these questions. Nobody really does," the doctor said, "There are experts and gurus and prophets and philosophers, but I think at the end of the day your conscience is the only voice worth listening to. On the one hand I can tell you from experience that these are good questions to ask, but it can easily paralyze you into inaction or frustration or slowly it can turn into self-righteousness, which will lead to the hatred of others, possibly violence. I have seen it happen."

Will was quiet, but continued eating. The doctor ordered another Pisco Sour.

"Let us bring the conversation around to something more practical. I would like to discuss your history with anxiety and depression, if you don't mind. You mention anxiety in your discussions with Catalina and there were traces of benzodiazines and sleeping pills from the bloodwork that was run while you were in the hospital."

"I have a history of anxiety. A couple years ago I had a kind of breakdown, although I wasn't sure what it was at the time, I thought maybe I was dying. I went to the emergency room. I couldn't sleep. My heart raced. After they determined I wasn't dying they sent me to a psychiatrist who put me on Lexapro and Xanax and Ambien. And it worked, but I didn't feel like a person anymore. I felt disconnected from reality. I became obsessed with my condition and withdrew."

"Are you still on this medication?"

"I take Xanax as needed and Ambien as needed, but I am weaning myself off. In fact, I had not used these drugs for about a month until I came down here. Then I needed them. I felt the old feelings and I couldn't handle it."

"Why did you stop taking the Lexapro?"

"Because, I don't want to live my life through the filter of a drug. I want my life to be a real life. I became dependent on Xanax. The doctor had me taking three pills a day, for almost a year, and one day I realized the drug wasn't calming me, it was making me anxious. I found about about tolerance and how you can start to withdrawal from Xanax hours after you take it. So I had to stop all of them. I felt like they were poisoning me. The psychiatrist I was seeing did not agree with me, so I left him and weaned off the Lexapro on my own. I studied alternative forms of treatment, natural herbs, meditation, talk treatment."

"Were those effective for you?"

"A little, the talking more than anything else."

"Would you say you are okay now?"

"Not really, not after this whole experience. There were moments I can't comprehend really, what was going on. I feel I still suffer from depression, anxiety, and perhaps some self-destructive behavior. I don't know what to call it. But I know I want off those pills. I don't want to be on pills. I want my life to be my own."

"I would like to say a few words about the medications, because I sense your hostility and even sense a feeling of betrayal on the part of your psychiatrist."

"A bit, yes, I think you're right."

"What you have to understand is that medicine of today did not just spring out of the ground, it is something which has evolved, from the primitive superstitions, to the traditional remedies, to science-based discoveries, it is all connected, in a line through history. And, for a moment, I want you to ask yourself the question, where does medicine as an idea come from? Why do human beings perform medicine and the animals do not? In that regard, why do we practice medicine, from a social perspective?"

"I don't know. I'm not sure I understand your question."

"Perhaps I'm not explaining myself well, but what I want you to recognize is that the origin of medicine is empathy for our fellow man. It grew from seeing others suffer from maladies and injuries and feeling a need to help that one who suffered. It is an act of love. The sufferer was not the one trying to cure himself. No, it was his neighbor. So, for that reason I would not toss out medicine just like that."

"But the chemicals they use, they can be harmful. You don't know what they might do to your body or mind. It is better to use natural medication if possible."

"I hate to break this to you, Will but there are many, many poisons in nature which will not hesitate to kill you in a heartbeat. That is no argument for nature-based medicine. Here is the thing. We do the best we can. We act on the knowledge we have, imperfect as that is. What we thought we knew hundreds of years ago, we later realized was ineffective, or there was perhaps a better way. It is a technology. It improves. Now, that is not to say nature-based medicine is backwards or ineffective. Most definitely not. I sometimes prescribe holistic treatments. Because some do work. However, some do not. The key here is to remain open and have humility. And to resist dogma, on both sides. The medicines you say you don't want to take have helped millions of people make it through the day. It is not perfect. There are issues and side effects, and sometimes there are serious complications. And there are large businesses involved in pharmaceuticals who let the lust for money get in the way of progress, become corrupt. Those things are all real, Will, and you should be conscious of them. But what I don't want to see is you rage blindly against the wrong thing."

"Do not lose hope, my friend. Do not harden your heart against the world. Have faith in people. Look for the best in them and do what you can to help them in their journey through this life, but also be willing to receive their help with gratitude. Do not be swallowed up by greed or anger or self-righteousness. There will always be the poor, the injured, and the abused. Do not fall into despair. Do not place the weight of that upon your shoulders. Listen to your own conscience above any outside influence, above any book or guru. Be humble and try to take no more resources than you need. Yet, enjoy the gifts of this world. They have been given to you. Believe in that, my friend. It is all a gift, the beautiful and the ugly in life, the good and the evil. It is all a gift, made precious by the fact that it will not last forever. This is what I want to say to you."

Will looked at the table and contemplated the things the doctor had said. He did not reply. He felt it would be rude to do so. Instead he let the words linger in the space between them. He finished his dinner. The doctor finished his plate and called the waiter, speaking to him in Spanish. A few minutes later the waiter brought out two plates, dessert, and set it down in front of them. A moist white cake covered with a deep red glaze.

"Tres Leches, the best in Santiago. You have to try at least a bite, my friend."

"It looks good," Will said. He forked a piece into his mouth and was surprised that it was chilled, a sweet cream soaked through the cake, and the glaze was a tart raspberry.

"It's wonderful," Will said.

The doctor laughed and they both finished the dessert in silence. Afterwards the doctor paid the bill and walked with Will back to the hotel. By then the rain had stopped and the sidewalk glistened with the lights from the storefronts and bars. It was cold and the traffic was thin. The stars were visible in the night sky.

They said goodbye at the doors of the hotel. The doctor's handshake was firm. Will watched him walk down the street and hail a cab and then he was gone. The doorman opened the doors of the hotel and he went inside.

Thirteen

He woke at ten. He stretched and yawned, feeling well-rested of the first time in days. He went to the window overlooking the street below. He watched the people walking, the traffic going by. It was a clear day, high clouds, blue sky. The smog had been washed away by the rain so you could see the Andes clear on the horizon, the snowy peaks. The morning sunlight fell on the buildings in the distance, shining off the windows.

His leg was in pain so he took one of the pain pills. He thought to take a Xanax but put it off, for now. After a shower and shave he put on the clothes which had been cleaned for him and checked his email, although there was nothing new. For a brief moment he saw the old emails from Constanza but ignored them, closed his laptop and packed it into his duffle bag.

The phone rang and the lady at the desk informed him there was a car arriving within the hour to carry him the airport and asked if he needed anything before leaving. He thanked her and said no, that he would be down in a few minutes to checkout.

He made a quick sweep of the room, picked up his bag, and went downstairs. The same woman from the day before greeted him at the desk, asked how his stay was, all that. He told her it was fine and then walked over to the concierge. The concierge greeted him with a familiar smile.

"A car will be arriving within the hour to take me to the airport. Is it okay if I leave my bags here while I go out for some lunch?"

"Of course, sir," I will inform the valets to place your bags in the back, then when your car arrives they can get them for you."

"Perfect, thank you," Will said, "On that subject, do you know a good place to get a simple lunch, like a sandwich, nearby?"

"Ronaldo's Bakery, just around the block. They bake their bread fresh daily and sell wonderful sandwiches at lunchtime. You will beat the crowd if you go there now."

"Gracias," Will said.

"De nada, senior."

After leaving his bags with the valet manager, Will walked around the block, mingled in with the constant crowd which seemed to walk these streets. The air was not as cold as it had been, warm even when the sun beat down on your neck. He admired the tall buildings as he walked around the corner, where the skyscrapers blocked off the sun. Instantly it became cooler, but still pleasant. 

Finally he arrived at Ronaldo's, a tiny place he would have missed if not for the directions. There was no sign but it had to be the place. The smell of freshly baked bread filled the street and in the window fresh cuts of meat were on display. He went inside and saw the special of the day written on a small chalkboard on the counter, Cuban Sandwich for 2500 pesos. He ordered that and a bottled Coke and waited until it was ready. There were a few benches inside but he decided to walk around a bit more, find someplace outside to eat.

He continued down the same street and came to a wide intersection, crossed over, and saw a large park in the distance. He kept walking down the sidewalk parallel to the park until he saw a hole in the traffic and crossed over the street. There were trees and grass and a dirt trail that both encircled the park and wound through it. He opened the Coke and took a drink, admiring the day, the people. 

Some were jogging, some pushing strollers, some businesspeople on lunch break waving their hands.

The park extended down three blocks and Will kept walking the dirt path, hoping it would circle back and take him where he had come from. Finally he came to the end and recognized where he was. Across another large intersection he saw Plaza Italia, the familiar statue there, the Baquedano metro entrance. He turned to reorient himself to how he had approached the park on the night of the riots. Then he noticed the river on the other side of the park, a bridge. There were students walking the bridge and street vendors with various goods spread out. He thought to get some last-minute souvenirs but didn't.

He kept walking around the park, until he came around the other side. There he passed an enormous bronze statue of a sailing ship. Once around the other side he was on a wide dirt path and could see all the way down to the other end. On horseback were two police officers patrolling. There was not much shade where he walked and it was warm, comfortable. Joggers passed him on both sides, a guy on an old rusty bicycle.

One block down he came to an open field in the middle of the park, with gently rolling hills and trees, and where it ended a brightly colored playground. He found a bench which overlooked everything and sat to eat his lunch. The sandwich was still hot. The fresh bread made all the difference. It melted into the cheese on top and was airy and light. Although very hungry he ate it slow in order to savor each bite.

On a blanket in the middle of the field was a young couple, both wearing black, the girl lay on top of him, her dark hair draped over his chest. They each looked into the other's eyes and held one another as close as possible. Will remembered back to a time he had been that close to another person. It was a very long time ago.

There was another group of young people, a class of some kind taking photographs. They posed in several ways, laughing and piling on top of each other. A girl standing on the path directed them with more seriousness than them. She was frustrated but smiled again once she got the shot she was looking for.

Along the outside, facing the path were a series of busts of famous people. Will recognized the one closest to him, Abraham Lincoln. It took him a moment to recognize who it was because someone had spray-painted his beard pink. He thought to take a photo of it with the camera on his phone, but didn't.

But most of the activity was centered around the playground. There were probably thirty or so little ones climbing and jumping and running around. Their mothers sat on benches nearby, shouting from time to time, gossiping to one another. A few dads too. Will watched the children for a long time, until he finished his sandwich and Coke. He imagined this was the first time in awhile they had a chance to get outside and play, and it showed. They were full of energy, yelling and laughing without a thought for anything else.

Down the path he saw a street vendor pushing a cart with a placard that read Nutz for Nutz, so he got up and went over there, got a bag of candied almonds for 500 pesos and returned to the bench. They were sweet and buttered. He popped them into his mouth a few at at time until the bag was empty. Then he downed the rest of the Coke and sat there, full and a little sleepy.

His attention returned to the children at the playground. One boy in particular caught his attention, a young boy perhaps four years old, with long thin blonde hair, pale skin, and blue overalls and a green shirt. He was running up to everyone and high fiving them, laughing, and then running off to the next person as if it were the funniest thing in the world. He ran to all the mothers and in turn high fived them, interrupting their conversations. They each smiled and returned his high five. Then he ran over to a woman sitting on a blanket on the grass, probably his mother, a young woman who sat him on her lap and blew his nose. He scrambled to get away and immediately ran up to a man in a suit and coat talking seriously into his cell phone. The boy raised his hand high and stood in front of the man who smiled and slapped his hand. He went up to all the people on blankets and they all gave him high fives. But he didn't come as far as Will was. His mother shouted after him when he got too far away but otherwise didn't seem too concerned. She read a book placed between her legs.

At this point the boy became bored of the high five game and ran over to his mother, who gave him an apple to eat, which he did with relish. Once finished he handed the core to his mother, and picked up a red ball from a tote bag, and then kicked it excitedly across the grass. Then he ran after it. The ball rolled over to the couple in black who were making out. The girl looked at the ball, picked it up, and hurled it away. The boy corrected course and followed the ball under a big tree, where a couple of stray dogs were asleep.

When the boy noticed them he stopped where he was, reluctant to get too close to them. But the ball was right there between them and finally his desire got the better of him and he got the courage to walk over and get the ball. So he did, with small and careful steps, but when he leaned over he accidentally brushed up against the smaller of the two dogs, a black labrador mix and it raised its head and wagged its tail against the ground.

The boy dropped the ball and stared back at the dog, frozen in fear. He then slowly put out his hand, which the dog sniffed and then rose to its feet, nearly as tall as the boy. The boy reached out to pet the dog on its head and down the length of its body. The dog stood there, allowing him, his head down, tongue wagging. Then, the boy darted off in a sprint away from the dog and the dog took a stance of apprehension. Once the boy was about ten feet away he turned again and called the dog over to him. The dog immediately took off and ran over to the boy, knocking him down. The boy laughed and kicked his feet and ran over to get the ball. 

He threw the ball over to his mother and the dog followed the ball and tried to wrap his mouth around it, but it was too large. The mother noticed the dog, fished in the tote, and threw it a few slices of deli meat from her bag, which the dog immediately ate up and stood waiting for more. Then she threw the ball back over to the boy, who was waiting for the dog to return it. The dog took off in a happy lope over to the boy, who had leaned over to pick up the ball, knocked into him again and they both fell over, end over end. The boy rolled until he was on his feet again and then wrapped his arms around the dog's neck in a loving embrace, his happy face telling of the gratitude he was feeling in that moment. 

Such gratitude that the Earth existed and he existed and therefore he could take part in it. He was grateful for the sun shining onto his face and for the soft grass under his feet and for the stray dog who gnawed at his ball with bared teeth. He was grateful for his mother on the blanket and for the open book on her lap, and for the strangers who gave him enthusiastic high fives when he ran up to them. For the peanut butter and jelly sandwich in the tote and the juice box also. He was grateful for shade under the trees and the wavy playground slide, even the bronze statue of Abraham Lincoln with a pink beard. For the old apartment buildings high above and the art museum down the block. For the kids playing hide and seek and the joggers with headphones working up a sweat. For the bustle of the foot traffic in the square and even the obnoxious honking of the cars going by. For the two lovers wearing all black who existed only for the other. For the impatient photographer and her students. For the hot dog vendor and the aroma from his cart that made everybody hungry. For the boy. He was grateful for all of these things. 

So grateful.
