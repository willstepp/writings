The Dogs of Santiago Notes:

* The opposite of the pretentious is the *real*
* Wallow in the senses
* Do not shy away from the shadow
* Insignificant words, sentences, paragraphs, scenes, chapters leading to an ineffable significance
* Create a narrative pull so the story *moves*
* Nothing easy for him, ordeals piling on top of ordeals
* No memories or stories apart from dialogue
* Dreams happen as a matter of sequence, indistinguishable from reality
* A book is a deed, not a product
* "You are 37. It's your eyes. Your face is young, but there is a weariness in your eyes."
* No bon-mots, no clever turns-of-phrase
* Shower in the dark
* Trying to buy flowers, clerk shows him flour
* Don't hold anything back, ideas, emotions
* An artist whose art is silence, "The plague of our time is the proliferation of mass communication, so he has created a new artistic movement - *shutthefuckupism*. The only relevant theme an artist needs to communicate to this new world order is silence, our innate need for silence and contemplation, at more than any other time in history. So he's taken a vow of silence. He's on all the social media sites, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, SnapChat. You should follow him."
* Ending: Interview with Government Agent (female), discussion with psychiatrist, hotel room, restaurant, park - the beautiful surroundings, lying under the treetops, sunlight through the leaves, dogs sleeping in the sun, a feeling of sublime gratitude at being alive, unspoken but unmistaken.
* Sees someone he thinks is Ben, does not recognize him.
* Transparent words, sentences, paragraphs, scenes, chapters. Not so bad they stand out; Not so good they stand out.

Daily Notes:

What is purpose of Fullbright scholar scene:

1) Establish Perros de Santiago, fringe political group
2) Establish anti-establishment thought process of MC
3) Start escalating drunken night (shots, pot, xanax)
4) Introduce Ben, who will act as his Virgil for the night, "You are on fire tonight!"

"El gato encima d una mesa!"

The conversation drifts to the Santiago Dogs, privilege, the importance of action.

Plaza Italia. Comes to an open area with a gigantic screen. They are showing a football game, Chile vs Brazil. There he joins in the excitement, trying to follow the game, getting angry when the crowd gets angry, shouting when the crowd shouts.

He walks back to his hotel room, foregoes the metro, and eventually arrives. By then it is 19:30 and the sun is going down. He goes to his room, stands in the silence of it, but finds it unbearable.

3300
1700 words in the conversation, regarding TBD

5000 (game + riot)
1700 mugging
1700 game
1700 riot

5000 (bellavista + valpon 9 + hotel)

Something happens to Will and Ben on the way, just a holdup with a knife, no beating, Ben's wallet is stolen. Will's Xanax is stolen, but they don't find his wallet. 

Then later, in the shanty town, its just a beating, but they take his wallet as well, break his ribs and wrist.

Will ends up beating someone during the riot

Floating in space, clinging to a rock, speeding up, then realizes there is no need to cling anymore. No consumption, no empathy, only silence. A planet for every girl and boy.

"Of the wise man, as of the foolish man, there is no memory for ever..." Ecclesiastes.

Ben shits his pants during the mugging. "I shit my pants. Fuck. I shit them."

"iPod. iPod. iPod. iPod. iPod!"
Network! Macbook Pro! Macbook Macbook Pro one thousand sixty inch display!"

"All they said was iPod and they took my phone and wallet."

What is the purpose of the scene tonight? To give a sense of the excitement, pride, and joyous ecstasy of watching a national soccer game, and how it slowly gets out of control. Drinking, punching but laughing, dancing, hot dogs, completes, uno cerveza por favor! Draw from the jumbotron night, the gate, the maze like nature of the crowd, the violence mixed with happiness. the confusion about the game. The girls. The clear night above it all. A family like an island. A boy on his father's shoulders. A businessman in a suit eating ice cream. Bring back the anxiety of being in a crowd, of feeling the pressure on the chest, the slight suffocation.

What happens now? 12-03-2013

The riots should span two writing sessions ~3000 words, and end with Will beaten, soaking wet, falling into the river from the bridge, walking down with the direction of the water, seeing people's clothes strung over the water, drying. Climbs out a few hundred miles down, walking the narrow alleys, until he emerges somewhere close to Bellavista. Disorientation, vivid detail, images without context, violence mixed with laughing.

Beginning of the riots, chaos, celebration turning into a stampede, up close to the carabineros. They push people to the ground. tear gas in the air. The dogs playing as if its just another day. Will gets away and runs down a side street with a pack of teenagers. There are people looking out the windows.

Will is in the crowd, celebrating the Chilean victory, although violence is creeping in, slowly. He feels swept along, picks up a chair himself and tosses it into a tree. Someone hands him a beer, there are shouts and songs. He joins in and screams about the cat on the table, having fun.

How can I live in this world. You know how it says in the Bible, give to those that asketh thee and from he who would borrow from thee turn not thou away, how can you do that? Suppose I give a man a dollar, then another man comes up...ad infinitum. Am I supposed to give everything I have. If not, where do you draw the line in the sand and say no more from me?

Am I evil? Am I living an evil life? Is that why they want to murder me? What do I really know? What is imprinted by my culture, my religion, my parents, friends? What do *I* know, myself? Not much.

Why did you follow the man with the ponytail back to the Plaza? Did you have a chance to get away?

Yes.

Why didn't you?

I don't know.

The interrogation is a confession

What happens now? 12-04-2013

Will is in the middle of the riots. He has escaped the Plaza by running down some side streets with some of the other protesters. The people were covering their faces with their shirts, trying not to breathe it in. The man in the ponytail begins shouting and leads the group back to the Plaza, where they encounter dozens of carabineros in riot gear, armor, batons, face shields. They throw things they pick up off the ground at them, shout things. Will joins in without really understanding. A carabinero grabs him by the arm and pushes hi to the ground. Will swings and knocks him down, starts punching underneath the face shield. Then runs off, frightened. He cannot see in front of him from the smoke, all the lights in the square have been turned off. He can hear the riot vans careening down side streets, the blast of the cannons. He stumbles off away from the chaos and falls from the bank leading down to a shallow river. The water is ice cold and he wades in it for a few hundred yards, then climbs up the bank on the other side. The streets are quiet here, the wind through the alleys, his heart beat, far away lights, the night sky, and the sound of music.

What happens now? 12-05-2013

Will is there in the river. He climbs out, becomes confused which direction is Moneda, hears music so he heads that way. Comes to a place with traditional female dancers in a square, playing to guitar. People are looking at him. He walks into a tacqueria bathroom and fixes his hair, removes his soaken shirt. As he walks out a man asks if he is from the United States? He says yes, and the man says, you must come with me, very seriously. Everyone is drunk. Nobody seems aware that just half a mile down the road are riots and fires. In the distance he hears sirens. The man leads him past a long line of dressed up people, into an old warehouse building, Galpon 9. The man hands him a drink ticket and says, welcome to Chile. Shows him inside. He enters the club, a hopping place, girls in short skirts, makeup, men dressed to the nines, a dance floor packed with people. 

What happens now? 12-06-2013

Will decides to order another drink to fit into the crowd, blend in. A girl starts talking to him, then a man, the girl says he is her boyfriend but she no longer likes him. the man does not speak english, she barely does. the man nods, will feels weird, but asks her if she wants to dance. He agrees. When they are finished dancing they have trouble communicating. She is an English teacher for little kids. 

What happens now? 12-07-2013

Will excuses himself to go to the bathroom. When he returns to Margarita is talking to Rosa so Will stands there, unsure what to do. Eventually Felipe comes up and sits down next to her. They don't acknowledge him again. Will walks down to the dance floor and starts to dance alone. Another woman starts dancing with him, she is wearing a sheer, glittered skirt and dress, slightly frizzy hair, thinner. They start making out and Will asks if she wants to get out of there. They walk and decide to take a cab to Hotel Riviera. They walk in the lobby, its dark, take the elevator up.

What happens now? 12-08-2013

They have immediate sex, but she insists he pays her, they do and the condom breaks inside her. He panics and she washes herself and leaves Will alone. Will takes an Ambien and cannot sleep, hallucinates. Will has hallucinations, regrets sleeping with the whore, has a dream about his father. What's it like to be a father. Wonderful.

What happens now? 12-16-2013

Will wakes up sore and hungry. Goes downstairs to the cafe and orders an espresso and some pastries. Takes it to his room. Checks his email. There is a message from Constanza apologizing. She says to come to the The Clinic at 1330 for lunch and she will explain everything. Will looks up The Clinic on his laptop, takes a shower, gets dressed. He goes downstairs but just as he is about to hail a cab he notices the old man from the day before, collecting money. He is carrying a sign. Will wonders what the sign says. 


What happens now? 12-17-2013

He gets in the cab, and as the cab stops he stops the driver. He walks over to the man and asks him what the sign says. Asks if he needs money? Gives him some change. Then he stops a passerby and asks what the sign says. "Must visit my son. San Bernardo." The man is missing leg so needs help walking. He has bad arthritis and his hands are curled up. Cannot see well. He asks someone else the best way to get to San Bernardo from here. Take the bus at the corner. Only couple thousand pesos. He walks the man to the nearest bus stop and tries to pay for a fare, but it only takes exact change. He remembers the Bip! card he bought at the Subway, gets it out. There he plans to pay for the man to get on the bus, but the man nearly collapses when he walks away. Will goes back and walks him to a seat on the crowded bus. Then the door pulls closed and the bus drives off. Will shouts but the driver does not listen. He sits with the old man on the route to San Bernardo.

What happens now? 12-27-2013

Open Sewage
Smell of Garbage
Houses made of scraps, wood, tin, plastic sheets
Crowded
No Electricity, candlelight
milk crates for furniture
pads for bedding
Dirt floors
rust
loose electric wires for makeshift light fixtures
rickety steps
sounds of sex, children crying, a violent argument

Will and the old man enter the shanty town and get lost. The sun is dropping and makes finding the old man's home hard. Will gets tired of holding the man and has to rest. They sit down. Will is feeling anxious, he needs to get back to the Hotel Riveria to take another Xanax. At last, by accident they find the house and enter. The man's son is there with a group of friends. They crowd around Will like a pack of dogs. The son is not happy to see the old man. He pushes him down in the corner. The idea I think is the old father is in town collecting money which the son takes from him.

What happens now? 12-28-2013

Inside the shanty, the son puts his father into a wheelbarrow type contraption in the corner, which allows him to wheel around the place, although for the time being he seems content to just sit in the corner. The place is a dump, there is one ratty couch and some crates, a mattress in the corner, and a small room with a shit bucket. The place is lit with a mechanic's hanging light. Will tries to leave, but the man forces him to sit with them. He is telling a story, a violent story in Spanish. Will observes in horror as the story is told, it seems the story of a murder. His anxiety increases and he gets up to leave, but once again the man stops him. Then he gives him something to drink. It is a cup of piss. Will spits it out, but the man forces him to drink it. All of them are laughing, including the old man in the corner. He runs out.

What happens now? 12-29-2013

The son of the old man and his group of friends chase will through the Shantytown. Will falls through the steps and a sliver of wood goes into his leg. He steps in the open shit sewer. Then they overtake him, rob him of his wallet and cell phone, stabbing him in the gut as he tries to get away. The entire time they are laughing. They leave him and he comes upon the barrel of people before but they ignore him so he walks off.


What happens now? 12-30-2013

A delirium sets in, brought on by his injuries, the shock of the violence, exhaustion, and withdrawals from his sedatives. He begins to have visions of strange things. A fetus floating in a deep pool, which recoils and sinks when he touches it

What happens now? 1-3-2013

Constanza appears to him, a beautiful woman. They talk and then walk into the  valley of mud. people are there, chanting and dancing, throwing themselves into the hot sun at the center, everyone is there, ben, the ponytailed man, he dances with Constanza, until they try to thrown him in as well, then they do and the flames consume him. he watches his flesh burn and rise up over the city and then soars over the skyline, coming down onto a hurt man, the voice in him says, "Heal his wounds."

What happens now? 1-7-2013

As Will awakes from his dream, he finds a stray dog licking the wound on his leg clean. He fights the dog away and watches it. His mind is cloudy, he can tell he is having withdrawals and pain. There is a mist in the air, he can't tell where he is. The dog wanders off, and Will in his disoriented state follows it.


What happens now? 1-9-2013

Will follows the dog into the alley and it comes out in a little park where some fellow dogs are sleeping. The dogs greets them and starts humping one of the females. They finish and the dog continues down the road once more, Will not too far behind. They come to a busy intersection. The dog walks into the street and Will sees a car coming but does not call out, does nothing at all, although there is time. The car hits the dog, an woman in her sixties gets out, looks at the dog, gets back in her car and drives off. Will goes over to the dog, which is still alive, but breathing heavily, whimpering, in pain. Will picks up a newspaper lying on the ground and uses it has a blanket with which to pick up the dog safely with both arms. Then he limps it back towards the park. The dog growls and nips at his hand but is soon too weak to fight back. Passersby eye Will with suspicion, avoiding walking too close to him and the dog. At last they get to the park. By now the sun has burned off the fog, he can see clearly up he hill to the shantytown where he came from the other night. Will is growing more and more foggy headed, his head hurts with a sharp pain, the wounded leg has gone numb, the wound broken out again and bleeding down into his shoe. He walks to the shed and grabs a small garden tool lying there. He rests the dog on the newspapers and starts digging a hole in which to bury the dog. He digs for a long time, deep and wide enough for the dog. No one comes around. When finished he picks up the dog, who has now died and places him into the hole. As he begins to shovel dirt into the grave he sees the headline on the front page of the newspaper, and a picture. An explosion at The Clinic, he makes out. A bomb terrorist. Dogs of Santiago. And there in a caption is a gallery of photos and names, all American. Will is one.




What do I myself know? Almost nothing.

Am I living an evil life? How can we live in this world, everything we do or touch has been tainted by corruption, exploitation, greed, violence, pollution, in some capacity. How do I live? Do I drop out of society, become a hermit? What am I supposed to do? I give to the poor, the majority of the time. But then what if someone asks me to give just after I've given something to someone else, and I think 'I just gave to that other man, if I give to this person, do I give to the next, until I am out of all my money? What then?' Am I wrong to think about those things? I have been judged. Someone out there decided I was not worthy of life. But the execution failed. That anger is still there. I can feel it.

Do I give into anger and attack those who are my oppressors? Let myself become numb and automaton-like. Do I drop out of society? I like people. God gave us brains with which to develop tools, then how can technology be inherently evil. At what point do we stop? So many people have all the answers. This person over here. This person over there. Except they don't. How can you live anymore. How can I live in this world?

Why did you get out of the cab and escort that man to San Bernardo?

Something evil and unclean had depressed my soul, was suffocating it. Maybe it was the drugs, my mood, the riots, sleeping with the prostitute. I felt a sadness not directly tied to any of those events. I felt like crying, but I couldn't cry. I felt something like a physical desire to perform an act of goodness with my own two hands, to do something decent for somebody else. I felt like doing a think like that would make those feelings of sadness inside me go away. That's as much as I can explain it. I'm not saying it right. I don't know how to say it right.

An old man scrubbing vandalism off a church


Do you reflect on your life?

Who has time for that? I just work and exercise and eat at restaurants and buy gadgets and surf the internet and visit friend and family. I feel like I exist in a tunnel of activity. How did I get here? I don't know. I really don't. It all seems so random and meaningless, like billiard balls bouncing off one another.

Reflect now.

Now?

We have time.

What do *I* know about life, about the world? What knowledge do I have that is not from outside, from things I was taught to believe, or instructed to memorize, or read in books, or saw on television and in the movies, or heard from somebody on the street corner. And the answer, I think, is, not much. But whatever it was that made me want to help that poor crippled man, that did not come from.

After the meal he goes to the movies, watches Cars 2, the only thing playing, feels like something light, comes back and goes for a swim in the heated pool on the roof, glass-covered.

The government official thinks its a miracle
The psychiatrist things its a coincidence
Will does not analyze it

What happens now? 1-5-2014

Will returns to the hotel, goes for a swim in the pool upstairs, then takes a shower. He receives a phone call from a psychiatrist who wants to meet him in the lobby. Will goes down to meet him. The psychiatrist suggests they go to  the restaurant next door. They eat Peruvian food, talk about what Will is feeling.

Afterwards Will goes to a theater to watch a movie, a kids movie. Then to bed.

In the morning he has breakfast and waits for the cab to take him to the airport. Along the way they stop at Park Bustamante and Will has a sandwich, admires the park the people and the dogs.

Will, I am going to be straight with you. For people who have gone through traumatic experiences, which you most certainly have, there are two ways it can go. One you are fine, you accept the past and move forward with clarity and a better understanding of the world around you. But it could go the other way, you could get pulled into isolating paranoia. Your anxiety can get the better of you, alienating you from others, locking yourself indoors, seeing the worst in people. Thinking everyone is out to get you. I do not want this to happen. This is bad.

Bring the subject back to medication, how he has dealt with things in the past. Will's reluctance to take medication, the doctor explains how he sees medication.

What happens now? 1-18-2014

Will wakes in the morning, takes a shower, checks out of the hotel, where someone tells him the car will be arriving in an hour to take him to the airport. The driver will have the tickets. Will leaves his bags with the concierge and asks where he can grab a sandwich. There is a bakery around the corner that makes good sandwiches. He walks outside and it is an unseasonably warm day. The sky is clear and blue, the smog washed away by the rain, so that you can see the Andes clear on the horizon, their snow-capped peaks.

What happens now? 1-20-2014

Will walks around the corner to the shop and orders a Cuban sandwich, the special for the day. He leaves the shop and comes to the Park Bustamante. He walks around the dirt path where construction has been going on, past the large bronze statue of a ship. He comes to an open ground with a playground and sits on the grass under a tree. He watches the children playing, the dogs sleeping underneath another tree, a couple making out, a vendor selling hot dogs, two police officers on horseback, a bust of Abraham Lincoln with a pink spray-painted beard. He eats his sandwich. There is a young boy, blond, playing with a puppy. He watches them play.

Once his face had been burned into his memory, his actions had become inevitable and he heard himself telling the driver, "Stop here. I changed my mind. I have to do something." And at that moment even he questioned his motivation. There wasn't one. All there was was that face in his mind, the face of suffering.










REWRITE NOTES

Up until the meeting at Juan Valdez, interleave IM conversations. Increase their connection, until it ends with her suggesting he should come for her birthday, a grand romantic gesture. She does not ask though.

What is outside your window?

First thing Ben says to Will, "Why so glum chum?"

The dog he watches should not be happy, this is to balance with the dog at the end who plays with the boy
In the interview with the police agent, there should be a camera, less emotion, more back and forth answers


I never understood atheism. Nothing observable spontaneously exists. Everyting comes from a source. The source of you is your parents...and back and back to molecules and atoms. But here is the thing. At some point, the atheist says, 'enough', we've gone back enough. We don't have evidence and so the rational conclusion to draw is after this point is nothing. You might say, well we only rely on observable facts, but in fact they deny what they observe. The source of everything is that which we call God. Now, the question of its characteristics is not known, however since the smallest contains the largest we can intuit the nature of God. Is the God of Christianity accurate? Probably not. Is Allah of Islam accurate. Probably not. Is the Self of Hinduism accurate. Probably not.

Fulbright conversation around soulmates vs biological reasons for mating, remove other conversation points unrelated to furthering either the story or themes.

At the end, remove the dog the boy plays with, end with detailed observation of the boy, ending with him embracing his mother. The boy is happy, cheerful, bringing joy to all whom he meets (not sure about removing the dog, maybe it works)

A profound insight is contained in the most basic teaching of the Christian faith, hidden in plain sight, as the saying goes. The Golden Rule. It transcends the dogma of religions, accepted by most every religion, rationality there is. Simple, logical, rational. Do unto others as you would have them do unto you. That is, the authority to know right from wrong is something inherent to our nature, the ability to judge what is good and evil, right and wrong. Is in yourself. Not in the book, not in the dogma. Jesus is the Holy Savior and all that nonsense. It is repeated in various other places in the Bible as well. In Luke.

At the hotel and movies and restaurant, he watches the other people, does what they do. Not sure why.

After the first night, wakes up with a physical feeling of loneliness and isolation. A prison that he can't escape from.

A sentence acknowledging that his gluttony and inebriation was some kind of subconscious numbing, and that eventually he would have to deal with the Constanza situation.
