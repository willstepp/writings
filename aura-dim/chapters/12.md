  He was sitting on the bed in the hotel room, in the late afternoon, the device in his hands, the computer screen in front of him lighting up his face. He stared at the photograph of the birthday party, her about to blow out the candles, and even now he could feel the excitement of that moment, he felt her anticipation as if it were his own. He went to the sink and washed his face. A little of the nauseous feeling remained so he lay on the bed until it went away. All the things he had seen and heard and felt during their communion went through his mind. But one thing that he kept returning was the computer in the house, the old house where the birthday party happened, in the small bedroom. It was out of place in a conspicuous way. Remembering a detail from the Aura notes, he turned the computer screen towards him. He found the notes again and scanned them until he found the passage he was looking for.

	She told me about her family, how her daddy had left when she was only five years old. Turns out she grew up in house in Shannon village. Not that far from the house I grew up in. Life is funny man.

  Looking at the photograph again, this time focusing on the background details, he noted the number of the house. 1293. The only other detail of significance was a powder blue water tower above the tree line in the distance across the street. Too far away to make out the writing on it. But maybe that was enough.
  In the Maps application he turned on GPS satellite data and zoomed in over Shannon, a part of town north of downtown. Eventually he did find an old water tower but it was painted green. He couldn't find another. He made a guess at how far away you'd be able to see the tower and marked a radius. He clicked around the neighborhoods to find a house number like the one on the house but could find nothing. There was still enough daylight to drive up there and see what he could discover himself. On a pad near the telephone he jotted down the street names where he needed to drive. He packed up the computer and device into the backpack and headed out the door.
  Headed north he kept a paranoid eye on the rearview mirror. He passed the jailhouse and the Dodge dealership and drove five miles to Shannon. When he turned into the main road through the village, 1st street, he looked out for the road that would take him to the water tower. Ten minutes later he was there, the pine green water tower surrounded by a rusted chain link fence. 
  He took a side road near the water tower and drove to the cross street that marked the outer edge of the radius. From there he drove down the streets, looking for anything like the house in the photograph or in the communion. This was a poor neighborhood with its best days clearly behind. The cotton mill which supported the community had shuttered ten years ago. He knew that because it had been one of the few good places to work. He passed a group of kids playing ball in the street. They glared at him as he went by and continued to stare after he had passed.
  As he drove he looked over the trees to see what the tower looked like. Most of the time he couldn't see it at all, which made him doubt his radius. But as he turned into streets closer to the tower he began to see it. Only the top at first but then more and more of it. And eventually it looked a lot like in the photograph and he knew he was in the right place, if it even was the same water tower.
  It was late and the sky was turning orange and the clouds in the sky were gray. The light was dimming in the neighborhood, he was not sure he would even be able to see the house by now. He turned down the next road, barely making out the sign before he turned. It was a narrow street, nearly one lane. But it was open, the trees were less dense, and so there was more light to see by. And then he spotted a house on a small hill. The yard was overgrown and the house itself was in disrepair, but despite that he recognized it as the same one, at least from a distance. He pulled into the gravel road next to the hill and stopped the car. He got out and found the water tower in roughly the same place it was in the photo.
  He approached the house with caution, deciding to walk around the back first. The windows of the house were either boarded or covered with plastic. On the front porch was a sign that read _No Trespassing_. The surface of the house was molded and covered with lichen. Black, damp leaves on the ground surrounded the place. He spotted the side door which he had held open for her mother during the birthday party. There was a board over the door, nailing it shut. Out the back window was a thick cord which ran into the ground. He pulled it up and followed its direction and figured it went to the nearest power line by the road. He went to the window and peered inside. He saw broken furniture and dishes on the floor. Nothing else.
  Once he had walked around the entire house he tried to find the best way in. Of course the front door was locked. He knocked on it just to see if he could hear anyone inside. But there was no answer and no stirring inside. By now it was dusk. He found a window where the plastic was torn and was able to fit himself through and entered out into the living room.
  "Zoey?"
  There was silence.
