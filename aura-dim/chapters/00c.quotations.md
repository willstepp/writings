"For these things I weep; mine eye, mine eye runneth down with water, because the comforter that should relieve my soul is far from me: my children are desolate, because the enemy prevailed."

Lamentations 1:16


"There's nothing left alive, 
but a pair of glassy eyes.
Raise my feelings one more time."

Gimme Danger, Iggy and the Stooges
