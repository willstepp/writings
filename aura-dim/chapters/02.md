 Morning. Light bled in from the bottom of the door and from the useless curtains which never closed all the way. He awoke on the bed, his head towards the foot of it, on top of the blanket and sheets. No pillow. He always slept that direction to be closer to the heater. Using his left arm as a pillow had cut off its circulation. He moved his arm for several minutes before the pinpricks faded. He had slept hard in the night and had not dreamed. There had been a heaviness to his sleep that was hard to shake off, hard to keep his eyes open. It was not just the whiskey, though it didn't help.
	The TV was still on. Such was his dreamy state of mind, one second the room was silent then the next he heard the sound of it blaring, a particularly obnoxious commercial about breakfast cereal. He lay there and listened, his eyes still too heavy to get out of the bed. Soon he heard the news, a beautiful Latina voice reading the local headlines from the Atlanta metro area.

  "Top story this morning, we have updates on the break-in and subsequent explosion, which occurred last night at a technology research center on the Berry College campus in North Georgia. Footage was recovered which showed an old car speeding through the security gate at 11:05 pm. The car drove to the research center and two suspects emerged with garden tools and a can of gasoline. They broke into the building, as seen on this footage, by smashing the glass doors, triggering the alarm. Ten minutes later they emerge from the building, carrying unidentified objects, and speed away. Approximately 11:37 pm an explosion occurs in the east side of the building, and slowly spreads until it is visible on the security tape, here. It was thought originally the building was empty, but we have confirmation from school security there was a single student logged into the building, apparently working late, and so far authorities have not been able to locate this student. We have approval from local police to show an image of the student, who has been identified as Zoey Jackson, a graduate student in the computer science program at the college."
	
  He arose and watched the story intently, the recollection of the news from last night coming back to him, slowly, vaguely. His blurred vision focused on the image of the student, a nice looking black girl, smirking, the mugshot-like quality of the photograph obviously from her student identification.
  
  "Ms. Jackson has so far not been found, nor reached by contact information on school records. Police have begun a search for Ms. Jackson and would like us to provide a phone number where you may call anonymously to provide information, about this incident. If you do have information, either regarding the whereabouts of Ms. Jackson or the two perpetrators, please call the number at the bottom of the screen. In other news..."
  
   It came back to him, how he had recognized the unmistakable tail lights of that old Dodge in his drunken state last night. But then there was just a blank. Nothing. He remembered nothing else. But it was them. Who else would drive such a piece of shit? And then it hit him. He shook off the remnants of sleep and went to the table by the window. There on the table was the notebook, the computer Grady and Jenn had convinced him to trade for the drugs last night. He opened the lid and turned it on. The login screen came up and he recognized the username from last night, z.jackson.
   He shut the lid and went to his phone. It lay next to the bag of empty Krystal boxes, now crawling with roaches, feeding on the dried onions and mustard. "No. No. Please don't let me be that fucking stupid," he said, and then let out a tortured "Fuck me" when he saw his last text to Grady,
   
Saw yr ass on the news just now!!! The fuck? Lotta nerve tradin me hot shit. Hit me back!
   
  He looked at the text in disbelief and finally tossed it on the bed. He paced the room for the next fifteen minutes, stopping only to vomit in the toilet, a combination of nerves and the hangover. He poured some water from the bathroom faucet and drank it down. His mouth was dry and now slimed and the cold water washed away the acid taste. He went to the window and peaked out, the parking lot during the day emptied out as the out-of-town construction workers and electricians went to work. Nobody was outside. He saw the woman who worked the day shift in the office, on the phone. Then he turned back to the room.
  He went to the bathroom and pulled down a rag hung over the shower rod, wet it and returned to the computer. He wiped it down, picking it up with a t-shirt, both inside and out. Then he placed it in the Krystal bag and tied a knot. Roaches escaped and scurried behind the mirror. He put on his jacket and beanie and took another peak out the window. Nobody. He grabbed his wallet and keys and went out the door.
  Outside he turned to the right, where an old busted washer and drier sat unused. Then the ice machine, which was. The only thing past the machines was a small empty yard behind the office and a chainlink fence marking the boundary of property. He went towards the yard, around the end of the building and turned a corner to the right. This led him to the alley behind the rooms, a narrow dirt path parallel to the fence, woods behind. Now the bathroom window of all the rooms overlooked this alley, so he knelt low and crept as fast as he could with the bag in hand, all the way down.
  At the other end of the building, around that corner, was a brown garbage bin. There was a thin row of pines separating the bin from the road, sidewalk, morning traffic going by. The bin was closed from this side, since everybody used the more convenient side facing the hotel entrance. But he wanted to remain unseen. He waited and then when he was sure nobody was around he crept up beneath the back of the bin. He slid open the backside and tossed in the bag then closed it. Then he went back the way he came, the same way he went before, creeping, quiet.
  He got in his pickup and looked at the text once again. He nearly picked up the phone to call Grady, then thought better of that. He nearly sent a text, then realized just how stupid he was being. He pumped the gas a couple times then turned the ignition. He let it warm up then pulled out and headed down Martha Berry then up the bypass, towards Kingston.
  The local station was playing music, top 40, interrupting only for weather updates, more cold, black ice on bridges, but no news about the break-in. No panic. He kept a close watch in his mirrors for any police. He was taking a chance but the data on that phone was incriminating. He was sure it was a burner, he didn't deal with folks who didn't have one, but as long as it was on their person it could incriminate him. And that could not happen. He went the long way, around Ward mountain, instead of the more direct route. He came up Price Road where he knew there was a dirt utility road leading into the woods which surrounded the trailer park where they lived. He drove up and down the road a couple times, to lookout for any police, any suspicious vehicles. Nothing. It was still soon. Good he acted when he did.
  He turned into the utility road and navigated the deep ruts and icy mud holes until he was well hidden amongst the pines. He tucked the gun into his jacket pocket and got out. He made a best guess which way into the woods would lead him to their trailer. He had only been there once, years ago, when he and Grady were drinking buddies and not customer client. The dried leaves made so much noise as he shuffled into the woods he wondered if this was a better idea than just driving up. He did his best and tried not to shuffle as best he could.
  Gusts of wind blew through the pines. He stopped and leaned against a tree. In the clearing he spied the backside of a trailer. He kept walking. Soon he emerged from the wood line, creeping along the edge of it, where he would hopefully remain unseen. Down towards the cul-de-sac he recognized the faded yellow siding on Grady and Jenn's single wide, behind which was a shoddy porch and natural gas tank. Pulled into the trees nearby was the old Dodge, well hidden by broken branches and leaves piled on top. He went up the steps of the back porch.
  Through the back window he saw the stove overhead light on, fast food wrappers on the counter, though sunlight beamed through the living room window, next to the entertainment center, a cheap shelf with a small flat screen TV on top, The Wizard of Oz playing on it. No signs of Grady and Jenn. No signs at all. He drew his gun and knelt beside the door, then rapped twice with his knuckles, quietly. A minute passed, he knocked again, louder this time. Waited. Two more minutes, nothing.
  He thought to text Grady, let him know he was back there. He thought they might be hiding. It's possible they were on the run, but knowing them, not likely. He banged on the door with his fist, waited a minute, and heard nothing. On the left end of the trailer was a small bedroom window with a wooden box underneath. He crept around and climbed onto the box. Cupping his hands around the pane he tried to make out what was inside. It was too dark. With no affordance to lift the window he pushed up against it with his palms and after a few moments of intense strength it slid up.
