Vintage Dodge, The Notebook, Shithole Hotel, Beating of a Neighbor, Local News

  Headlights illuminated a shopping cart turned over in the alleyway behind Huffaker Crossing, an abandoned strip mall where the Krogers used to be, where he liked to meet up with customers this side of town. *That Dodge makes enough noise to wake the dead*, the man in the pickup thought. *Grady's got his head up his ass if he thinks he's gonna ever restore that old rust bucket. Poor motherfucker*. The car turned into the darkened area where his pickup sat idle and the beams entered the cabin and blinded him. He shielded his eyes as it pulled adjacent. The lights switched off but the motor was kept running, smoke curling from its tailpipe. In the silence that followed the man in the pickup listened to the patter of sleet on the rooftops and the moans of wind through the power lines overhead. As he waited for them to get on with it, he looked at the paint flaking off the corners of the doors and the concrete pylons that shielded the air conditioning units, rust in those places. Everything was cast in amber hue, from a pole at the other end of the corridor. Behind the alley was a thin tree line, behind which was an unused railroad track and beyond that a trailer park of Mexicans.
  The man had arrived nearly half an hour ago. He always did. There was this classic song called Waiting for the Man, with a refrain that goes, *first thing you learn is that you always got to wa-hait*. What horseshit. The way it really is, you get there before the other guy, always. Scope things out, peer behind the bins and around all the corners. Under rocks. Everywhere. Be paranoid. No doubt that was why he was still breathing while many others he knew of were not.
  The door opened and in slid a woman and a man. 
  "Shut the goddamn door," he growled, "Its fucking cold out here."
  The man slammed the door. The woman lit up a cigarette and opened the tray in the console. Between his legs the man held a backpack of unknown contents.
  "Will baby, how you been, darlin?"
  "Jenn."
  "Yo, what up Will. Thanks for meeting us so late."
  "Grady."
  Jenn ashed her cigarette in the tray. She was thin. As thin as he had ever seen her. Hair wiry, greasy. Fingernails bitten to the quick. Skin ashen, pockmarked. And those teeth. Jesus Christ. He remembered a time she had been attractive. Beautiful even. Back then her hands didn't shake like that when she smoked. Back then there was light behind her eyes. Vacant now.
  "Dude, what you gave us last time was straight. We was trippin' balls for like seven days, I swear!"
  He said nothing, only palmed the handgun in his left jacket pocket. Nodded. Then with his right hand he pulled out the eight ball, tied in a plastic baggie. Both their eyes went there, squinted.
  "Well there it is," Jenn said, "But here's the thing Will, this here is me and Grady's last score. We going straight edge after this one last time. God as my witness."
  He didn't respond, only looked at them both, nodded.
  "Let me tell you something, Will," she continued, "That shit right there. That shit will kill you. Deader than hell. You bet your ass. It robs you of your life. It robs you of your kids. It don't care one iota. It will take everything away from you. Believe me."
  "It's three hundred. Just like before."
  The tweakers both nodded and then Jenn turned to Grady and gestured to the backpack in the floorboard.
  "Show him, babe."
  Grady reached down and unzipped the backpack. But as he did so Will pulled the gun from his jacket and held it aloft, pointed at Grady.
  "Whoa there, buddy. The fuck you doing?"
  Grady raised both hands, palms out, innocent.
  "Bro, its cool. I swear to God."
  "Will, its just a notebook. That's all it is."
  He looked from Grady to Jenn, in disbelief. For a few moments it was absolutely quiet, the only sound the heater and a song on the radio playing so low you couldn't make it out.
  "Let me explain, Will."
  He nodded.
  "Look, basically me and Jenn were on a job tonight. On the down low if you know what I mean. They said we could take whatever shit we found, from the place, and we got this notebook and backpack. We won't be getting paid until next week for the job but figured we could get a ball from you, and maybe pay you with this notebook, which is worth a hell of a lot more than three hundred. That's for damn sure."
  He grew impatient with their stupidity, with their naive attempt to manipulate him. He snapped. "What the fuck do you mean notebook? Start making sense, or I don't know what I'll do."
  "I told you we should have asked him ahead of time, Grady."
  "Bullshit, Jenn! You told me we needed to wait, show him in person. Throw me under the bus, you fucking bitch!"
  "Don't call me a bitch, motherfucker. I'm the best thing you ever had in your life."
  "Hardly," Grady laughed.
  "Hand me that backpack. Right. Now."
  Grady looked at Will, then nodded. He reached for the bag.
  "Not you, Gomer. Let Jenn do it."
  Jenn put down her cigarette. She reached for the bag.
  "Slower. I don't want to see your hand anywhere near the zipper."
  She slowed down, picked up the backpack by the shoulder straps and held it out to Will. He unzipped the bag with his free hand and reached inside and pulled out an aluminum computer, silver, in perfect condition.
  "A computer? Why didn't you just say so?"
  Grady shrugged.
  "Hell I don't know, I always call em notebooks. Ain't that what you call em?"
  "They're laptops babe."
  "Well you didn't help clarify anything before."
  "Fuck off, Jenn."
  "Don't tell me to fuck off, Grady. You don't talk to me like that!"
	"Shut the fuck up you two."
	They stopped cold and looked to Will. He said nothing. He handed the computer over to Grady.
	"Turn it on."
	Grady lifted the lid, pushed a button and the screen turned on, the keyboard lit up, and the fans started blowing.
	"It takes a few minutes to get crunk up. But it's a real nice one, as you can see. No scratches or dings or nothin. This thing you could sell on Craigslist for a thousand bucks. A thousand easy. We looked it up online."
  "But then we got to thinking," Jenn stepped in, her voice softening, "to save time, what if you just let us give it to you in exchange for a ball? Then you could make a ton off just this one score. Just this one time, you know."
  Grady interrupted, selling it.
  "It works good, see, we tested it out. Its even got some battery left. Got all the wires, in the bag there."
  The login screen lit up the inside of the cabin, a green leafy background. Grady typed in a few keys to show that it worked. A message popped up that the password was incorrect.
  He put the handgun pack into his jacket pocket and reached over and grabbed the computer. It was heavy in his hand. Solidly  built. Brand new from the looks of it.
  "So what's it gonna be?" Jenn asked, with such brazen confidence that Grady shot her a look.
  Will said nothing but regarded them both with careful eyes and then ran his fingers along the outside and over the keyboard and then closed the lid and weighed the computer in hand.
