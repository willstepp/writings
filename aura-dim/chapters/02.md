Vintage Dodge, Notebook, Weekly-Rate Hotel, Beating of Neighbor, Eleven O Clock News

Headlight beams from a vintage Dodge Dart moved over the alleyway behind Huffaker Crossing, the abandoned strip mall where the Krogers used to be, where he liked to meet up with customers this side of town. Light shined into his pickup cabin, blinding him momentarily, as the the beater pulled next to him and stopped. Nobody made the first move. It was so quiet they could hear the sleet falling onto the vehicles, the wind moaning through the power and phone cables swinging overhead. Paint flaking off the corners of the doors and the concrete pylons that shielded the air conditioning units, rust in those places. Everything cast in amber hue, from a pole at the other end of the corridor. Behind the alley was a thin tree line, behind which was an unused railroad track and beyond that a trailer park of Mexicans. At last the man in the pickup donned his hood, zipped up his jacket, and got out slowly, his right hand on a revolver in his right jacket pocket. He walked around to the passenger side, opened the door, motioned for the girl to slide over. He got in.
  [They are afraid of him, treating him like a dangerous animal, he senses it, feels glad]
  The girlfriend got out first, tight jeans, black halter, an exposed midriff even in this cold, visible stretch marks, the kindness in her eyes a giveaway. She greeted him.
  "Tina."
  Then he spoke to the boyfriend who was taking his sweet time with something in the car.
  "It's cold man. Let's do this thing."
  "Dude, what you gave us last time was straight," the girlfriend interrupted with a grin, the sound of her voice uncouth, gravelly, harsher than a female voice should be at her age.
  "Good."
  The boyfriend got out and slid up next to her. He put his arm around her waist. The man noticed some kind of bundle tucked underneath his arm, wrapped in a garbage bag. The two of them exchanged a glance so subtle it would have gone unnoticed any other night.
  "What's in the bag?" He asked.
  "Tell him babe."
  The boyfriend gave a look like he was going to slap her down.
  "I got this."
  The man palmed the gun in his pocket.
  "What's in the bag?"
  "It's cool, Will, it's cool. Chill man."
  "Don't tell me it's cool. Don't tell me to chill. Just tell me what's in that bag under your arm. Right now. Or I'm gone."
  The boyfriend glanced at the jacket pocket, assuming what his hand grasped inside. His eyes grew panicked and then he lifted both hands in an effort to calm the situation.
  "Will, dude, it's just a notebook. That's all it is. Man I knowed I should of just told you on the text. Tina said you wouldn't hear us out if I brung it up over the phone."
  "Don't blame me," she said, cupping both hands over a lighter, with a fresh cigarette dangling in her mouth. She lit and blew the smoke into the air. The sores around her mouths and eyes, the bitten nails with flaking polish, the stringy hair. He had a glimpse from their school days, her sitting in Algebra, behind him, shoe dangling off her foot, bored. 
  Suddenly he felt an agitation at having to deal with this bullshit, with the both of them, out in the cold, out in the night in this place.
  "What do you mean a notebook? What are you talking about?"
  "Show him."
  The boyfriend watched him, his eyes asking permission before moving. The man granted it.
  He set the package down on the hood of his car and unwrapped it. All the time he kept his eyes on his jacket pocket. He was not naive, Grady, just strung out. In a moment he had the bag off and held it out to him.
  "A computer?"
  "A notebook computer. Ain't that what they call them?"
  "It's a laptop, hon."
  "Whatever. Laptop. Notebook," he said, "It's a real nice one, as you can see. No scratches or dings or nothin. Works good too."
  The man regarded the computer but said nothing, just looked at them.
  "This thing you could sell on Craigslist for a thousand bucks. A thousand easy. We looked it up online."
  "But then we got to thinking," she stepped in, her voice softening, "to save time, what if you just let us give it to you in exchange for the ball? Then you could make a ton off just this one trade. Just this one time, you know. From now on we have cash."
  The boyfriend interrupted, selling it.
  "It works good, we tried it out. We can show you, its even got some battery left. No cord though. But you can get one of them at the Wal-Mart for cheap."
  The man understood. His finger relaxed on the trigger. There was no conspiracy, no LEO, no thugs around the corner, waiting to pounce. Just some fiends desperate to pawn off some loot for a fix.
  "Turn it on," he said to them.
  The boyfriend nodded.
  "Sure thing, Will. Let me show you how bright the screen be on this bad boy. Picture look sharp too. Top of the line right here. Don't make em any better."
  The computer was a nice one, the smooth aluminum body in good shape, no dings or scratches like he said. Keys all there, seemed to work. When it came on there was a bright green lock screen, and the noticed a single user account with an avatar showing picture of a DNA strand, which he pretended not to see.
  He stood back and considered their proposal, but there wasn't much to consider. No doubt he could have it sold by tomorrow, especially if he advertised on the Atlanta board. The tweakers also knew how much it was worth. It was just the disease had them in such a thrall that it didn't matter. They needed that fix to geek out and only tonight would do. So him standing back was a pose to make it seem like he was doing them a favor by accepting the offer, to have that to hold over them when the time came.
  "Whatcha think?" The girlfriend finally said, after nearly a minute of silence. The boyfriend nearly came out of his skin, his eyes widening in her direction, afraid she might blow the whole deal and they would have to endure the night sober.
  He regarded them both with careful eyes and then ran his fingers along the outside of the notebook and over the keyboard and then closed the lid.
