5

  Then he slept. Two hours later the alarm he set went off and he packed the computer into its bag and walked outside through the emergency exit in the back. An alarm buzzed loudly inside the building, his heart jumped and he quickened his pace. It was cold and his breath visible in front of him. The tips of his ears stung by the time he reached the parking lot. He got in and let the truck run idle for a few minutes before driving off. Only after he turned onto Broad Street did he switch on the headlights. By now it was 5 am.
  He drove Highway 27 out of the city. There was no other traffic on the road but soon a semi came over the hill and blinded him with its high beams. He turned on his own high beams and flipped the driver off with a snarl.
  "Fuck you too buddy!"
  He turned left at the Coca Cola Bottling Plant and passed a sign that read Riverside Industrial Park. Lucky for him several of the pole lights were busted. He switched off his headlights and drove in the dark, able to see dimly by the pale moon over the trees. He passed the Old Fashioned Bakery Distribution center and saw a line of white trucks, drivers sleeping in the seats. Nobody around to see him. Nobody who cared anyway.
  It was obvious he had reached the research facility when he saw the bands of yellow tape across the entranceway and all around the perimeter. He drove past and nearby found a small culdesac almost completely obscured by the woods. He pulled in and parked. He fished out a flashlight and put on the backpack with the computer and set off through the woods towards the facility.
  He brushed aside limbs only to have them lash back into his head and torso. He gazed up and saw the sky had become gray with morning and he knew he didn't have as much time as he would have liked. He figured the earliest any investigators would arrive would be after 9 but wanted to be long gone by then. With luck he would be.
  Soon he emerged from the woods and saw the vast black shape of  the facility looming overhead. Doors on every side were sealed with particle board, nailed around the edges. He would rather been have subtle about this but there was no time for that. He picked up a heavy log near the edge of the woods and heaved it through a un-barricaded window on the rear of the building. It shattered into large shards which fell inward.
  With two hands on the lip of the window he pulled himself up and through, brushing against the jagged edge of the window remains. It pierced his shoulder and he winced but didn't make a sound. He came down hard inside an office. This particular office was not damaged. He went into the hallway and saw things were similar here. No fire damage. No signs of an explosion. He entered the lobby and saw the fragments of glass from the front door glass Grady and Jenn had shattered on the night.
  Several times he stopped mid-walk and stopped breathing. He listened at those moments, wanting to make sure he was still alone in the building. He was keeping a mental map of his path through the darkness, in case he had to make a quick escape. The offices on this level were definitely management, bookkeeping, HR, and not the research teams he was searching for. There were steps leading to the second floor. Here he could see indications of the explosion, random debris, charred drywall, bits of concrete, the walls scorched in places, the paint bubbled, peeling in spots. He went up.
  On the second floor he saw more destruction. This had to be the origin of the explosion. The floor seemed to have been cubicles, decimated now, the walls blackened and scattered here and there. Flat panel monitors poked through the rubble of papers and concrete. He saw the remains of office chairs, whiteboards, picture frames of cute kids. He took a brief look into the next section and saw the lab. It had been a wide open area with stations with computers, destroyed now.
  This was ground zero. This must have been the place where Zoey had run the Aura experiments. If Grady and Jenn had stolen the computer from here, then the device had to be here too, if it were not destroyed. Which it likely was. But he found himself fed by a compulsion he could not really explain, risking being found here, risking being discovered by those dark figures. It seemed worth it to him. He rummaged through the ruins, looking for any sign of Zoey's cubicle. Once he found the proximity of her desk he knew he would find more. 
  One small but important detail he had noticed in the videos he watched. They were not recorded in the lab. They were definitely at her cubicle. He even remembered the number, 21, visible on a plastic card in the background. He looked for anything.
  Outside the sun was shining through the trees, the sky an gray-orange color. Unfortunately he didn't have his phone to see the time, but he knew it was something like 6:30 am. 
  He was rummaging through a pile of rubble when he found a curious picture frame. The picture inside was burned but he could make out what it used to be. It was the same photo as the background of Zoey's computer. The old, faded polaroid of a birthday party in front of a house. He had found her cubicle. With this he quickened his pace, throwing boards and pieces of char through the air, looking for anything like the device. It seemed hopeless. Nothing he found seemed related to a device or Project Aura, or anything else of note. He found pens, staplers, a calendar of kittens, with no information of course. He found bent and burned remains of a small file cabinet. The door to it was locked but he was able to pry it open.
  The first thing that caught his eye was the pink hat with kitten ears, the same one he had seen Zoey wearing in the videos. So this was her cubicle after all. He went through the rest of the contents, cups of ramen, packets of chai, an empty binder, an instruction manual to a printer. Nothing that resembled a device. And that was it. He kept going through the rubble but found nothing of interest. He did find some cables and grew hopeful but it turned out to be for a monitor.
  By now it was past seven. Maybe even closer to eight. He knew there could be investigators, police showing up anytime. So he stopped, reluctantly, and headed downstairs. When he entered the lobby, however, he noticed something he hadn't seen before. There on the wall was a photograph of everyone, he assumed. They were standing outside the facility, on a sunny day, squinting a a crowd. All wearing the same blue Andromeda Group t-shirt. Everyone wore the t-shirt except for the girl in the back. She had on an army jacket, jeans, and a knitted pink hat with kitten ears. He looked at her face, bored, aloof, even contemptuous. He smiled. And then something from her log file came back to him, "I hid the device somewhere the boys in the office will never find it." There were several women in this group photo. So her saying "boys" in that way seemed significant all of a sudden. He had thought it just an expression before.
  Back upstairs the sun was coming into the large window towards the rear of the building. He went directly to the spot where he had found the cabinet and fished out the pink hat. It was dirty but unharmed in the explosion. Being in the cabinet had surely saved it. He folded it inside out and saw a multitude of wires and nodes.
  
  He started the pickup and let it warm up. Then he pulled out of the culdesac and left the industrial park from the other side, out Eden Valley road. It was that time of the morning, commuter traffic. He passed cars and got caught behind a school bus. He grew impatient and zoomed around the other cars, nearly ran over a pack of school kids.
  Once over the mountain he got back on the main road, headed back into town. He couldn't avoid the traffic here so just rode it out. In his mind he made plans to get another place, a hotel he knew up in Adairsville. Nobody would find him there. Then he'd have all the time he needed to examine the device and see if it still worked, and hopefully figure out how much it was worth to those guys.
  As he worked it all out he saw a car coming up on his tail. It was an old Buick, boxy. He tensed up on the steering wheel and watched them out his rearview mirror. One of the men leaned out the window and pointed a gun. It happened so fast it was like a dream. He swerved into the other lane as the shot went off. But of course the Buick just got behind him again.
  He floored the old 350 engine and his truck pulled ahead. He weaved around several cars, attempting to get out of the line of sight. One car honked at him for the reckless driving and he honked right back at them.
  Not having much time to think he just kept going, staying on the main road. His hope was maybe a patrol car would be watching from the median. If he saw one he'd stop and get help. But he saw nothing like it. The Buick was approaching fast, weaving in and out of the cars like they were standing still.
