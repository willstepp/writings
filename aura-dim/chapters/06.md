  The inside of the pink knitted hat was covered with black wires and nodes which were made of a sponge-like padding. To him the device looked dangerous yet even so he hesitated only a moment before placing the hat on his head and pulling the sides down around his ears. Then he saw and heard and even felt things that no human being was ever meant to experience.
	  To him it was like being transported to the bottom of the ocean. He was on the floor of some undisturbed plain submerged in a viscous fluid. Yet he was also still in the booth in the Waffle House, he was still sitting down, or maybe he wasn't in the Waffle House at all. It was hard to tell. At first he could see nothing. Everything was dark, even sound had gone silent. But very slowly, extremely slowly it was not dark anymore. But was not light either. And the sounds returned but very far away, really as if he were at the bottom of the ocean and listening to conversations miles above. He could not recognize his surroundings. Perhaps he was somewhere else. It could be the ocean of another planet, one of the planets of Jupiter maybe. That was as reasonable as anything else. As his vision became accustomed to the fluid he saw shapes coming into and going out of focus. The shapes themselves wavered, as if they were also made of this same viscous fluid. It was all the same somehow. He looked down at his arms and saw two dark and unfamiliar shapes that could have been his arms, might have been, but he didn't recognize them as his own limbs. They did not seem to belong to him at all and moved of their own accord, imperceptibly slow.
  He was not afraid. Nothing about it made him afraid. In fact there was a part of him, somewhere in his brain, that might have even recognized this place. It felt familiar though completely alien to his forty years on Earth. Time passed. Or maybe it didn't. That too seemed connected to the viscosity of everything else. The only indication he had that things were changing was that his eyes were becoming more and more accustomed to this way of seeing. It was getting brighter but with no discernible source of light. The dark amoeba-like shapes around him began to take on more solid form. The sounds which had been miles away were closer now. Not very close and still the effect was like listening to something underwater, but they grew louder and louder. So time was passing though very slowly. As the shapes came into focus he began to imagine what sort of creatures they might become when they did fully form. Imagine if he had been taken to some strange planet. But even fearful thoughts like this were automatic and he did not take them seriously.
  Hours passed. He never became tired or irritable. Never needed to use the bathroom. He was completely at ease just to observe his surroundings. By now he knew where he was. Still in the booth at the Waffle House. He had been all along. The dark shapes he saw floating in the fluid were patrons, the waitress approaching him with a pot of coffee, the line cook flipping a patty melt. By now the light was nearly back to normal, though dimmed, much like the light during a solar eclipse. The sounds too were back to normal with just a bit of reverberation. But the strange thing was that time had not yet caught up to the light and the sound.
  The waitress he had recognized, his waitress, bringing the pot of coffee, had been walking towards him now for hours. The line cook had been flipping the same patty melt for the same duration. Time itself was viscous but just like his eyes and ears had become accustomed to the change so too was his experience of time catching up though it was taking much longer. An overweight woman sitting with two other women two booths in front of him had been sinking her teeth into the same cheeseburger the whole time. It was fascinating to watch. Time was passing so if he watched a particular place for awhile he could see minute changes. The look in the woman's eyes kept grabbing his attention. He thought she was about to break into a laugh the way her eyes were squinting, cheeks rising. His waitress, whose name was Ann as he could read on her name tag, had tired, forlorn eyes. Her mind was elsewhere. This was the face he kept returning to. Everyone else he observed seemed in this moment, except for Ann.
  Funny things started to happen once time had caught up to his normal experience. The dimness never went away and the sounds still came from underwater, but just as time seemed to catch back up, he started noticing the people in the Waffle House. They looked different. He hadn't noticed exactly when it happened. At first he thought maybe the light was changing yet again. But no. The best way he could make sense of it was that the people, and just the people, were more transparent than they had been before. Transparent wasn't the right word. He couldn't see through their bodies in any way. He thought maybe the word he was looking for was dimension. They were more dimensional than before. He could see further into them. Further than three dimensions anyway. But only when he focused and _really_ looked at them.
  What did he see when he looked at Ann? He saw that her mind was on her husband, who had recently been diagnosed with early-stage dementia. He also had a history of gambling and used to make trips to Pearl River Casino and lie about it, telling his wife they were business trips. So he had went through all their savings, took out second and third mortgages, and accrued hundreds of thousands dollars of debt, just when they were both about to retire. So she had to get work. She worked for the state for thirty years but they wouldn't hire her now due to cutbacks. So she took this job waitressing, just to make enough money to pay their mortgages and now the doctors say he'll only get worse and worse and she'll end up taking care of him one day as if he were just a baby and then he'll die and she'll be alone for the rest of her life.
  "Let me fill that up for you, hon."
  She filled his coffee. He looked at her, rubbing his eyes. She caught his eyes and grinned.
  "I sure do like that hat."
  His eyes went to the woman who was biting into her cheeseburger. She was laughing now, the woman sitting next to her was pointing at him, at the pink hat he wore, and they both sniggered and tried to hide the fact when they saw him staring.
  At the bar he saw a character. A young man, fat and balding but whose curly hair went around his crown like a doughnut. Something repulsive about him. He was shoveling in a western omelette with sausage links and coffee. He sat alone, slouched over his plate, frowning. As he looked closer he could tell the man was counting money. Six hundred from yesterday plus the thousand from this weekend, added with what they had already saved made just about ten thousand. He found if he looked closer he could learn more about the man, from the thoughts he could go deeper and explore the memories those thoughts were connected to. Jody, his name. And then saw a young Latina woman, pregnant. She had a bruised face, bruised back where he had beaten her many times. But why? Because he forced her to have sex with strange men in a nearby motel. He had brought her to the United States, promising a future life, a husband, children. Lies he told her. But he was making a lot of money. Planning to move to Florida. Buy a fishing boat, start a business. He was very close to having enough for the down payments but was concerned, afraid even, of getting caught. He wouldn't be able to handle prison. He had started to take Xanax to deal with the stress of dealing with her. Bitch that she was. Ungrateful for the life he was planning for them both. Why was she putting him through this stress? He looked closer and saw the room numbers, 104 and 110. 104 is where they met with the johns. 110 was where they stayed and where the money was, hidden in a gash in the bottom of the mattress.
    At that moment the young man pulled a cell phone from his jacket pocket and looked at a text message. Then he stood and went to the register, paid for his food, and burped as he stood there waiting to sign the receipt. Then he walked out the exit.
    He pulled the device from his head and immediately felt vertigo, like he were falling off a tall building. He caught himself on the table and booth and yelled in a panic. Everyone turned around. But their looks went unnoticed because he next felt an intense wave of nausea come over him. He nearly vomited on the table but managed to hold it in and ran into the bathrooms and collapsed over a toilet just in time. His entire breakfast came up. When he stood he felt dizzy and heavy-headed. He went back to his booth and saw the young man outside, waiting for the light to cross the street. He quickly stuffed the computer and device into the backpack and stumbled through the exit to follow him.
