Computer, Zoey Jackson, Project Aura

  The user interface faded in and a row of application icons popped up from the bottom of the screen. But the most interesting thing was the desktop wallpaper. It seemed to be a faded polaroid taken at a child's birthday party, from the early 80s going by the hairstyles and the clothes they wore. In the middle of the photo was a little girl wearing a pink dress, sitting at a small table in front of a house. She was surrounded by her parents on either side and she was blowing out a candle, which was still lit in this photograph. All around the table were children, clapping their hands, and presumably parents of those children looking on, smiles on their faces.
  Not knowing where to begin he found a folder called Documents and started opening files at random, looking for any clue as to why the computer was so important.

Zoey, it has come to my attention that you have approached several lab subjects with an offer to participate in an unauthorized research project called Aura. I would like to understand the nature of this research, to review any and all documentation you have thus far, and most importantly to get an explanation why you felt no need to notify me or any other manager to get permission use these facilities for your own research (which I remind you belongs to the Andromeda Group, based on section 41-B of the employee contract). Please see me in my office when you arrive and bring along the requested documents. Also your work computer.

Thank you,

Richard Dewey
Director of Operations
Andromeda R&D Southeast

I know you are upset but you need to treat this with seriousness. It would be be in your best interest to cooperate with the Andromeda Group in this matter. I say this both as Director and as your friend.

No friend of mine would spring that kind of meeting on me! Who were those men in the suits? Why did you let them intimidate me like that? You just sat there. So stop talking to me with that condescending corporate speak. You used to be real. I hope you like who you see in the mirror.

----------------------------------------------------------------

Deborah Blankenship in HR has just informed me that when you were hired in 2016 you erroneously signed your employment contract and non-disclosure/non-compete agreement with the name 'Daffy Duck'. We are going to need your actual signature on these documents ASAP.

As I was informed earlier today I am no longer an employee, so I'm not sure why I would sign any documents about my employment now.

This is your decision but let me be clear, you won't be getting your final paycheck until you comply with our request. There is a clause in your contract regarding this very subject, specifically cooperation during end of employment transition. Read it over please.

Zoey, this is not some joke. This is serious, what you did and are doing, and you need to comply with our reasonable request. I'd like to talk to you about this one on one. No men in suits. Please call me.


Excerpt from okc-chat.txt

ShoelessJoel: Hey pinkhatgirl
ShoelessJoel: Why pink?
PinkHatGirl: hey
PinkHatGirl: umm, because i like pink, and hats
PinkHatGirl: and Iâ€™m a girl ðŸ˜œ
ShoelessJoel: And... pink hats?
PinkHatGirl: you catch on fast!
ShoelessJoel: I like red and t-shirts but I don't like red t-shirts.
PinkHatGirl: Iâ€™m guessing your name is Joe and you are currently sans podiatric apparel?
PinkHatGirl: nice, I like red though - I bet youâ€™d look good in a red t
ShoelessJoel: sure??? but it's irrelevant....
PinkHatGirl: oh
PinkHatGirl: what is relevant?
ShoelessJoel: Well... why are you in this site?
ShoelessJoel: You don't look like you need a place like this to find people...
PinkHatGirl: for random sex of course
PinkHatGirl: jk!
ShoelessJoel: Ok... you got me there for a second!
PinkHatGirl: but I do need this place, I never meet cool guys
ShoelessJoel: So... what is it? Maybe you don't have any time to socialize in real life?
PinkHatGirl: do you know any?
ShoelessJoel: You're talking to the coolest guy in town!
PinkHatGirl: I thought I might be, the arm tattoo tipped me off
PinkHatGirl: are you kidding I work all the time
ShoelessJoel: If I sound dull it's just 'cause I had a long day at work today...
PinkHatGirl: what are you here for?
PinkHatGirl: oh, what do you do?
ShoelessJoel: I'm just getting my mind off suicidal thoughts...
ShoelessJoel: But I'm fine! talking to you makes it better.
PinkHatGirl: oh no, I hope youâ€™re joking
ShoelessJoel: I work at a shoe factory.... putting pieces together...
ShoelessJoel: It's boring as hell but it pays my livin'
ShoelessJoel: How 'bout you?
PinkHatGirl: hmm
PinkHatGirl: any shoes I might recognize?
PinkHatGirl: I work in a research lab
ShoelessJoel: It's classified...
ShoelessJoel: Cool! Sounds way more interesting than my story
ShoelessJoel: What's it about?
PinkHatGirl: oh really? so is my work but I wonâ€™t tell if you wonâ€™t
ShoelessJoel: Ladies first! ðŸ˜œ
ShoelessJoel: The factory I work for makes bowling shoes... and tap dancing ones...  weird combo, I know...
PinkHatGirl: this is going to sound ridiculous but I swear itâ€™s real, weâ€™re doing research to experiment how to control software by thoughts
ShoelessJoel: Already?!
ShoelessJoel: Sounds like a sci-fi movie
PinkHatGirl: itâ€™s an honest to goodness field, look up neuroimaging electrophysiology sometime
ShoelessJoel: You look very young... how old are you?
PinkHatGirl: I like bowling
PinkHatGirl: not sure about tapdancing
ShoelessJoel: I like neuroimaging neurophysuiiiologyðŸ˜œ
PinkHatGirl: itâ€™s on my profile, 28
PinkHatGirl: haha, it turns on all the boys
ShoelessJoel: Almost 30! You look 20!
PinkHatGirl: it really can be like sci fi
ShoelessJoel: I know... science nerds get us all the time... ðŸ¤“ðŸ¤¤
PinkHatGirl: I work on visualizing the neurological data, nevermind it gets dull
ShoelessJoel: Does it work?
ShoelessJoel: I mean... like... it seems like Bs but hey, it's the new age of civilization
PinkHatGirl: it does but not to the level you want, like we can hook up nodes to your head and place you in front of two buttons, red and blue, if you think hard about the blue button are able to see that and trigger the button click
PinkHatGirl: itâ€™s not at all really but I know why youâ€™d say that
ShoelessJoel: Think... hard... trigger... hmmm.. sex!
PinkHatGirl: the group I work for is sponsored by all the big companies, google, amazon, Apple, facebook
PinkHatGirl: not THERE yet Iâ€™m afraid!
ShoelessJoel: Heh...jk
PinkHatGirl: bit who knows, one day maybe
ShoelessJoel: But... I would think those companies would fight for it
PinkHatGirl: itâ€™s a consortium, itâ€™s like an open source thing
ShoelessJoel: Like to get the whole thing... sounds like someone will get a lot of money out of it
ShoelessJoel: Aha... open something...
PinkHatGirl: well, I think so too
ShoelessJoel: So.... do you get bored?
ShoelessJoel: Sounds interesting but tiring
PinkHatGirl: we even had the guy who used to be head of cia under president bush come by to see a demonstration
PinkHatGirl: not at all, I love it!
ShoelessJoel: Cia..... oh man... are you kidding me?!
PinkHatGirl: I even work weekends, hence lonely and surfing dating websites
PinkHatGirl: no Iâ€™m not, unfortunately
ShoelessJoel: Good for me!
PinkHatGirl: thank you ðŸ˜Š
ShoelessJoel: It sounds like a cool job...
PinkHatGirl: what do you do for fun?
ShoelessJoel: I talk to pretty ladies like you....
PinkHatGirl: itâ€™s very cool, but way too bureaucratic for me
PinkHatGirl: and stuffy
PinkHatGirl: everyone is wearing khakis and blue button downs
ShoelessJoel: Aha... you need more action...
PinkHatGirl: Iâ€™m not that pretty!
ShoelessJoel: You are!
PinkHatGirl: thanks
ShoelessJoel: To me, you're gorgeous..m
PinkHatGirl: I do need more action, I want to dance
PinkHatGirl: do you like dancing?
ShoelessJoel: What are you doing tonight?
PinkHatGirl: Iâ€™m at the lab
ShoelessJoel: Let's go!
PinkHatGirl: canâ€™t, waiting on test results to compile
PinkHatGirl: but maybe this weekend I could meet up somewhere
ShoelessJoel: Ehhm....
ShoelessJoel: Sure!
PinkHatGirl: for a drink or something, maybe first
PinkHatGirl: then we can talk about dancing
PinkHatGirl: for all I know youâ€™re into square dancing
ShoelessJoel: Sounds good to me
PinkHatGirl: you did mention tap shoes
ShoelessJoel: I make them...not use them ðŸ˜œ
