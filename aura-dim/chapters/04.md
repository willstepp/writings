Computer, Zoey Jackson, Project Aura

  The user interface faded in and a row of application icons popped up from the bottom of the screen. But the most interesting thing was the desktop wallpaper. It seemed to be a faded polaroid taken at a child's birthday party, from the early 80s going by the hairstyles and the clothes they wore. In the middle of the photo was a little girl wearing a pink dress, sitting at a small table in front of a house. She was surrounded by her parents on either side and she was blowing out a candle, which was still lit in this photograph. All around the table were children, clapping their hands, and presumably parents of those children looking on, smiles on their faces.
  Not knowing where to begin he found a folder called Documents and started opening files at random, looking for any clue as to why the computer was so important.

Zoey, it has come to my attention that you have approached several lab subjects with an offer to participate in an unauthorized research project called Aura. I would like to understand the nature of this research, to review any and all documentation you have thus far, and most importantly to get an explanation why you felt no need to notify me or any other manager to get permission use these facilities for your own research (which I remind you belongs to the Andromeda Group, based on section 41-B of the employee contract). Please see me in my office when you arrive and bring along the requested documents. Also your work computer.

Thank you,

Richard Dewey
Director of Operations
Andromeda R&D Southeast
