  This was different. As he focused on the girl in the photograph time seemed to speed up. The only way he could tell time was passing were the visions of things passing by him, as if he were on a speeding train looking out the window at things going by. The thing was he knew he was not going anywhere. He felt the bed, his foot on the floor. He knew he was still in the hotel room. The images he was seeing seemed to be hers but he could not make any sense of them. And when at last he had reached a terminal velocity things stopped moving abruptly and he found himself within a large kaleidoscopic and fractal world, which he saw even when he shut his eyes. In other words this world existed somewhere within his own mind. And whenever he focused on some portion of the puzzle the pieces of it ordered themselves and began make some kind of sense to him. He looked one way and saw a tree and a barn and birds in the air all come together in a waterfall of colors and sounds, and then he saw a path with a boy and a man walking together on a path through the woods. Another way he saw a Ferris wheel and cotton candy and holding hands with someone, mother, and the lights blinking on the rides and the vaguely sick feeling from eating too much fried food and sugar. The sounds were also fragmented but not chaotic like the visuals. The sounds blended into something akin to a low drone or humming and then out of that drone the sounds  would come into focus more clear so you could hear the sound of the bird song or the carnival music, all out of that one sound.
  He was not alone. She was also here. And the frightening thing he started to realize was that this mosaic world also contained his own thoughts, experiences, dreams and memories. And she was free to focus on any of them at will. There was no way to keep anything from her. The very act of establishing the communication had granted her permission to the most secret places of his mind. Yet somehow it didn't matter. Because he knew that here in this world there was no judgement. It was not like the other world. It was difficult to put into words but it was something like this world and its contents of the mind was not his nor hers. The sins he had committed in his life were laid bare as were her sins. And likewise the beautiful things she had seen and accomplished were his and vice versa. And when he witnessed them he felt all the same feelings she had felt and it was like it had all happened to him. So there was no embarrassment, no guilt, only a feeling of total acceptance and whenever necessary, forgiveness.
  He wanted to have a conversation with her but he soon realized that would not be possible here, in the way he would have preferred to communicate. He sensed that she too wanted to converse with him. To communicate with words alone would not fit this place because as he realized words are man-made symbols which represent things, thoughts, emotions in the phenomenal world, and they would not be understood here in quite the same way. It wasn't that he no longer understood words or how to speak them. But for example, because here the word _car_ was not just the word-symbol for an automobile but it was also every memory, fear, dream associated with all the specific automobiles in your life and the life of the person you were in communion with. Nothing here existed as a concept and couldn't be used in that way. There were only the objects themselves, phenomenon. Another way to say it would be that there were no symbols. Everything was a relationship between the thing and your being. So to construct a sentence like 'Meet me at the Cracker Barrel on Sunday morning' would not be possible. It was not even necessary, since time and space had no meaning in this place. Everything here was one experience, all present, all now. You could partake in a dream you once had of flying like a bird over Santiago, Chile, just as easily as revisiting the actual memory of sitting up with your grandmother in the nursing home as she drew her last breaths.
  None of this he understood but felt it like an instinct. It all came very naturally and he was not overwhelmed by the strange things he saw. She must have understood even more, though, because she had already figured out how to communicate here and it was by guiding focus. If you wanted to communicate something you only had to suggest some area of the kaleidoscopic world to focus on and the suggestion could be accepted or not. You could not force anything. It was not like the things he had done to those people, where he filled their minds with suggestions they enacted in the phenomenal world. There was no control because there was nothing to distinguish another. It was all one mind and he was an impulse in this mind and she another.
  She guided him to focus on her past. On how she came to discover and develop the technology which allowed tapping into the stream, which she had nicknamed Aura. He was curious and allowed her to show him and saw the space in front of his eyes spiral into objects and shapes he recognized and then he saw her, walking alone through the woods in the dry leaves and the cold air behind the research facility. It was a clear day and she needed time to clear her head from the jumble of her experiments. Nobody else ever came out here so it was a place she could be alone with her thoughts, and it was here the epiphany came to her.
