  This was different. As he focused on the girl in the photograph time seemed to speed up. The only way he could tell time was passing were the visions of things passing by him, as if he were on a speeding train looking out the window at things going by. The thing was he knew he was not going anywhere. He felt the bed, his foot on the floor. He knew he was still in the hotel room. The images he was seeing seemed to be hers but he could not make any sense of them. And when at last he had reached a terminal velocity things stopped moving abruptly and he found himself within a large kaleidoscopic and fractal world, which he saw even when he shut his eyes. In other words this world existed somewhere within his own mind. And whenever he focused on some portion of the puzzle the pieces of it ordered themselves and began make some kind of sense to him. He looked one way and saw a tree and a barn and birds in the air all come together in a waterfall of colors and sounds, and then he saw a path with a boy and a man walking together on a path through the woods. Another way he saw a Ferris wheel and cotton candy and holding hands with someone, mother, and the lights blinking on the rides and the vaguely sick feeling from eating too much fried food and sugar. The sounds were also fragmented but not chaotic like the visuals. The sounds blended into something akin to a low drone or humming and then out of that drone the sounds  would come into focus more clear so you could hear the sound of the bird song or the carnival music, all out of that one sound.
  He was not alone. She was also here. And the frightening thing he started to realize was that this mosaic world also contained his own thoughts, experiences, dreams and memories. And she was free to focus on any of them at will. There was no way to keep anything from her. The very act of establishing the communication had granted her permission to the most secret places of his mind. Yet somehow it didn't matter. Because he knew that here in this world there was no judgement. It was not like the other world. It was difficult to put into words but it was something like this world and its contents of the mind was not his nor hers. The sins he had committed in his life were laid bare as were her sins. And likewise the beautiful things she had seen and accomplished were his and vice versa. And when he witnessed them he felt all the same feelings she had felt and it was like it had all happened to him. So there was no embarrassment, no guilt, only a feeling of total acceptance and whenever necessary, forgiveness.
  He wanted to have a conversation with her but he soon realized that would not be possible here, in the way he would have preferred to communicate. He sensed that she too wanted to converse with him. To communicate with words alone would not fit this place because as he realized words are man-made symbols which represent things, thoughts, emotions in the phenomenal world, and they would not be understood here in quite the same way. It wasn't that he no longer understood words or how to speak them. But for example, because here the word _car_ was not just the word-symbol for an automobile but it was also every memory, fear, dream associated with all the specific automobiles in your life and the life of the person you were in communion with. Nothing here existed as a concept and couldn't be used in that way. There were only the objects themselves, phenomenon. Another way to say it would be that there were no symbols. Everything was a relationship between the thing and your being. So to construct a sentence like 'Meet me at the Cracker Barrel on Sunday morning' would not be possible. It was not even necessary, since time and space had no meaning in this place. Everything here was one experience, all present, all now. You could partake in a dream you once had of flying like a bird over Santiago, Chile, just as easily as revisiting the actual memory of sitting up with your grandmother in the nursing home as she drew her last breaths.
  None of this he understood but felt it like an instinct. It all came very naturally and he was not overwhelmed by the strange things he saw. She must have understood even more, though, because she had already figured out how to communicate here and it was by guiding focus. If you wanted to communicate something you only had to suggest some area of the kaleidoscopic world to focus on and the suggestion could be accepted or not. You could not force anything. It was not like the things he had done to those people, where he filled their minds with suggestions they enacted in the phenomenal world. There was no control because there was nothing to distinguish another. It was all one mind and he was an impulse in this mind and she another.
  She guided him to a moment from her past. To show she came to discover and develop the technology which allowed tapping into the stream, which she had nicknamed Aura. He allowed her to show him and saw the space in front of his eyes spiral into objects and shapes he recognized and then he saw her walking alone through the woods in the dry leaves and the cold air behind the research facility. It was a clear day and she needed time to clear her head from the jumble of work of that day. Nobody else ever came out here so it was a place she could be alone with her thoughts, and it was here she had the epiphany. She hurried back to her cubicle and pulled from a shelf the first book her father had given her when she showed an interest in computers, _Fractal Programming in C_. She found the formulas for Mandelbrot and Julia and compared them against the work she had done to aggregate output from the neuroimaging data streams. The patterns definitely mimicked fractals. But there didn't seem to be any rhyme or reason to why it worked that way, that she could see at first glance. But this was the connection she had been looking for. If the brain generated a stream of data there were a couple questions she had. One, what was the content of this data and two, was there anyway to interface with it.
  Much later in the same cubicle she was there with the old woman she paid to run the experiments on. The first generation of the device was on the desk. They were taking a break, drinking coke and eating a sandwich from the vending machine. She was excitedly talking about the potential of the device to the woman, who did not seem to understand nor care really. To her it was a chance to sit in the air-conditioned building for a few hours on the weekend, get a free meal, and a few bucks for cigarettes. 
  "The problem as I now understand it is application. I wrote the algorithm to interface with the data stream, which was essentially a reverse-engineered inverse of the output, fed back into it, not unlike noise-cancelling headphones, yet instead of cancelling out it merges and creates a real-time channel. This is how I'm able to know what you're thinking."
  "I'm gonna go outside and smoke. You wanna come?"
  She declined and kept going over the problem in her head. The problem was the channel is only one-way. The possibilities for abuse of such a technology were staggering. In fact she couldn't think of a single positive application of such a tool, except as an invasion of privacy, a weapon, both on a personal level and on the level of governmental control. Terrorism. Though she wouldn't admit it to herself she was looking for a single good reason to keep the project alive. Despite the data she had to believe it was possible for there to be two-way communication via the Aura channel. The other problem was simpler but no less troubling. She knew that at least in theory the data did not require a physical cable between the electrodes. The same information could be transmitted wirelessly. And at the same time she was thinking this she was interrupted by the second epiphany.
  Months passed and the device was now embedded in the knitted pink hat that he recognized. He watched her as she went around the daily work day, pretending to be engaged in the comparatively mundane work of controlling commerce and social media applications by interpreting output of the brainwave imaging. She borrowed time during late nights and on the weekend. Whatever objections her conscience made about using the groups computers and lab equipment were overruled by the sheer excitement. He found he could share her excitement. He felt that euphoric joy she felt when she finally figured out how to go wireless. It was like every step she took forward opened up new possibilities and new problems to solve. Her brain was constantly turning over the problems, examining them as thought experiments. She didn't understand why it worked but it did. It took everything she had not to tell Richard, who used to do crazy experiments in the lab all the time back at Tech. The number one problem was always how to create a two-way communication channel. She knew only once that problem was solved would she approach anyone to let them in. She also had to figure out how to ensure the technology would not be sold or abused. She did not, and had not ever, trusted the Andromeda Group. She knew their interest in this entire field was not the betterment of humanity as much as how to more efficiently deliver advertising and therefore make more money for the shareholders and therefore themselves. This thought depressed her. One late Friday evening she was at the lab alone, sipping whisky, when she got the idea to write an email. She addressed it to the entire group with the subject line, The Future of this Lab: A Manifesto.
  
To Andromeda Group researchers and staff,

I felt inspired this evening to write you all and say something that's been on my mind lately, as a lowly graphics programmer and researcher. Since I've been here, I've noticed a theme in the hallways and in the lab and in the meeting rooms and break rooms of this place that I can't ignore, an unspoken and unwritten law we are all expected to operate by here. In case you don't know what this unexpressed law is, allow me to illuminate you - _The only idea worthy enough to devote time and resources to is that idea which has the potential to make the Andromeda Group and its shareholders mountains of money, either directly or indirectly_. Any other kind of idea does not belong. Any other idea is worthless. And I wanted to write this letter to say it out loud, that this is wrong, more than wrong, its fucking BS! We have such powerful tools at our disposal and we're using it to figure out how to get yet more money out of people!? That is what we're doing with our intelligence and nearly unlimited resources? So this is a manifesto. Resist. Speak up. Work on things that move your heart and mind. Work towards creating a better world for our children. I promise I will. Forever.

Yours truly,
Zoey Jackson
  
  To this email, sent to the entire Andromeda Research team, about fifty to seventy five employees, managers, and directors, she received no reply, except for one, a reply from Richard Dewey, her immediate supervisor, who asked her to come talk to him on Monday morning.
  After this debacle she began to feel very protective of the Aura project and grew paranoid about ways it could be discovered before she was ready. She hid all the files in secret places on her hard drive. The one weak point was that she needed subjects to run tests on. And that created a security hole, since she didn't feel like she could trust the old woman who had been helping her. She was not reliable and could easily be bought. She couldn't go through the normal channels by which they hired human guinea pigs. She thought to put up an ad on Craigslist but that seemed like a bad idea waiting to happen. These things were on her mind when she landed on the third epiphany of this project.
  It started as an insane idea, even to her, coming to her in a state of nodding off one weekend, the device still on her head. In this dream she made a bizarre step of logic that the stream was not necessarily bound to the same physics as normal electricity and that maybe it wasn't necessary at all to be in proximity to the subject. As long as your own stream was reaching out with a particular pattern (which so far seemed to be unique to each person) it would latch on. But how would the software get the initial data to run through the algorithm to produce the connection stream? Here was the major leap. That it was incidental the stream uses electric waves. Since she really didn't understand the mechanism that well, then why the hell shouldn't it work? Maybe just focusing on a particular subject would be enough to receive the stream data. When she awoke the idea seemed very stupid and she couldn't even remember it over her breakfast of coffee and toast that morning. But that next evening, in the dark hours, the idea came again. So wild and out there and frankly insane that she laughed. But she had an itch that night to do something wild and out there and frankly insane. So she modified the software and placed the device on her head. She turned it on and closed her eyes and focused her mind on the old woman who had been helping her. She had no idea where she was or what she was doing. It didn't work. But she felt the stream attempting to do something. She wasn't feeling very imaginative tonight, her brain was tired from being on inventory duty earlier that day. So she opened one of the videos logs of the woman and paused it when she could see her face. At that moment she had to laugh as she realized the utter ridiculousness of what she was doing.
  "Is this real science?" She asked the empty building.
  And a few moments later replied, "Bet your ass!"
  Then she switched on the software, adjusted the device on her head, and focused intently on the old woman's face. And it worked.
