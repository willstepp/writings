  He awoke with a jolt the next morning and before he even realized where he was he gripped the steering wheel with both hands, as if to avoid an immanent traffic accident. But the car was parked. The sound that had woken him was only a nearby Mexican worker with a leaf blower, creating a wind storm for all the rogue leaves in the same parking lot where the Citation was sitting. He wiped his eyes and looked all around. He did not remember driving here. He didn't even know where here was.
  The laptop was open in the passenger seat. He pushed some keys on the keyboard but it seemed it had run out of battery. The device sat in the floorboard, crumpled. The parking lot was mostly empty, a few cars here and there. Nice ones. A Lexus, a late-model Range Rover in burgundy, a silver BMW.
  His mouth was very dry and he had a crick in his neck from sleeping in the drivers seat all night. He got out of the car and stretched. The morning air was crisp and cold, the sky clear, a bright sun just over a huge, white office complex across the street. He waved his hands at the Mexican with the leaf blower. After several seconds of no acknowledgement he walked up and waved his hands directly in front of his face. The Mexican looked up, wearing safety glasses, and pulled one of the neon green earplugs out of his ear. He then switched off the blower and all of a sudden the man could hear again.
  "Where are we?"
  "Que?"
  "What is this place?"
  "Name this place?"
  "Yes. Si."
  "Avalon."
  "What?"
  "Avalon. Av-a-lon."
  He thanked him and the Mexican went back to work. He knew Avalon. It was an upscale outdoor shopping center in the next town over. Just opened, right after Thanksgiving. He had never been there, here. He had only heard the ads on the radio. He packed up the computer and device into the backpack, slung it over his shoulder, and walked towards what looked like the main entrance way, trying to remember why he had driven here the night before.
  It was very nice, much nicer than any mall or store he had ever been to. What struck him the most was how clean everything was. Some of that had to do with the newness of it. But part of it too was how expensive and refined the buildings were. It was like they had spared no expense. The buildings were all the same, a beige sandstone with dark gray trim. The concrete sidewalk was almost white and ever so often there would be a little Bradford Pear tree, its limbs barren now. But in springtime he knew it would be that much more fancy. At the end of the main block he spotted a place that looked open. There was a couple sitting outside, drinking smoothies. He decided to walk there to see if he could find a place to charge up the computer.
  The place was called Just Juice. The sign was bright orange and purple. He went inside where everything was very clean, just like outside. Like a museum. It felt so clean it made him uncomfortable, like he was contaminating the perfection of the place with his human body, with all its hair and sweat and skin. A young woman stood at the counter with a large smile.
  "Good Morning! Welcome to Just Juice. What can I get for you today, sir?"
  "You got coffee?"
  The woman closed her smile just a bit, and winced, as if she hated to have to give him bad news.
  "No sir, we're just juice. For breakfast we make really great smoothies. Would you like one of those?"
  "Yeah, I'll have a smoothie."
  "What flavor combination would you like this morning?"
  "What flavors you got?"
  She pointed to the sign above her.
  "I'll have the strawberry."
  "You get two flavors and one extra for a dollar."
  "Just double the strawberry."
  "Okay, sir. That'll be $5.99."
  While he waited he looked for a free outlet but didn't see any inside. Out the window he saw an extension cord connected to a power strip, with a single fan hooked to it. He figured he could use one of those outlets. A few minutes later the woman handed him the smoothie and he went outside and sat around one of the tables with the umbrella in the middle, close enough that the power cord would reach to the extension cord. He took a sip of the smoothie but found it way too sweet. So he went back inside and ordered a water, just something to quench his dry mouth. Then he sat outside and let the computer charge, all while trying to remember what had brought him here the night before.
  And then he did remember. After leaving the house where he saw Suzanne and Joseph, and that guy James he had the radio on, and heard about a sale at Avalon for one of those video game systems that Joseph had been wanting. So he got on the road and drove here, not thinking the place would be closed. So he pulled into the parking lot and must have fallen asleep. There was a lot going on and he had the feeling that using the device might of had something to do with it too.
  A couple hours later it was warmer and the shopping center was picking up a crowd. The sidewalks were dotted with packs of families, groups of women, carrying bags, dressed to the nines in fancy clothes they probably bought here. He felt out of place but didn't feel like getting up at the moment. The computer was nearly charged. And then, coming down the sidewalk, he saw a woman by herself. He sat up and watched her. There was something about the way her auburn hair blew in the wind and the way her thin figure filled out the peacoat she wore in just the right places, with just the right curves. Her delicate neck was exposed whenever the wind blew her hair the right way and her gloved hands he could tell were just as delicate.
