Tall Grass, Butterly Kite, Pickles, In the Woods, Fried Strawberry Pies

  He flipped down the rear gate of the truck and dug out the blanket and handed it to his boy Joseph, who immediately ran off towards the field, dragging it through the red dirt of the parking area. Suzanne lifted the picnic basket with one hand and cupped her other hand to her mouth and shouted to their son.
  "Joseph Michael, get my blanket off the ground before I drag your ass through it!"
  The boy awkwardly lifted the blanket over his head and kept walking until he reached the tall grass. His wife grabbed the gallon of sweet tea and red plastic cups and headed toward the field.
  "Will, honey, grab the bag of ice when you come."
  "Okay, let me get this kite put together and I'll be over."
  "Don't forget the ice."
  It was a cheap kite they had picked up at the dollar store on the way over here. He opened the bag and attempted to put it together first without the instructions but he couldn't figure out which pole went into which hole and got mad and finally followed the instructions and it was okay. The kite was a rainbow colored butterfly. 
  He wound the string around his hand and held the kite at his side so the wind wouldn't catch it and headed off to where his wife and boy had set the picnic, right in the middle of the field. It took him a few minutes to walk out there and Joseph saw him and ran up and asked to look at the kite.
  "Hold up a minute, let me show you how to do it first. They's a skill to flying a kite. If you don't hold it right its liable to carry you plum over the mountain."
  Joseph grew wide eyed. Then his dad grinned and Joseph laughed. Suzanne was pulling things from the picnic basket, arranging them on the blanket.
  "Did you bring the ice?"
  He shook his head.
  "Shit no."
  "I reminded you to bring it."
  "I heard what you said."
  "Then why didn't you remember to bring the ice, grandpa?"
  "Get off my back, grandma."
  He returned with the ice and saw Joseph playing in the tall green grass. The field was usually mown by April but the county had let it slip this year. The grass went up to his knees. Whenever the wind blew it made gentle waves along the tops. Joseph crawled through the grass like a dog. He popped up every now and then, panting with his tongue hung out. He barked when he saw his father and held up both hands as if he were begging.
  "Hey doggy, you ready to fly this kite or what?"
  The dog boy nodded and jumped to his feet. He ran over and they took the kite out to a little bald spot near the blanket.
He showed Joseph how to measure the direction of the wind by wetting his thumb and holding it up.
  "Now, when you know the direction the wind is blowing, you want to turn your back to the wind and hold the kite up so the wind is blowing into it. Does that make sense?"
  The boy nodded.
  He lifted the kite and the wind filled the sails and ruffled the edges. Joseph jumped behind his father, his eyes wide.
  "Look how the kite catches the wind. That's what you want to see. From here, you make sure to hold onto the spool, like this."
  He grasped the plastic handle of the spool and unwound five loops and let them hang in his other hand.
  "You want just enough line loose so that the kite has enough slack to get into the air and stay there by itself, but not any more than that. Not yet."
  With this he heaved the kite into the wind and it caught the updraft and flew backwards with some force. He let out the slack loops and held the spool with both hands. The line went tight. The kite bobbed against the blue sky, the wind strong. He figured it was a bit too strong for the boy to hold it by himself. But he called him over and let him hold the spool handle with his father.
  "This is incredible!"
  "I know. What do you say we let it get even higher?"
  "Yeah!"
  He showed him how to unwind the spool one loop at a time, safely. The boy studied intently. They unspooled about ten winds and looked at the kite. It was higher now, smaller against the sky. The force of the wind tugged on the spool. He made sure the line wouldn't dig into the boy's hand.
  "It's almost in outer space!"
  "Almost."
  They flew the kite for several minutes. He showed him how to wind the line back onto the spool in case the wind grew slack. The kite dove a couple times and he showed him how to pull back and wind the spool to keep the line taut. In working the kite they had wandered from the picnic site and soon they heard the mother shouting.
  "Ding ding ding, lunch is ready boys, come and get it!"
  Joseph looked disappointed but his father assured him they could fly more once they had eaten lunch. They both pulled in the kite and wound the spool around it. He collapsed the wings and folded it under his arm and they returned to the blanket.
  Lunch was grilled hamburgers, potato chips, and pickles. Suzanne had already poured them cups of sweet tea and had plates set out for each of them. They sat together and ate.
  "Daddy, can I have your pickle?"
  He looked over and saw Joseph had already finished his pickle and chips. The burger remained untouched.
	"Boy you gonna turn into a pickle one of these days."
	"No I ain't."
	"Go on then, eat it and see what happens."
	Joseph reached over and eagerly picked up the pickle. He devoured it in just a few bites. The parent gave each other looks.
	"Suzanne!" he said, "Look at Joseph. Oh my God, he's turning all green. I think he's turning into a pickle!"
	"Oh no!"
	Joseph frowned. He examined his arms and legs then looked up grinning.
	"I'm not a pickle!"
	"Oh yes you are. Now I get to eat you!"
	He grabbed his son under the legs and swung him up and pretended to munch on him. Then he lifted his shirt and blew fart noises on his belly. Joseph laughed and laughed. He set him down and collapsed against his wife, who was leaning on her side. Joseph ran over and sat against his father and mother.
	"Finish that burger and we'll have a treat."
	As the boy picked at his food he nestled into his wife's bosom. Suzanne finished the cup of tea and lay back on the blanket, her head rested on her arm. She feathered his hair and pulled the strands behind his ears.
	"I need a hair cut."
	"Your hair is perfect."
	"That ain't true. I got a bald spot."
	"Your bald spot is perfect."
	He leaned up and kissed his wife on the neck. She kissed his forehead. They looked over and saw Joseph watching them. Joseph came over and lay beside them. The wind picked up and blew the plates into the grass. But no one got up. They laid there, close to one another and looked at the sky. The clouds were moving past. White, billowy clouds. Peaceful clouds. He wondered where they would end up. Those clouds.
	"Daddy?"
	"Yes?"
	"Remember when we were flying the kite?"
	"I do. It wasn't that long ago."
	"No, remember when we were flying the kite and I said it was almost in outer space?"
	"I do."
	"Can a kite go to outer space?"
	"I think so, sure."
	"That's really high."
	"It is."
	"Where will it go then?"
	"What do you mean?"
	"After outer space."
	"Nowhere. There ain't nowhere else."
	"I don't understand that."
	"Space goes on forever and ever."
  "How far is that?"
  "Very far."
  "Can we go there?"
  "No."
  "Why not?"
  "Ask your mother."
  But she was asleep, had fallen asleep listening to the wind blowing through the grass and the trees and also the birds which were chirping. And with their stomachs full the man and his son also fell asleep. They napped and woke an hour later. He woke first and looked at his son asleep on the blanket next to him. He listened to his wife's heartbeat and looked up and saw the sun behind a cloud, shining through.
  Then his wife woke and she wrapped her arm around him and pulled him closer.
  "Baby."
	"What?"
  "Them titties sure do make good pillows."
  "Thanks honey, that's sweet of you to say."
  They laughed and that woke Joseph. He opened his eyes and stared up at his mother and father and smiled.
  "Daddy."
  "Yes, son."
  "I gotta pee."
  "Well, go pee then."
  "Where do I go pee?"
  "By them trees, by the woods. Just walk over there and unzip, just make sure nobody sees your pecker."
  "Will."
  "What?"
  "Don't teach our son to say pecker."
	"Why not?"
	"It's uncouth."
	"I'll show you uncouth."
	He turned to face Suzanne and kissed her neck and behind the ears and placed his hand between her thighs, and felt the warmth there. They kissed. Slow and long and hard. Their tongues entwined. He reached his hand up her shirt and felt her body. That soft skin that always reminded him of when they were teenagers. He felt her breasts and the wetness between her legs. They didn't allow their lust to progress too far however, and eventually lay together, breathing deeply, in time.
	"Baby, we need a house."
	He knew that was coming. Their apartment was too small. Much too small to raise a family in. One bedroom, one bath. No yard.
	A scream. It was Joseph, far away.
	They got up.
  "Where did he go?"
  "To pee?"
  "How long ago was that?"
  "Fifteen minutes, half an hour, I'm not even sure."
  "Where did his voice come from? What direction?"
  "I don't know."
  "The woods?"
  "I don't know."
  Another scream came. He listened. There was crying in the direction of the woods. He took off that way. Suzanne followed behind him.
  "Joseph! I'm coming boy, don't worry."
  He entered the woods at a place where there was a narrow path. The pines grew close together, the floor covered in a blanket of straw.
  "Joseph, say something to daddy! I'm coming. I'm here."
  He stopped for a moment and listened over the beating of his heart. Soon a cry came from his right and he ran in that direction, between the thin, narrow trunks, the low branches hitting him in the face.
  The woods grew deeper, darker the further in he went. The sound of Joseph's voice came from there. In his mind were thoughts of snake bites, spider bites, cougars, bears. The worst possible imagery filled his mind. And guilt. A feeling of guilt.
  "Joseph! Where are you?"
  "Daddy!"
  And then he saw him. The light dim. Tangled in a briar patch, his jacket ripped on the thorns, his arms bleeding, his cheek scratched.
  "Son, stay still. I'll get you out. Don't move around."
  Joseph was crying. He was in pain. The thorns had cut him pretty bad. He saw all that as he got out his pocket knife and cut through the thick limbs. Finally he was free and they went to a clearing and he looked his son up and down. Only scratches. But he was shivering, afraid. He knelt and held him close and felt his shivering in his arms. He didn't say anything. He held him close.
  After five minutes he picked up his son and carried him out. He called out to Suzanne that everything was okay. When they emerged back into the sunlight she ran over and looked her son over. They took him to the blanket. He went to the pickup and got some rags he kept in the back seat and tended to his wounds. He shivered for some time still, disturbed, frightened.
  His mother took out some fried strawberry pies from the picnic basket and put them on a plate and sat the plate between them. They sat together and ate the pies and felt the breeze in their hair and the warm sunlight on their faces and evenutally Joseph asked if they could fly the kite again, and they did.
