  His skin pale, clammy, his stomach weak, several times he had to stop and place both hands on his knees and nearly vomited on the sidewalk, drooling from his mouth onto his boots. His vision was still blurry so he was glad to at least know where Jody was headed. He even knew what room number. Still, he wanted to keep close if only to verify that the things he had seen were true. He waited for the light to change for pedestrian traffic and then crossed to the other side. Jody was straight ahead, nobody else on the sidewalk but he was far enough away that he would never suspect anything even if he did turn around. They arrived at the Super 8 and he held back, walking the perimeter to find a spot where he could stake out the rooms without being seen.
  He found a wooden fence separating this parking lot from the one just over, another hotel and a spot where one of the boards had come loose. He ducked between it and crouched. From here he could see room 110 and part of 104. At the moment the door to 110 was partway open. In a few minutes Jody emerged and stood outside the door, one leg propped up on the wall. He pulled a vape pen from his pocket and held it up to his mouth, concealed. Massive clouds of vapor billowed into the parking lot. A few minutes after that he saw a young Latina woman wearing tight jean shorts and a white tank top walk from room 104. When Jody saw her he straightened up and stood by looking around as she walked inside 110. He followed her inside and slammed the door.
  He had seen a few things. One thing he had seen was that Jody, being paranoid, had left an extra room key stuffed inside the gap in the door trim, at the top. This was in case he was out and the woman needed to get out of 104 for any reason. That was the protocol. Only business in 104. No lingering there. The other thing was that tonight was the night when he hung out with some of his other friends, down at the pool hall, for beers and to watch the game.
  Around 3pm a Ford Mustang pulled up and honked twice. A minute later Jody emerged, wearing a bright yellow jersey, but instead of numbers it had a frightening clown face. His face also was painted black and yellow, also like a clown. He got into the car and it whipped around in reverse and peeled out of the parking lot.
  He waited a little while longer and approached room 110. In his hand he carried a brick he found near the fence, just in case he needed to defend himself. Above the door he found the extra key card and put it into the slot. The light turned green and he flung the door open, remaining outside in case the woman had a weapon. Nothing. He went into the room and shut the door. Nobody was there, but the door to the bathroom was closed. The room was a disaster. Clothes were scattered everywhere, hanging on the dresser, on the mirror, black lace bras and panties, a faux leather skirt, shorts, shoes in the corner. A carton of condoms and tissue boxes on the nightstand. Empty two liter bottles of Faygo soda in an overflowing trash can, pizza boxes stuffed behind it. 
  From the things he had seen before he knew exactly where to look for the money. With both hands he flipped the large mattress on its side on the floor beside the bed. The gash was there. He reached in a pulled out several dollar rolls. There were ten total so he figured a thousand in each. He stuffed them into the backpack slung it across his shoulder. But as he began to walk out again he looked back at the bathroom door and saw that it was now cracked open, a single eye peering out.
  He approached the door.
  "I'm not going to hurt you."
  The door shut as he came closer and he heard noises inside. When he reached the door he placed his hand on the knob and twisted. It was not locked.
  Inside on the tile floor, he saw the Latina woman, unclothed, her arms twisted up behind her back, handcuffed to an exposed pipe under the sink. She was not facing him, her back was bruised purple and green, but when she heard the door open she twisted her neck around and when she saw it was a stranger she started screaming. Then a small child, a girl, ran up to her and put her arm around the woman's neck and eyed him as if she were her protector, warning him to be careful.
  He backed away. The girl also had bruises on her arms and cheek. Her hair was unwashed. Clothes covered in old food stains.
  "My mom is hurt."
  He said nothing.
  "She needs a doctor. Are you a doctor?"
  "No."
  "Then you can't help her."
  The corners of her eyes were red and a single tear fell onto her cheek. She let go of her mother and reached out and shut the door on him. He stood for a few moments and then went to the door to the parking lot. He took one more glance around the room and walked outside.
  Jody stood there. He was much taller and stared down at him, his eyes narrowed, his expression hard, still in the clown makeup. He felt something on his chest, the point of a knife. His friend was behind him whose face was also painted.
  He spoke in Jody's ear.
  "Tell him to get inside, Jody."
  "Get inside."
  The blade dug into his chest. Stung.
  "So nobody sees."
  He inched backwards into the room. Jody and his friend came inside too and shut the door behind them. The knife continued to press him back until his legs hit the edge of the bed and he sat down on it. Jody and friend stood over him, looking at him, looking at one another. Then Jody went to the mattress and stuck  his hand into the gash. He pulled out nothing and suddenly flew at him.
  "Where the fuck is my money you goddamn thief? You piece of human shit! You fuck!"
  Jody kicked him hard in the shins. And then stomped around the room, fuming, his chest expanding, arms flexing as if he were ready to explode.
  "You better say somethin."
  He looked at the friend who did not look happy.
  "In my backpack."
  The friend snatched the backpack off his shoulders and rummaged through it. He dumped the computer, the device, everything onto the box spring. The rolls of money came out too, bounced. He picked up the rolls one by one and counted them.
  "They's ten total, Jody."
  Jody had stopped fuming and now just stared at him.
  "What you say?" asked the friend.
  "That's what it should be."
  At that point the door to the bathroom opened and the girl ran out. Everyone turned to her.
  "Daddy, momma's hurt. She told me she needs a doctor."
  Jody frowned at her.
  "Go back to the bathroom, sweetie. Daddy's working."
  The girl returned to the bathroom, looking from her father to the man on the bed to the mattress on its side. She closed the door once inside again.
  "Give me five thousand of that money you have."
  Jody leaned in close to him and looked curious.
  "And why the fuck should I do that?"
  "And why not just kill yo fuckin ass? Is what I want to know." The friend said.
  The man looked at them both but returned to Jody to respond.
  "Because you don't want anybody to know about your business in this room and room 104. That would be bad for you."
  Jody stood up again, eyes widened.
  "And because I want money. And that's all I ever wanted. I got debts to pay. So the deal is you give me half, five thousand, and I walk away forever. And you get the other five thousand and more importantly nobody finds out about your business here."
  The friend leaned in and whispered something into Jody's ear. Jody nodded and pulled out his knife.
  "My friend asked a question. Do you remember what it was?"
  "He asked, why don't you just kill my ass?"
  "Hell of a lot simpler if you ask me." The friend said.
  "Hell of a lot simpler." Jody repeated.
  The man stared at them both.
  "It would be simpler, I agree. But you won't do it."
  "Why is that?"
  "Because you're cowards."
  Jody rushed in again and got right in his face. He held the knife to his neck, the blade on his jugular.
  "You frontin, motherfucker? You ain't go no idea what I'm about! Ask my boy Dave. You think you fuckin hard? I'm the fuckin one!"
  He stared Jody in the eye and saw all the same things he had seen in him earlier, in the Waffle House. Then he closed his eyes and imagined that he would die at this moment and discovered that he truly did not care. He let go of all the waste his life had become, of the things he had held out hope for, to get back again. And it was freeing. A sense of freedom was in that. So he embraced it. And it really was a shock to him when Jody and his friend folded and paid him the five thousand and gave him back his bag and the computer and device. And he was in a sort of unreal state of not being fully present when he back out of the door into the parking lot and walked onto the sidewalk beside the traffic.
