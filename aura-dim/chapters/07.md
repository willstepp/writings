  Along the sidewalk beside Shorter Avenue he walked, unsure where he was going or what he was looking for. But something like a plan was growing in his mind. He had the ten thousand which was about half of what he owed Rodriguez. This would buy him time no doubt but he would still be in debt. Yet when it had occurred to him that he needed a car to get to Kennesaw where Rodriguez did business, it also occurred to him that if he were to jack a car worth money, drive it there, and hand the keys along with the cash to Rodriguez, that might be enough to set him free. There were some details to work out, but the important thing was he knew Rodriguez and his crew were known to deal with underground vehicles, from time to time. And if not, at least he would know where it could be unloaded without drawing suspicion and before the police in that area were looking for a vehicle with that description. The only thing was he had to get out of the city without drawing attention. Assuming he took the backroads into Kingston, he could reach Cartersville, then 75 without even seeing any cops. That it was close to five worked in his benefit, since there would be a lot of traffic on the roads for distraction.
  He crossed the road, stopping in the turning lane to wait for a break in the line of cars. When he reached the other side he went into a Tom Thumb and got a coffee, hot dog, and a pac of Marlboro Lights. He hadn't smoked in hours and was feeling the jitters all of a sudden. As he stood around back of the gas station he saw a gravel parking lot full of cars. Most of them old pickups, old sedans, but there was one that stood out. It looked like a brand new Toyota Tacoma pickup, 4x4, red metallic paint. That truck is worth at least thirty thousand, he thought, and imagined the respect he'd get from Rodriguez if he handed over the keys to that bad boy, along with the ten thousand in cash. After he finished his coffee and hot dog, he smoked while he scoped out the area.
  The parking lot was adjoined to a garage for big trucks, a blue building with a huge sliding door for an entrance. From here he could see all of them inside, one leaning over the engine bay of some school bus, one wrenching underneath a cabover, the others on break outside, smoking, bullshitting. One guy remained in the office but came out eventually and hollered for one of the mechanics.
  He stubbed out his cigarette and walked over to a hidden spot underneath a tree with some bushes. He knelt low and hooked up the device to the computer. It occurred to him that he might be able to leave the computer on in the bag, with the USB cable connected to the device. This would allow him to wear the device while the software was running on the computer in the backpack on his back. He changed the setting that turned the computer off when the clamshell was closed. He then started up the program and put on the device.
  Once again he was transported to the bottom of the ocean but it seemed less intense this time - the visual, auditory, and time drag, all took less time to return to normal. It felt to him like his body was becoming accustomed to the weird transition. So again he found himself looking out at a dim world where things were nearly the same but not quite. He looked at the mechanics in the shop and saw they also had that same kind of extra dimensionality as those people in the Waffle House.
  One by one he looked closer at them, this time concentrating on the thing he wanted to know. Which car was theirs, where were the keys, and were there any hidden in the cars themselves, to make his plan easier to pull off. And he found that he could see that information. _Seeing_ was the wrong word but there is no word for the exact experience, though _knowing_ might be closer. 
  The mechanics drove the cars and trucks he was not interested in. But the manager, the pencil pusher who stayed in the wood-paneled office most of the time, when he came out and he focused on him, he saw the whole thing. First laying eyes on it at dealership on a Sunday evening, going for a test drive that next day, talking to the credit union about a loan, getting fucked over on the trade-in for the his old Mitsubishi Montero Sport, but doing it anyway because he was so excited, signing the paperwork and driving off with it that same day. He saw him wash and wax it and wipe it dry with a microfiber cloth. And then he saw him buy a magnetic key holder and put the spare inside it, and then place the holder under the passenger wheel well, on the frame, hidden from all thieves.
  He removed the device and once again felt the nausea, enough to make him vomit up the hot dog and coffee from earlier, but again not quite as intense as before. And he guessed the more he used it the less nauseous he would be after, until he was no longer nauseous at all. Recovered, he placed the device in the backpack and waited until everyone in the garage seemed occupied. When they were he crept across the road and knelt inside a drainage ditch. Then on hands and knees he crawled to the passenger side of the Tacoma and slid as much under the truck as he could get. Then he fished in the wheel well for the key holder and after a few blind grabs he found it and pulled it  loose. He removed the key and tossed the holder on the ground, then slid out the other side and stood up.
  Two hands grabbed him around the shoulder and slammed him into the ground.
  "What the fuck do you think you're doing, buddy?"
  A kick hit him in the ribs and he doubled over, groaning involuntarily.
  "That's my truck asshole! You fucked with the wrong guy this time."
  Another kick. Then there were voices.
  "What's going on, James?"
  "Caught this sonofabitch trying to steal my Tacoma."
  "Let's call the cops on his ass!"
  "Hey motherfucker, you got like since two seconds ago to get the fuck off our property or we're calling the cops, you hear?"
  One more kick into his side, as he stood up. He fell against the door of the Tacoma.
  "Off the truck, motherfucker!"
  The man named James grabbed his hand and twisted it hard until he felt his wrist was about to break, and he collapsed to the ground again, but quickly got to his feet and stumbled off, into the ditch. He felt a fist come down hard on his left cheek and saw a flash of light and then black as his head hit the grass. Another kick and then the voices were further away.
  "We'll be keeping an eye on you, dickhead. Don't be showing your ass around no more!"
  They were gone. He limped to the place behind the Tom Thumb, where he had eaten his food and drank his coffee and smoked. He collapsed agains the brick wall and sat there for some time, wincing from the pain. He was sure he had a broken rib. After awhile he went inside and went to the bathroom and washed his face. Already his wrist was beginning to swell and it hurt when he twisted his back. He went outside, the store clerk eyeing him suspiciously as he winced out the door.
  He kept walking the sidewalk. Inside he was furious. At himself. At those mechanics. Especially the one. James. He imagined stabbing him in the eye with a fork and pulling out the fork with the eyeball impaled on it and then shoving it down his fucking throat until he choked on it. He wanted to fucking kill him and then keep on killing him until there was nothing left of him to kill. 
  He found himself in another parking lot, walking on gravel. He was walking through a storage facility. He saw a sign U-Stor-It. Rows and rows of of white buildings with sliding doors, padlocked. He walked through them, not seeing anything really, still enraged. But then his eyes caught something in the corner of the place, near the chainlink fence at the edge of the property. An old Chevrolet Citation, green, covered with leaves and pollen dust, a tire partially flat. He changed direction and walked up to it. The door was open. Inside it was musty. He got in. Under the floor mat he found a key. He turned the ignition and the engine turned over but didn't start. He tried again and the same. He tried a third time and it started.
  When the engine had warmed for several minutes he put it into gear and drove it slowly off the lot, out the exit gate. He returned to the Tom Thumb and put some air in the flat tire. Now the thing to do was to get to Kennesaw, pay off Rodriguez the ten thousand, buy himself some time. So he started the car and pulled around and parked around the back side of the gas station, where he could observe the garage and the mechanics. He switched off the car and sat there for some time, watching them. 
  Ever so often they'd scan the parking lot, looking for him no doubt, then return to the job at hand. He hooked up the device and placed it on his head. After becoming acclimated to the view he watched them again. Inside he was seething.
