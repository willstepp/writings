  Frost covered the pile of limbs and leaves that had been his shelter the night before. The sky above was morning gray, low clouds going by, a cold front which had moved in the night before. He lay curled in a position where the pain from his burns was bearable enough to lose consciousness for awhile. It could not have been considered sleep because there was no rest. He awoke from the pain of his burns. His blistered hands reached to his face and felt unfamiliar welts and a rough texture where his hair used to be. A few minutes after that he began to feel the sting of the cold all over his body, especially in his fingers. It took some time before he was able to get to his feet, the pain from moving his limbs was almost too much to bear. He peeled leaves from the raw areas which were the skin had peeled. He zipped up the jacket which was also burned in places and began to walk.
  In this direction the woods were parallel to the main road. Nearby he could hear morning traffic but he was too far away to see it, or to be seen, which was really the point. He trudged over the limbs and twigs and leaves which made up the bed of the winter forest, creating a lot of racket. But he was not troubled. He was not hiding or running, not anymore. He was going back.
  Later in the day the clouds opened up and bright rays of sunlight broke through. The rays came down onto him, warming the wounds and made the agony of the pain worse for him. So he kept to the dark part of the woods, where there was a canopy of tree limbs entwined together. Sometimes there was no path but through the light and he had to wait for the clouds to darken the way again. Like this he walked all afternoon until the sun was low enough so that it no longer entered the woods and he could walk without fear of it. Four miles he covered this first day.
  It was dusk and he no longer had the energy to walk. He found a spot in a ditch that had been dug to some purpose a long time ago, exposing the red dirt which lay underneath the colorless trees. He gathered leaves and covered himself with them in the ditch and rested his head on a pillow of loosened dirt and leaves he had crafted. He was very tired. The pain and walking and lack of any food or anything to drink had drained him. For that reason the makeshift bed really was a comfortable place, warm enough, and aside from the constant aching from his wounds he went to sleep at last.
  He was awoken in the middle of the night by something hot on the skin of his head. At first he wondered if it was just a dream but as his consciousness lifted he also heard breathing and then something wet. He jerked upwards and heard growling. By what little light there was in the woods, from nearby light posts and businesses he saw it.
