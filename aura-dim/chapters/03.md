Library, At Hotel, Another Text, Firetruck, Garbage Bin, 24-Hour Clinic, Library

  The setting sun glanced over the roof of the downtown library, casting long shadows over the cars in the parking lot. He pulled into a spot near the back. It was a hidden spot next to a paved trail that ran alongside the Etowah River. Too risky to park at the hotel. Maybe they had seen the truck during the escape. He took off down the trail. Oak leaves tumbled around his boots. A winter wind. The river was high. Muddy. It would be dark soon. That was what he wanted. He made his way underneath the overpass, winding to the south, to a rusted bridge unused since the new one opened up a few years ago. In fact it was blocked off by a barricade. He jumped the barricade and ran to the other side of the river. Then he walked a few blocks and crossed a few intersections until he was on the road behind the hotel, or what he thought was that road. He wasn't sure but kept going. When he arrived to the hotel he slowed down and walked casually up to his room and unlocked the door. 
  The room was ransacked. The mattress was flipped on its side next to the bed and shredded with a knife, stuffing hanging out. The dresser drawers were all pulled, his belongings strewn on the floor. Same in the kitchenette. Everything that could close was opened. Contents everywhere. Silverware, plates, leftover food, papers from his divorce, the restraining order. Everything. He went to the door and fastened the chain latch and turned the deadbolt. Not that it would do much good. On the back of the door in pink magic marker he read a message, possibly from some prostitute to another, *Don't forget to lock the door, honey!!!*, the dots on the exclamation points were smiley faces.
  He stood near the window and parted the curtains just enough to see into the parking lot. It was twilight and hard to make anything out, but headlights from the five o clock traffic gave him enough light to do a survey. There were late-model sedans, work trucks, a jeep, but near the back he saw a boxy-shaped vehicle and was reminded of the Oldsmobile from the trailer park. Not many of those on the road anymore. He saw smoke from the tailpipe and what he thought were two dark silhouettes inside. He stared at that car for a minute but saw no movement or indication they were watching his room. He closed the curtain. He sat down on the bed and nearly called the police but thought better of that. Instead he turned on the TV. He wanted to see the six news.
  
  "Top Story tonight. Police have confirmed two murdered bodies found in a Kingston trailer park to be the suspects in the break-in and fire which occurred at the research facility on the college campus last night. Police were notified of the bodies by an anonymous phone call this afternoon. The deceased have been identified as Grady and Jenn Upton of Kingston. Related, police have identified the body pulled from the remains of the research facility to be that of Zoey Jackson, a graduate student who was the only person on log to be inside the facility during the time of the break-in. Investigators have asked anyone who has information about the break-in or murders to please contact police headquarters with any information. We'll put a phone number on the screen below. Is it there? Good. Thanks Jim. Moving on, the Riverside Square and Folk Dance Festival is headed to Ridge Ferry park this weekend, and organizers want to know, Are you ready for the Hootenanny?"
  
  He sat on the bed. He couldn't breathe. It was supposed to be automatic but somewhere over the last few minutes his body had forgotten about that responsibility. He took some deep breaths in, but couldn't escape this feeling of suffocation, of drowning. He thought about the computer in the bin outside. He wondered if it were still there. As much as he'd like to forget all of this, he was in it, and the more info he had the more likely he would be to make it out alive. Just like a drug deal.
  He switched on the lamp and wiped his face with his hands. He thought deeply for several minutes, completely still. Then got up. First he went to the bathroom window and wedged the screwdriver where it couldn't be opened. He was sure if they were watching then they would be watching the alleyway behind this place. So it was off limits. He turned off the lamp so that it was completely dark in the room. He picked up the phone in the room and started to dial, but then the cell phone in his pocket vibrated. He put the phone back on the receiver and pulled the cell phone from his pocket.
  
  We need the notebook
 
  No response for a couple minutes. He was about to put the phone back in his pocket when another message arrived.
  
  Please stay put
  
  He tossed the phone on the bed and picked up the room phone. He dialed 911 and closed his eyes, took a deep breath.
  "911, what is your emergency?"
  "Yes ma'am, there is a room fire at the Relax Inn on Martha Berry. The fire is at room 115, and its spreading fast. Please send firetrucks. There are injuries."
  A moment later.
  "Okay sir, fire trucks are enroute to Relax Inn on Martha Berry. Can you tell me who is injured and what are their injuries? Please stay on the line with me as long as you can, until paramedics arrive on scene."
  He hung up.
  Minutes later he could hear the sirens coming down Martha Berry and then saw the red and white flashing lights reflecting off the fast food joint across the street. Then a firetruck and ambulance pulled into the hotel parking lot, followed by two police cars, red and blue lights flashing, reflecting off the rooms and the glass windows. People emerged with concerned faces. He waited for his chance. When enough firefighters and EMTs and police officers were deployed with their gear, when enough hotel occupants filled the parking lot, he made a dash for it.
  He opened the door to his room and crept along the walkway in the direction of the garbage bin at the end of the row. He reached the edge and went around the corner, in the dark, where he would not be seen. He rose and opened the sliding metal door of the bin. It had not been picked up but there was much more trash inside than earlier. It smelled bad. He took a breath and pulled himself up and disappeared into the bin.
  He fished in between the bags of trash and loose wet trash of mysterious origin and eventually found the computer. It was covered in some kind of slime he hoped hadn't corrupted the internals of the machine. But then he heard noises just outside and stopped.
  He listened and thought he heard shuffling on the ground around the bin, whispers, but he wasn't sure. If they were watching maybe they had seen him even in the confusion of his emergency distraction. He waited. There were two openings to the bin, one facing the parking lot, the one he had entered, and another facing the opposite way, towards the small pine trees behind the place. He picked up a large, heavy bag and positioned himself so that he could be facing the opening towards the parking lot with the other directly behind him.
  And then he heaved the large bag out the opening and it landed with a solid thud on the pavement. Immediately he saw two dark figures pounce on it from the side and without a moment of hesitation he jumped backwards and leapt out of the back opening and scrambled into the pack of pine trees up the hill. He heard them behind him and heard their shouts, even a shrill kind of shriek that filled him with primal dread. Whoever they were they were not just doing a job. They seemed filled with rage.
  He slipped on a slick bed of pine straws and felt a hand on his ankle grab hold. He kicked backwards with all his strength while simultaneously heaving upwards on his palms and elbows. He made contact and heard a groan and was on his feet.
  At the top of the hill he spotted a 24-hour lab and clinic and decided that may be the safest place to be at the moment. He tucked the computer under his arm and ran down the other side of the hill into the parking lot of the clinic. The parking lot was almost empty. The sign for the clinic was bright white and red and made him feel exposed. But there was the automatic door under the sign and he ran towards it.
