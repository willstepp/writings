  At the rear of the truck he unlatched the tailgate and dug out the blanket and handed it to his boy Joseph who carried it off towards the field, dragging it through the dirt of the parking area. Suzanne took out the picnic basket and hollered at their son.
  "Boy, get my good blanket off the ground or I'm gonna whoop that tail!"
  Joseph lifted it over his head until he reached the grass. Then his wife grabbed the gallon of sweet tea and the red solo cups and  headed that way.
  "Will, honey, grab the bag of ice when you come."
  "Alright. Let me get this kite put together and I'll be over."
  "Don't forget the ice."
  It was a cheap kite they had picked up at the dollar store on the way over here. He opened the bag and attempted to put it together first without the instructions but he couldn't figure out which pole went into which hole and got mad and finally followed the instructions and it was okay. The kite was a rainbow colored butterfly. 
  He wound the string around his hand and held the kite at his side so the wind wouldn't catch it and headed off to where his wife and boy had set the picnic, right in the middle of the field. It took him a few minutes to walk out there and Joseph saw him and ran up and asked to look at the kite.
  "Hold up a minute, let me show you how to do it first. They's a skill to flying a kite. If you don't hold it right its liable to carry you plum over the mountain."
  Joseph grew wide eyed. Then his dad grinned and Joseph laughed. Suzanne was pulling things from the picnic basket, arranging them on the blanket.
  "Did you bring the ice?"
  He shook his head.
  "Shit no."
  "I reminded you to bring it."
  "I heard what you said."
  "Then why didn't you remember to bring the ice, grandpa?"
  "Get off my back, grandma."
  He returned with the ice and saw Joseph playing in the tall green grass. The field was usually mown by April but the county had let it slip this year. The grass went up to his knees. Whenever the wind blew it made gentle waves along the tops. Joseph crawled through the grass like a dog. He popped up every now and then, panting with his tongue hung out. He barked when he saw his father and held up both hands as if he were begging.
  "Hey doggy, you ready to fly this kite or what?"
  The dog boy nodded and jumped to his feet. He ran over and they took the kite out to a little bald spot near the blanket.
He showed Joseph how to measure the direction of the wind by wetting his thumb and holding it up.
  "Now, when you know the direction the wind is blowing, you want to turn your back to the wind and hold the kite up so the wind is blowing into it. Does that make sense?"
  The boy nodded.
  He lifted the kite and the wind filled the sails and ruffled the edges. Joseph jumped behind his father, his eyes wide.
  "Look how the kite catches the wind. That's what you want to see. From here, you make sure to hold onto the spool, like this."
  He grasped the plastic handle of the spool and unwound five loops and let them hang in his other hand.
  "You want just enough line loose so that the kite has enough slack to get into the air and stay there by itself, but not any more than that. Not yet."
  With this he heaved the kite into the wind and it caught the updraft and flew backwards with some force. He let out the slack loops and held the spool with both hands. The line went tight. The kite bobbed against the blue sky, the wind strong. He figured it was a bit too strong for the boy to hold it by himself. But he called him over and let him hold the spool handle with his father.
  "This is incredible!"
  "I know. What do you say we let it get even higher?"
  "Yeah!"
  He showed him how to unwind the spool one loop at a time, safely. The boy studied intently. They unspooled about ten winds and looked at the kite. It was higher now, smaller against the sky. The force of the wind tugged on the spool. He made sure the line wouldn't dig into the boy's hand.
  "It's almost in outer space!"
  "Almost."
  They flew the kite for several minutes. He showed him how to wind the line back onto the spool in case the wind grew slack. The kite dove a couple times and he showed him how to pull back and wind the spool to keep the line taut. In working the kite they had wandered from the picnic site and soon they heard the mother shouting.
  "Ding ding ding, lunch is ready boys, come and get it!"
  Joseph looked disappointed but his father assured him they could fly more once they had eaten lunch. They both pulled in the kite and wound the spool around it. He collapsed the wings and folded it under his arm and they returned to the blanket.
  Lunch was grilled hamburgers, potato chips, and pickles. Suzanne had already poured them cups of sweet tea and had plates set out for each of them. They sat together and ate.
  "Daddy, can I have your pickle?"
  "Eat your own pickle."
  "I already ate it."
  He looked over and saw Joseph had already finished his pickle and chips. The burger remained untouched.
	"Boy, you gonna turn into a pickle one of these days, if you ain't careful."
  The boy laughed.
	"No I ain't, daddy!"
	"Go on then."
	Joseph reached over and eagerly picked up the pickle. He devoured it in just a few bites. The parent gave each other looks.
	"Suzanne!" he said, "Look at Joseph. Oh my God he's turnin green. He's turnin into a pickle!"
	"Oh no!"
	Joseph frowned. He examined his arms and legs then looked up grinning.
	"I ain't a pickle!"
	"Oh yes you are. Now I get to eat you!"
	He grabbed his son under the legs and swung him up and pretended to munch on him. Then he lifted his shirt and blew fart noises on his belly. Joseph laughed and laughed. He set him down and collapsed against his wife, who was leaning on her side. Joseph ran over and sat against his father and mother.
	"Finish that burger and we'll have a treat."
	As the boy picked at his food he nestled into his wife's bosom. Suzanne finished the cup of tea and lay back on the blanket, her head rested on her arm. She feathered his hair and pulled the strands behind his ears.
	"I need a hair cut."
	"Your hair is perfect."
	"That ain't true. I got a bald spot."
	"Your bald spot is perfect."
	He leaned up and kissed his wife on the neck. She kissed his forehead. They looked over and saw Joseph watching them. Joseph came over and lay beside them. The wind picked up and blew the plates into the grass. But no one got up. They laid there, close to one another and looked at the sky. The clouds were moving past. White, billowy clouds. Peaceful clouds. He wondered where they would end up. Those clouds.
	"Daddy?"
	"Yes?"
	"Remember when we were flying the kite?"
	"I do. It wasn't that long ago."
	"No, remember when we were flying the kite and I said it was almost in outer space?"
	"I do."
	"Can a kite go to outer space?"
	"I think so."
	"That's really high."
	"Oh yeah."
	"Where will it go then?"
	"What you mean?"
	"After outer space."
	"Nowhere. There ain't nowhere else."
	"I don't understand that."
	"It goes on forever."
  "How far is that?"
  "Very."
  "Can we go there?"
  "No."
  "Why not?"
  "I don't know. Ask your mother."
  But she was asleep, had fallen asleep listening to the wind blowing through the grass and the trees and also the birds which were chirping. And with their stomachs full the man and his son also fell asleep. They napped and woke an hour later. He woke first and looked at his son asleep on the blanket next to him. He listened to his wife's heartbeat and looked up and saw the sun behind a cloud, shining through.
  Then his wife woke and she wrapped her arm around him and pulled him closer.
  "Baby."
	"What?"
  "Them titties sure do make good pillows."
  "Thanks honey, that's sweet of you to say."
  They laughed and that woke Joseph. He opened his eyes and stared up at his mother and father and smiled.
  "Daddy."
  "Yes?"
  "I gotta pee."
  "Well go pee then."
  "Where do I go pee?"
  "By them trees, by the woods. Just walk over there and unzip, just make sure nobody sees your pecker."
  "Will."
  "What?"
  "Don't teach our son to say pecker."
	"Why not?"
	"It's uncouth."
	"I'll show you uncouth."
	He turned to face Suzanne and kissed her neck and behind the ears and placed his hand between her thighs, and felt the warmth there. They kissed. Slow and long and hard. Their tongues entwined. He reached his hand up her shirt and felt her body. That soft skin that always reminded him of when they were teenagers. He felt her breasts and the wetness between her legs. They didn't allow their lust to progress too far however, and eventually lay together, breathing deeply, in time.
	"Baby, we need a house."
	He knew that was coming. Their apartment was too small. Much too small to raise a family in. One bedroom, one bath. No yard.
  "After we see what happens with these layoffs at the plant and I know I still got a job. It'll have to wait till then."
	A scream. It was Joseph, far away.
	They got up.
  "Where did he go?"
  "To pee?"
  "How long ago was that?"
  "Fifteen minutes, half an hour, I'm not even sure."
  "Where did his voice come from? What direction?"
  "I don't know."
  "The woods?"
  "I don't know."
  Another scream came. He listened. There was crying in the direction of the woods. He took off that way. Suzanne followed behind him.
  "Joseph! I'm coming boy, don't worry."
  He entered the woods at a place where there was a narrow path. The pines grew close together, the floor covered in a blanket of straw.
  "Joseph, say something to daddy! I'm coming. I'm here."
  He stopped for a moment and listened over the beating of his heart. Soon a cry came from his right and he ran in that direction, between the thin, narrow trunks, the low branches hitting him in the face.
  The woods grew deeper, darker the further in he went. The sound of Joseph's voice came from there. In his mind were thoughts of snake bites, spider bites, cougars, bears. Visions of the the worst possible things came into his head. And guilt.
  "Joseph! Where are you?"
  And then he saw him, in the shadows of the woods, tangled in a briar patch, his jacket ripped on the thorns, his arms bleeding, his cheek scratched.
  "Stay still. I'll get you out. Don't move around."
  Joseph was crying. He was in pain. The thorns had cut him pretty bad. He saw all that as he got out his pocket knife and cut through the thick limbs. Finally he was free and they went to a clearing and he looked his son up and down. Only scratches. But he was shaking. He knelt and held his son close and felt his little body shaking in his arms. He didn't say anything. He held him close.
  After five minutes he picked up his son and carried him out of the woods. He called out to Suzanne that everything was okay. When they emerged she ran over and looked her son over. They carried him to the blanket. He went to the pickup and got some rags and tended to his wounds. His mother brought out the fried strawberry pies from the picnic basket and placed them on a paper plate. They sat together and ate the pies without talking. They each felt the breeze in their hair and the warm sunlight of the afternoon on their tired faces and soon enough Joseph leaned over and whispered into his father's ear to ask if they could fly the kite again.

"At any rate, I've had a good Russian cry over this poor fellow," she added, pointing to Myshkin, who did not even recognize her. "We've had enough of following our whims. It's time to be reasonable. And all this, all this life abroad, and this Europe of yours is all a fantasy, and all of us abroad are only a fantasy. Remember my words, you'll see it for yourself!" she concluded almost wrathfully, as she parted from Yevgeny Pavlovich.

  Headlights from the car shone onto a toppled shopping cart in the alleyway behind Huffaker Crossing, an abandoned strip mall where the Krogers used to be, where he liked to meet up with folks this side of town. *That Dodge makes enough racket to wake up the dead*, the man in the pickup thought. *Grady's kiddin himself if he thinks he'll ever restore that old piece of shit. Poor motherfucker*. The Dodge turned into the darkened area where his pickup truck sat idle and the beams entered the cabin and blinded him. He shielded his eyes as it pulled up. The headlights switched off but the motor was kept running, smoke curling from its tailpipe. As he waited, the man in the pickup listened to the patter of sleet on the rooftops and the moans of wind through the power lines overhead. He observed the paint flaking off the corners of the doors and the concrete pylons that shielded the air conditioning units, rust in those places. Everything was cast in amber hue, from a pole at the other end of the corridor. Behind the alleyway was a thin tree line, behind which was an unused railroad track and beyond that a trailer park of Mexicans.
  He had arrived nearly half an hour ago. He always did. There was a classic rock n roll tune called *Waiting for the Man* with a lyric that went, *first thing you learn is that you always got to wa-hait*. What horseshit. Nowadays it was. The way it was now, you get there before the other guy. Always. Scope things out, peer behind the bins and around all the corners. Under rocks. Everywhere. Be like a fiend yourself, paranoid. No doubt that was why he was still breathing while many others he knew of were not.
  The door to the pickup opened and in slid a woman and a man. 
  "Shut the goddamn door. Its fucking cold out here."
  The man slammed the door. The woman lit up a cigarette and opened the tray in the console. Between his legs the man held a backpack of unknown contents.
  "Will baby, how you been, darlin?"
  "Jenn."
  "Yo, what up Will. Thanks for meeting us so late."
  "Grady."
  Jenn ashed her cigarette in the tray. She was thin. As thin as he had ever seen her. Hair wiry, greasy. Fingernails bitten to the quick. Body odor. Skin ashen, pockmarked. And those teeth. Jesus Christ. He remembered a time she had been attractive. Beautiful even. Back then her hands didn't shake like that when she smoked. Back then there was light behind her eyes.
  "Dude, what you gave us last time was straight. We was trippin balls for like seven days, I swear to God!"
  He said nothing, only palmed the handgun in his left jacket pocket. Nodded. Then with his right hand he pulled out the eight ball, tied in a plastic baggie. Both their eyes went there, squinted.
  "Well there it is," Jenn said, "But here's the thing Will, this here is me and Grady's last score. We going straight edge. God as my witness."
  He didn't respond, only looked at them both.
  "Tell you something else," she continued, "That shit right there. That shit will kill you. Deader then hell. You bet your ass. It robs you of your life. It robs you of your kids. It don't care one iota. It robs you of everything. You oughta be ashamed to sell this to people. It’s devilish. It’s ungodly."
  "Shut the the fuck up, Jenn," Grady said, "man don't need a lecture."
  "Well I'm sorry, but you know me, I ain't got no filters. I just tell it like it is."
  "Three hundred."
  The tweakers looked at Will. Both nodded and then Jenn turned to Grady and gestured to the backpack in the floorboard.
  "Show him, babe."
  Grady reached down and unzipped the backpack. But as he did so Will pulled the gun from his jacket pocket and aimed the barrel at Grady.
  "Fuck you doing?"
  Grady raised both hands, palms out, innocent.
  "Bro, its cool. I swear."
  "Its just a notebook. That's all it is."
  He looked from Grady to Jenn. For a few moments in the pickup it was totally silent, except for the heater blower and a low song playing on the radio.
  "Let me explain, Will."
  He looked at Grady.
  "Man, basically its like this. Me and Jenn had a job tonight. On the down low if you know what I mean. They said we could take whatever shit we found, from the place, and we got this notebook and backpack. We won't be getting paid until next week for the job but figured we could get a ball from you, and maybe pay you with this notebook, which is worth a hell of a lot more than three hundred. That's for damn sure."
  He grew impatient with their stupidity, with their naive attempt to manipulate him. He snapped. "What the fuck do you mean notebook? Start making sense, or I don't know what I'll do."
  "I told you we should have asked him ahead of time, Grady."
  "Bullshit, Jenn! You told me we needed to wait, show him in person. Throw me under the bus, you fucking bitch!"
  "Don't call me a bitch, motherfucker. I'm the best thing you ever had in your life."
  "Hardly," Grady laughed.
  "Hand me the backpack."
  Grady looked at Will, then nodded. He reached for the bag.
  "Not you. Let Jenn do it."
  Jenn put down her cigarette. She reached for the bag.
  "Slower. I don't want to see your hand anywhere near the zipper."
  She slowed down, picked up the backpack by the shoulder straps and held it out to Will. He unzipped the bag with his free hand and reached inside and pulled out an aluminum computer, silver, in perfect condition.
  "A computer? Why didn't you just say so?"
  Grady shrugged.
  "Hell I don't know, I always call em notebooks. Ain't that what you call em?"
  "They're laptops babe."
  "Well you didn't help clarify anything before."
  "Fuck off, Jenn."
  "Don't tell me to fuck off, Grady. You don't talk to me like that!"
	"Shut the fuck up you two."
	They stopped cold and looked to Will. He said nothing. He handed the computer over to Grady.
	"Turn it on."
	Grady lifted the lid, pushed a button and the screen turned on, the keyboard lit up, and the fans started blowing.
	"It takes a few minutes to get crunk up. But it's a real nice one, as you can see. No scratches or dings or nothin. This thing you could sell on Craigslist for a thousand bucks. A thousand easy. We looked it up online."
  "But then we got to thinking," Jenn stepped in, her voice softening, "to save time, what if you just let us give it to you in exchange for a ball? Then you could make a ton off just this one score. Just this one time, you know."
  Grady interrupted, selling it.
  "It works good, see, we tested it out. Its even got some battery left. Got all the wires, in the bag there."
  The login screen lit up the inside of the cabin, a green leafy background. Grady typed in a few keys to show that it worked. A message popped up that the password was incorrect.
  He put the handgun pack into his jacket pocket and reached over and grabbed the computer. It was heavy in his hand. Solidly  built. Brand new from the looks of it.
  "So whatddya think?" Jenn asked, with such brazen confidence that Grady shot her a look.
  Will said nothing. He merely regarded them both with skeptical eyes and ran his fingers along the outside and over the keyboard and then closed the lid and weighed it in hand.
  
  Inside, he set the backpack on the desk and walked to the kitchenette carrying a sackful of Krystals. He pulled a pint of Wild Turkey from the top of the fridge and poured two fingers into a dirty glass, added an ice cube, and then fell back onto the bed with the drink and the burgers, flipping through the basic cable stations that came with the room.
  After he was stuffed and his was head spinning. He knew in the morning he would regret eating these gut bombs so late. But fuck it. He stumbled to the kitchenette and poured another and began pacing the hotel room. Someday soon he would be out of this. Then he might be able to regain some kind of control, might move out of this shithole and get a regular place again, a real place. Get a dog. He thought about what Grady and Tina were doing in this moment, their minds obliterated on the drugs, there on the couch in their shit trailer out in Kingston. Obliterated but in love. He remembered how he had once been in love. In that moment his stomach turned and he ran into the bathroom and chucked burgers and whisky into the toilet. It was this place, the filth, the cigarette smoke. Always the stale smell of it. He rose from the toilet, wiped his mouth and brushed his teeth and washed his face and looked at himself in the mirror.
  Back in the kitchenette he poured another drink. The clock read four thirty. In a few hours it would be daylight and impossible anymore for him to sleep. The curtains were no good, there was a big area at the sides where the sunlight came in brighter than all hell. So he would be tired all tomorrow. He walked to the window overlooking the parking lot. In the office on the other side he saw the fluorescent lights on, the little Indian man who ran the hotel awake, drinking coffee. He was a hard worker. He reminded him a bit of Nanda, a man he used to work with at Beaulieu before they shut the doors in 2009. He had worked the extruder there for going on fifteen years. Had seniority, was always asked to train the new guys moving up from the floor. Nanda was on the sanitation team and they used to see each other all the time in the break room, do the old routine,
  "How's it hanging, Nanda?"
  The little guy then adjusted his crotch.
  "Little to the left today, Will" he would answer, "Thanks for asking, my friend."
  Beaulieu was also where he met up with Glenn, who he used to go  out camping with up in Mentone, near Little River Canyon. Glenn was the one who introduced him to Danny, who sold him weed for their camping trips. And now he worked for Rodriguez from Kennesaw, who supplied Danny and now him. That's how it happens. And one time getting robbed at gunpoint during a Craigslist meet up. Whole stash took, just one time, and Rodriguez goes from friendly to fierce. It's just business, he tells me. That's just the way it goes. In the hole for 100K. I'll never be free from this life.
  Out the window he saw a van swerve into the lot and park sideways on the side opposite of his room. Two black men got out and went to door 104 and banged on it with their fists. The curtain in the room opened and then the door cracked but with the safety latch in place. One of the men stood back and kicked the door in. Then the both of them rushed inside and beat the shit out of the man inside. He assumed it was a man, all he saw was them huddled over some dark shape, punching and kicking, furiously. A girl appeared in the door and shouted for help. The men rose and pushed her into the room, and then left. His eyes went to the Indian in the office, who was looking in the direction of the room, on the phone. The men came out, breathing hard, got in the car, and sped off. The entire thing didn't last more than a few minutes. He could see the man inside writhing on the floor, the girl hovering over him.
  He was far from it. Only dimly did he hear the sirens of the ambulance when it arrived. Everything was unreal. The room was spinning, so he sat down on the hard chair and put his head in his hands, but that only made the spinning worse. He wretched again and came back and lay on the bed. Thoughts of Suzanne and his old life, camping with Glenn, high as a kite and talking shit about the existence of God, his old job at the carpet mill. His boy.
  His eyes went to the television on the dresser. It was the news, a replay of the eleven o clock news. There had been an explosion at a research lab at the local college. Helicopter footage of the building in flames, charred debris at the windows and doorways, completely destroyed. No survivors the newswoman said. They showed pictures of them. Young, grad students. Then there was a cutaway to some video footage outside the place, a closeup of Grady and Jenn, carrying a gasoline can and other tools into the building. He rose from the bed but the dizziness caused him to fall off. He got to his feet and slapped himself and tried to pay attention but he was too drunk, the details were slipping by him. Then there was some grainy footage of a Dodge Dart driving off, the tail lights and smoke unmistakable. Then there was a number at the bottom of the screen to call for any information. Then the story was over and they moved on to the weather.
  His went to the computer on the dresser. He lifted the lid and turned it on. Once again he looked at the account avatar, the cute graphic of a DNA strand, and a username, z.jackson. It was password protected.
  From the corner of his eye he saw the red and blue flashing lights behind the curtain and in his drunken state he was startled by them. He knelt low and crawled to the window, peering out. It was only then he remembered the beating and the ambulance. Now two patrol cars were also in the parking lot, a group of them talking near room 104. He rose to his feet and saw others in other rooms watching, like him. There was a flash from a camera and he saw one of the officers putting a cell phone back into his pocket, facing him. The girl was crying, crossing her arms in the cold, giving a statement to one of the police. The other police in the group leered from the corners of their eyes. All she wore was a thin silk gown. In this cold. He found himself also fixated on the shape of the woman, on her breasts through the gown, on her nipples through the silk. He remembered the first time he kissed Suzanne, Spring break in Panama City Beach. He worked up the courage and asked her to walk the fishing pier with him. She said yes. After they went dancing. He was not the dancing type but he liked to dance with her. They walked down to the beach and he took a chance and kissed her slowly on the cheek, awkwardly. They dropped to the sand and he kissed her neck and looked up and saw her eyes closed in ecstasy. He lifted her shirt and kissed her smooth, pale stomach, lifted her bra and kissed her breasts. Then he kissed her deeply and could still remember how their embrace felt, close, as if two souls were holding onto the other at the edge of an abyss. He thought of their time together, then years later, just after the delivery of their son. It hurt him to think of his son.
  The police were gone. The door to room 104 was closed. The woman in the silk robe nowhere to be seen. Just over the roof of the hotel the sky was fading from night to dim, pinkish gray. Morning commuters in traffic on the road beside the hotel. His head had stopped spinning at last but his mind was far from clear. His eyes landed on the pool in the center of the parking lot, unkept, unused in years, covered with a tarp partially blown open. Green, stagnant water lapped at the sides of the once ocean blue lining, now a hard plastic white. The sight of it took him to a vacation with his dad and brother and sister, to Fernandina beach when they were just kids. Though they had never seen the ocean they were more excited about the pool at the hotel and their dad reluctantly agreed to let them leave the beach to go there for the afternoon. How clearly he could still remember the smell of that water and the bright orange arm floats his little brother wore, only five. The brown siding of the hotel, the bright blue against it, looking up. The white clouds. It was all there as if it were yesterday, funny how clearly he could still recall that time and even smell it. Then a feeling inside of how far he was from those days, at how happy he had been then, at how fun it all was and how his life would never again been so much fun. He thought about his son and if he would remember him as he remembered his own father and that was the last thing he thought before sleep took him.

 He awoke with his head at the foot of the bed, under every bit of blanket and sheets there were. No pillow. He slept that direction to be closer to the heater. Using his left arm as a pillow had cut off its circulation. He moved his arm for several minutes before the pinpricks faded. He had slept hard in the night and had not dreamed. There had been a heaviness to his sleep that was hard to shake off, hard to keep his eyes open. It was not just the whiskey, though it didn't help. The TV was still on. Such was his dreamy state of mind, one second the room was silent then the next he heard the sound of it blaring, a particularly obnoxious commercial about breakfast cereal. He lay there and listened, his eyes still too heavy to get out of the bed. Soon he heard the news, a beautiful Latina voice reading the local headlines from the Atlanta metro area.

  "Top story this morning, we have updates on the break-in and subsequent explosion, which occurred last night at a technology research center on the Berry College campus in North Georgia. Footage was recovered which showed an old car speeding through the security gate at 11:05 pm. The car drove to the research center and two suspects emerged with garden tools and a can of gasoline. They broke into the building, as seen on this footage, by smashing the glass doors, triggering the alarm. Ten minutes later they emerge from the building, carrying unidentified objects, and speed away. Approximately 11:37 pm an explosion occurs in the east side of the building, and slowly spreads until it is visible on the security tape, here. It was thought originally the building was empty, but we have confirmation from school security there was a single student logged into the building, apparently working late, and so far authorities have not been able to locate this student. We have approval from local police to show an image of the student, who has been identified as Zoey Jackson, a graduate student in the computer science program at the college."
	
  He arose and watched the story intently, the recollection of the news from last night coming back to him, slowly, vaguely. His blurred vision focused on the image of the student, a nice looking black girl, smirking, the mugshot-like quality of the photograph obviously from her student identification.
  
  "Ms. Jackson has so far not been found, nor reached by contact information on school records. Police have begun a search for Ms. Jackson and would like us to provide a phone number where you may call anonymously to provide information, about this incident. If you do have information, either regarding the whereabouts of Ms. Jackson or the two perpetrators, please call the number at the bottom of the screen. In other news..."
  
   It came back to him, how he had recognized the unmistakable tail lights of that old Dodge in his drunken state last night. But then there was just a blank. Nothing. He remembered nothing else. But it was them. Who else would drive such a piece of shit? And then it hit him. He shook off the remnants of sleep and went to the table by the window. There on the table was the notebook, the computer Grady and Jenn had convinced him to trade for the drugs last night. He opened the lid and turned it on. The login screen came up and he recognized the username from last night, z.jackson.
   He shut the lid and went to his phone. It lay next to the bag of half-eaten Krystals, now crawling with roaches, feeding on the dried onions and mustard. "No. No. Fuck no," he said, and then let out another tortured *Fuck no* when he saw his last text to Grady,
   
  the fuck did this computer come from? u r on 11 news! txt me back soon
   
  He looked at the text in disbelief and finally tossed it on the bed. He paced the room for the next fifteen minutes, stopping only to vomit in the toilet, a combination of nerves and the hangover. He poured some water from the bathroom faucet and drank it down. His mouth was dry and now slimed and the cold water washed away the acid taste. He went to the window and peaked out, the parking lot during the day emptied out as the out-of-town construction workers and electricians went to work. Nobody was outside. He saw the woman who worked the day shift in the office, on the phone. Then he turned back to the room.
  He went to the bathroom and pulled down a rag hung over the shower rod, wet it and returned to the computer. He wiped it down, picking it up with a t-shirt, both inside and out. Then he placed it in the Krystal bag and tied a knot. Roaches escaped and scurried behind the mirror. He put on his jacket and beanie and took another peak out the window. Nobody. He grabbed his wallet and keys and went out the door.
  Outside he turned to the right, where an old busted washer and drier sat unused. Then the ice machine, which was. The only thing past the machines was a small empty yard behind the office and a chainlink fence marking the boundary of property. He went towards the yard, around the end of the building and turned a corner to the right. This led him to the alley behind the rooms, a narrow dirt path parallel to the fence, woods behind. Now the bathroom window of all the rooms overlooked this alley, so he knelt low and crept as fast as he could with the bag in hand, all the way down.
  At the other end of the building, around that corner, was a brown garbage bin. There was a thin row of pines separating the bin from the road, sidewalk, morning traffic going by. The bin was closed from this side, since everybody used the more convenient side facing the hotel entrance. But he wanted to remain unseen. He waited and then when he was sure nobody was around he crept up beneath the back of the bin. He slid open the backside and tossed in the bag then closed it. Then he went back the way he came, the same way he went before, creeping, quiet.
  He got in his pickup and looked at the text once again. He nearly picked up the phone to call Grady, then thought better of that. He nearly sent a text, then realized just how stupid he was being. He pumped the gas a couple times then turned the ignition. He let it warm up then pulled out and headed down Martha Berry then up the bypass, towards Kingston.
  The local station was playing music, top 40, interrupting only for weather updates, more cold, black ice on bridges, but no news about the break-in. No panic. He kept a close watch in his mirrors for any police. He was taking a chance but the data on that phone was incriminating. He was sure it was a burner, he didn't deal with folks who didn't have one, but as long as it was on their person it could incriminate him. And that could not happen. He went the long way, around Ward mountain, instead of the more direct route. He came up Price Road where he knew there was a dirt utility road leading into the woods which surrounded the trailer park where they lived. He drove up and down the road a couple times, to lookout for any police, any suspicious vehicles. Nothing. It was still soon. Good he acted when he did.
  He turned into the utility road and navigated the deep ruts and icy mud holes until he was well hidden amongst the pines. He tucked the gun into his jacket pocket and got out. He made a best guess which way into the woods would lead him to their trailer. He had only been there once, years ago, when he and Grady were drinking buddies and not customer client. The dried leaves made so much noise as he shuffled into the woods he wondered if this was a better idea than just driving up. He did his best and tried not to shuffle as best he could.
  Gusts of wind blew through the pines. He stopped and leaned against a tree. In the clearing he spied the backside of a trailer. He kept walking. Soon he emerged from the wood line, creeping along the edge of it, where he would hopefully remain unseen. Down towards the cul-de-sac he recognized the faded yellow siding on Grady and Jenn's single wide, behind which was a shoddy porch and natural gas tank. Pulled into the trees nearby was the old Dodge, well hidden by broken branches and leaves piled on top. He went up the steps of the back porch.
  Through the back window he saw the stove overhead light on, fast food wrappers on the counter, though sunlight beamed through the living room window, next to the entertainment center, a cheap shelf with a small flat screen TV on top, The Wizard of Oz playing on it. No signs of Grady and Jenn. No signs at all. He drew his gun and knelt beside the door, then rapped twice with his knuckles, quietly. A minute passed, he knocked again, louder this time. Waited. Two more minutes, nothing.
  He thought to text Grady, let him know he was back there. He thought they might be hiding. It's possible they were on the run, but knowing them, not likely. He banged on the door with his fist, waited a minute, and heard nothing. On the left end of the trailer was a small bedroom window. He crept around and climbed onto a rusted-out riding lawnmower underneath it. Cupping his hands around the pane he tried to make out what was inside, but it was too dark. With no affordance from the outside to lift the window he pushed up against it with his palms and after a few moments of steady force it creaked up a few inches.
  His left foot came down on a toy box made of cardboard. It sunk under his weight but held enough for him to get the footing he needed to heave his body through the narrow opening. His back  scraped against the metal frame and hurt like hell, but he remained silent, pulling his right leg through the window and setting down gently on the floor. There were toys piled here. A crib stuffed with boxes. Diapers in the corner. A moon and star mobile still hanging from one of the panels in the ceiling, glittering in the light from the still open window. Wooden blocks strewn on the floor and he stepped around them as he approached the door to listen.
  Silence. 
  He stood there for a few minutes, waiting for any kind of sound, movement, voices, whatever. The last thing he wanted was to frighten a tweaked-out fiend in his own house. But he had to get Grady to erase that text message. It was the only way to ensure he wouldn't get caught up whatever mess they had gotten themselves into. He breathed in deeply and turned the knob and opened the door just a few inches. This door led to a bathroom on the right and a narrow hallway into the kitchen and living room.
  "Grady? Jenn? This is Will. You guys at home?"
  No answer. He waited a bit longer and then opened the door and went into the hallway. He crouched as he emerged.
  "This is Will. I just want to see if you guys are home."
  Slowly he rose. On the floor in the area leading to the bathroom a massive pile of clothes and spare engine parts was blocking his way. He crept around it and continued down the hallway. The hallway was dark, lined with picture frames of their family. Very old ones black and white ones of who he supposed were their parents in their high school days. Then a larger one, a Sears family portrait of Grady and Jenn with their two kids between them, dressed in their Sunday finest. Tasteful blue background. They looked much different then.
  As he came into the kitchen the smell of garbage overwhelmed his sense of smell. Something rotten. Trash overflowed from the can beside the oven onto the floor. The sink was filled with dirty dishes. The refrigerator door was partly opened, cool air leaking out. He passed the backdoor he had looked through earlier as he entered the living room. There was an ashtray on the coffee table, filled with ashes and a few broken glass pipes and cigarette butts. Next to it was the eight ball, opened.
  The front door was locked with a chain. The door to the master bedroom was on the other side of the living room. It was half closed. Nobody was here. He nearly sent a text to Grady but decided to check the last room, just in case they were passed out.
  "Grady? Jenn? This is Will. Just checking in on you guys. This is Will. Hello?"
  He walked to the door to the master bedroom and pushed it open. On the walls and on the dresser and the window against the wall he saw red splatter. So much of it. He stumbled backwards and pushed the doorknob through the cheap drywall. On the bed lay what remained of Grady and Jenn, but it was only from their clothes that he could identify them. Their bodies were mutilated beyond recognition, floating in a stagnant pool of their own blood. The fluids and viscera went up to the walls and even speckled the ceiling.
  He covered his mouth and went to the living room. He fell onto the couch and tried to keep from retching. The smell and the sight of the horror kept repeating in his brain. He took in deep breaths. But a few moments he rose and started to look around for the cell phone. He looked everywhere, on the end table, on the coffee table, on the chairs, between the cushions. In the kitchen. Nowhere. He stopped momentarily and looked deep in thought. In reality he was psyching himself for what he knew he had to do. He took a few more breaths and went back to the master bedroom. He covered his mouth as he tried to find the pockets in their clothes, also shredded to the point of un-recognition. He retched a few times but as he had not eaten since last night nothing came out. His hands were now stained red. Nothing found.
  At last he could take no more and ran out again and sat on the recliner facing the TV. He watched the loop of Dorothy walking the fence, Toto just behind, then the Tin Man dancing, then the Scarecrow doffing his hat, the Lion cowering, the entrance to the Emerald City, the  Wizard behind the curtain, a closeup of the ruby slippers. His cell phone vibrated in his front pocket and his heart felt like it was going to jump out of his mouth, "Jesus Christ Almighty, Fuck me in the Ass! Fuck you!"
  He took a few deep breaths and then reached in his pocket. He did not want to look at the phone. It was a text message, he knew that from the vibration. It could be anybody. It could be a customer. It could be Rodriguez. They were the ones who had this number. They were the only ones. He flipped over the phone. It was a text from Grady,
  
  We need the notebook you have. Please stay put.
  
  He sat back down on the couch. He chewed his lip and then wondered why he was doing that. It was not something he normally did, chewing. He looked at his arms and legs and it was like he was looking at someone else. Then some thoughts started to come to the forefront of his mind. One was notebook, the word notebook for the computer. And the other was 'Please stay put'. It was very, polite. Respectful even. That did not reconcile with the image of Grady and Jenn in the master bedroom, an image he would never forget. But then, after he got over the seeming politeness of the request he started to think about what it implied. Did they know where he was? And then, how did they know?
  He went to the front window and peered out of the blinds. From  here you could see clear to the top of the hill, to the dirt road that went through the trailer park. And then he saw a car, an Oldsmobile from the eighties, Burgundy in color and boxy styled, zooming over the hill, spewing dust and rocks into the air.
  The back door flung open and he darted down the steps and ran as fast as he could into the woods. In this state of mind all he could remember was the general direction of where he parked, so that's where he went. He passed trees and kicked up leaves and was making so much noise that he was sure anyone who was listening could easily hear him. But still that seemed preferable to what would happen if they caught him.
  Now in the distance he heard voices, at the door. Talking to themselves, listening to hear what direction he was running. Then shouts. He kept running. He looked back for just a moment but when he turned back he was staring down a tree in his path. He had just enough time to swerve to the left but still his shoulder grazed the lowest hanging limb. The gun fell from his hand and vanished into a pile of dry leaves. He had no time to stop to recover it. He thought he heard besides his loud shuffling the sounds of others. Still he ran, zigging in this direction and zagging in the other. More shouting. How many were there? It sounded like a lot of them.
  Then he found the open area where his pickup was parked and jumped inside. He fumbled with the keys and started the engine. As he put the truck in gear he heard more shouting nearby. He spun the truck around in reverse and put it in drive a little too soon. He drove right into a drainage ditch and collided with the opposite wall. Immediately he flung the pickup in reverse and backed out. The wheels spun for a few seconds but then grabbed hold. He heard more shouts.
  He put it in drive one more time and sped towards the dirt road leading to the main road.

  The setting sun glanced over the roof of the downtown library, casting long shadows over the cars in the parking lot. He pulled into a spot near the back. It was a hidden spot next to a paved trail that ran alongside the Etowah River. Too risky to park at the hotel. Maybe they had seen the truck during the escape. He took off down the trail. Oak leaves tumbled around his boots. A winter wind. The river was high. Muddy. It would be dark soon. That was what he wanted. He made his way underneath the overpass, winding to the south, to a rusted bridge unused since the new one opened up a few years ago. In fact it was blocked off by a barricade. He jumped the barricade and ran to the other side of the river. Then he walked a few blocks and crossed a few intersections until he was on the road behind the hotel, or what he thought was that road. He wasn't sure but kept going. When he arrived to the hotel he slowed down and walked casually up to his room and unlocked the door. 
  The room was ransacked. The mattress was flipped on its side next to the bed and shredded with a knife, stuffing hanging out. The dresser drawers were all pulled, his belongings strewn on the floor. Same in the kitchenette. Everything that could close was opened. Contents everywhere. Silverware, plates, leftover food, papers from his divorce, the restraining order. Everything. He went to the door and fastened the chain latch and turned the deadbolt. Not that it would do much good. On the back of the door in pink magic marker he read a message, possibly from some prostitute to another, *Don't forget to lock the door, honey!!!*, the dots on the exclamation points were smiley faces.
  He stood near the window and parted the curtains just enough to see into the parking lot. It was twilight and hard to make anything out, but headlights from the five o clock traffic gave him enough light to do a survey. There were late-model sedans, work trucks, a jeep, but near the back he saw a boxy-shaped vehicle and was reminded of the Oldsmobile from the trailer park. Not many of those on the road anymore. He saw smoke from the tailpipe and what he thought were two dark silhouettes inside. He stared at that car for a minute but saw no movement or indication they were watching his room. He closed the curtain. He sat down on the bed and nearly called the police but thought better of that. Instead he turned on the TV. He wanted to see the six news.
  
  "Top Story tonight. Police have confirmed two murdered bodies found in a Kingston trailer park to be the suspects in the break-in and fire which occurred at the research facility on the college campus last night. Police were notified of the bodies by an anonymous phone call this afternoon. The deceased have been identified as Grady and Jenn Upton of Kingston. Related, police have identified the body pulled from the remains of the research facility to be that of Zoey Jackson, a graduate student who was the only person on log to be inside the facility during the time of the break-in. Investigators have asked anyone who has information about the break-in or murders to please contact police headquarters with any information. We'll put a phone number on the screen below. Is it there? Good. Thanks Jim. Moving on, the Riverside Square and Folk Dance Festival is headed to Ridge Ferry park this weekend, and organizers want to know, Are you ready for the Hootenanny?"
  
  He sat on the bed. He couldn't breathe. It was supposed to be automatic but somewhere over the last few minutes his body had forgotten about that responsibility. He took some deep breaths in, but couldn't escape this feeling of suffocation, of drowning. He thought about the computer in the bin outside. He wondered if it were still there. As much as he'd like to forget all of this, he was in it, and the more info he had the more likely he would be to make it out alive. Just like a drug deal.
  He switched on the lamp and wiped his face with his hands. He thought deeply for several minutes, completely still. Then got up. First he went to the bathroom window and wedged the screwdriver where it couldn't be opened. He was sure if they were watching then they would be watching the alleyway behind this place. So it was off limits. He turned off the lamp so that it was completely dark in the room. He picked up the phone in the room and started to dial, but then the cell phone in his pocket vibrated. He put the phone back on the receiver and pulled the cell phone from his pocket.
  
  We need the notebook
 
  No response for a couple minutes. He was about to put the phone back in his pocket when another message arrived.
  
  Please stay put
  
  He tossed the phone on the bed and picked up the room phone. He dialed and closed his eyes, took a deep breath.
  "911, what is your emergency?"
  "Yes, there is a room fire at the Relax Inn on Martha Berry. The fire is at room 115 and its spreading fast. Please send firetrucks. There are injuries also."
  A moment later.
  "Okay sir, fire trucks are enroute to Relax Inn on Martha Berry. Can you tell me who is injured and what are their injuries? Please stay on the line with me as long as you can, until paramedics arrive on scene."
  He hung up.
  Minutes later he could hear the sirens coming down Martha Berry and then saw the red and white flashing lights reflecting off the fast food joint across the street. Then a firetruck and ambulance pulled into the hotel parking lot, followed by two police cars, red and blue lights flashing, reflecting off the rooms and the glass windows. People emerged with concerned faces. He waited for his chance. When enough firefighters and EMTs and police officers were deployed with their gear, when enough hotel occupants filled the parking lot, he made a dash for it.
  He opened the door to his room and crept along the walkway in the direction of the garbage bin at the end of the row. He reached the edge and went around the corner, in the dark, where he would not be seen. He rose and opened the sliding metal door of the bin. It had not been picked up but there was much more trash inside than earlier. It smelled bad. He took a breath and pulled himself up and disappeared into the bin.
  He fished in between the bags of trash and loose wet trash of mysterious origin and eventually found the computer. It was covered in some kind of slime he hoped hadn't corrupted the internals of the machine. But then he heard noises just outside and stopped.
  He listened and thought he heard shuffling on the ground around the bin, whispers, but he wasn't sure. If they were watching maybe they had seen him even in the confusion of his emergency distraction. He waited. There were two openings to the bin, one facing the parking lot, the one he had entered, and another facing the opposite way, towards the small pine trees behind the place. He picked up a large, heavy bag and positioned himself so that he could be facing the opening towards the parking lot with the other directly behind him.
  And then he heaved the large bag out the opening and it landed with a solid thud on the pavement. Immediately he saw two dark figures pounce on it from the side and without a moment of hesitation he jumped backwards and leapt out of the back opening and scrambled into the pack of pine trees up the hill. He heard them behind him and heard their shouts, even a shrill kind of shriek that filled him with primal dread. Whoever they were they were not just doing a job. They were filled with rage.
  He slipped on a slick bed of pine straws and felt a hand on his ankle grab hold. He kicked backwards with all his strength while simultaneously heaving upwards on his palms and elbows. He made contact and heard a groan and was on his feet.
  At the top of the hill he spotted a 24-hour lab and clinic and decided that may be the safest place to be at the moment. He tucked the computer under his arm and ran down the other side of the hill into the parking lot of the clinic. The parking lot was almost empty. The sign for the clinic was bright white and red and made him feel exposed. But there was the automatic door under the sign reading Immediate Care and he ran towards it.
  Across the marble floor of the lobby his dirty boots squeaked, echoing down the long hallways to his left and right. He had been here before years ago and knew the elevators were down the right hallway. He went that way. This late in the day there was nobody present, not even at the customer service desk. He ran to the elevators and found the door leading to the stairs. Up he went to the second floor and burst through the door. He wasn't sure how far they were behind but didn't want to take a chance.
  Upstairs were the offices for specialists, orthopedic, oncology, ENT, but also the radiology lab. There were a few workers in the hallway, wearing navy blue scrubs, carrying clipboards, pushing carts. People still waiting for test results. One old lady sat unattended in the hallway. She eyed him suspiciously as he brushed past. His frantic energy and disheveled appearance started to draw attention from the employees. They gave significant glances to one other. A receptionist in oncology reached for the phone. He heard the elevator ding and panicked. He darted into the nearest door.
  Once inside he closed the door and held it. The receptionist in the x-ray lab stood up, puzzled.
  "Sir, you can't close that door. It needs to remain open at all times."
  When he faced her she could see he was in no mood to argue. She picked up the phone, pushed a button, and spoke into it, never once breaking eye contact with him. He left the door and ran from the waiting area to the patient area, behind a large wooden door opened with a flat metal button at waist level.
  By now all the workers had been notified an erratic man was in side the building. They stood facing him, unmoving. He pushed through the doorway and went to the corner most room, the x-ray room. Here there was a machine with a platform base and two enormous arms. On the wall nearby was an observation window and a corner where the technician sat. He walked to the observation room. There was a older woman sitting at the computer. She looked up at him through reading glasses, a pen in her hand. Calmly she spoke to him, rising to her feet.
  "Sir, you won't get any drugs here. This is an x-ray lab. Are you sick? We can get you help."
  In his current state of mind it took him a few moments to register what the technician was telling him.
  "Give me your pen."
  "Sir?"
  "I said give me your pen. The one in your hand. I fucking need it. They are coming."
  "Sir, there is nobody here except us. Nobody is coming. I can't give you anything you might hurt yourself or others with. Why don't you follow me into the waiting room?"
  He exploded.
  "Give me the fucking pen you bitch!"
  He pried it from her hand and ran to the far corner of the room. She screamed and ducked under the desk in fear. Others entered the room. When they saw him with the pen they stopped.
  He set the computer on a counter, removed the cell phone from his pocket and found Grady's phone number in the menu using only his left hand. With his right he wrote the number on his arm. He then tossed the phone on the ground and picked up a metal container from the counter. He brought it down hard on the phone repeatedly, smashing it to bits.
  "Angie," one of the men shouted to the technician cowering under the desk, "Security is on the way. Don't worry. They'll be here soon."
  At that moment the man took a look at his surroundings. He saw the workers at the door, frightened but firm. He saw himself, brandishing the technician's pen like a madman. It was like he was in a movie, like he was watching a movie, removed from the danger or the implications of his actions. But at the same time he knew it was reality. At that moment he caught onto what the man had just said, *Security is on the way*, and understood that it wasn't to protect him from the dark figures who were chasing him. It was to protect all these innocent people from him.
  He then gripped the pen in one hand like a knife, tucked the computer under his other arm, and slashed at the air in front of him, rushing the crowd at the door. They ducked to the corners and he rushed through them into the hallway. He was sure security would be coming up the stairs and went to the platform which overlooked the lobby. It was a good twenty five foot drop.  He heard shouts from down the hallway, shut his eyes momentarily for strength, and heaved himself over the guard rail.
  He landed hard on the marble floor, his ankle twisted, and he collapsed into a ball. It hurt. Really bad. He was dazed but got up anyway and stumbled towards the entrance. Once outside he limped to the back of the facility, where there were no lights. Once in the dark he caught his breath and collected his thoughts and set off towards the library, cursing the stupidity of his injury and limping like a wounded animal.
  By the time he reached the library it was almost seven, which was when the library closed this day of the week. He was tired, sweaty despite the dropping temperature, and hurt. When he entered the library the woman at the front desk reminded him they would be closing soon. He nodded and smiled with as much normality as he could muster and went to the winding stairway that led to the second level where the fiction section was. Once at the top he went to the back, where there was a restroom. He knew this because he used to come here often to pick up books for Suzanne, who was a voracious reader, unlike him.
  In the restroom he washed his face in the sink, looked at himself in the mirror, took a few deep breaths, and then went into the furthest stall at the back. He set the computer on a diaper changing station in the stall and then climbed onto the seat of the toilet, wincing from the pain. And he waited.
  After some minutes, maybe half an hour, the door opened and a listless female voice shouted into the bathroom.
  "Anybody in here? We're closing now."
  The lights went out and then she was gone.
  He waited for another half hour, then got down. His legs were asleep and so he had to shake them for a few minutes. His hurt ankle was starting to swell. He went to the door and opened it just enough to be able to listen. He heard nothing. He came out and walked down the steps into the lobby. Though the main lights were out there were still random small lights on to see by. He walked through the periodicals, through the nonfiction sections, to the back of the building where the computers with internet access were. He walked rows and rows of old books and wondered how long some of them had sat there unread. The smell reminded him of summer days when his mother brought him here.
  When he reached the computer station he found a good spot with a table nearby and set to work. He connected the computer to a power outlet and turned it on. The familiar green login screen appeared, with the pre-filled username, z.jackson. He thought of the newscast he had seen earlier. The woman who had used this computer, which contained some extremely valuable information, was dead. The two fiends who had stolen this computer were also dead, mutilated in fact, and now he was being followed for this computer. He had to figure out how to get into it and learn why it was so valuable. That seemed to him the only way to understand how best to leverage his position. He was no fool.
  He switched on the terminal closest to him and when it booted he did a search on how to bypass the login screen on an Apple computer, crossing his fingers. He was not at all computer savvy but knew there were those out there who were, and he could follow directions as much as any red-blooded American. The very first result gave him what he needed. He rebooted the computer and hit command+r to enter Recovery Mode. Then he selected Utilities->Terminal and when the Terminal opened he typed *resetpassword*. This launched the Reset Password utility dialog where he was able to select the z.jackson account and change the password. He changed it to *370Price*, his old address and rebooted the machine. He was in.

  The user interface faded in and a row of application icons popped up from the bottom of the screen. But the most interesting thing was the desktop wallpaper. It seemed to be a faded polaroid taken at a child's birthday party, from the early 80s going by the hairstyles and the clothes they wore. In the middle of the photo was a little girl wearing a pink dress, sitting at a small table in front of a house. She was surrounded by her parents on either side and she was blowing out a candle, which was still lit in this photograph. All around the table were children, clapping their hands, and presumably parents of those children looking on, smiles on their faces.
  Not knowing where to begin he found a folder called Documents and started opening files at random, looking for any clue as to why the computer was so important.

Zoey, it has come to my attention that you have approached several lab subjects with an offer to participate in an unauthorized research project called Aura. I would like to understand the nature of this research, to review any and all documentation you have thus far, and most importantly to get an explanation why you felt no need to notify me or any other manager to get permission use these facilities for your own research (which I remind you belongs to the Andromeda Group, based on section 41-B of the employee contract). Please see me in my office when you arrive and bring along the requested documents. Also your work computer.

Thank you,

PinkHatGirl: oh
PinkHatGirl: what is relevant?
ShoelessJoel: Well... why are you in this site?
ShoelessJoel: You don't look like you need a place like this to find people...
PinkHatGirl: for random sex of course
PinkHatGirl: jk!
ShoelessJoel: Ok... you got me there for a second!
PinkHatGirl: but I do need this place, I never meet cool guys
ShoelessJoel: So... what is it? Maybe you don't have any time to socialize in real life?
PinkHatGirl: do you know any?
ShoelessJoel: You're talking to the coolest guy in town!
PinkHatGirl: I thought I might be, the arm tattoo tipped me off
PinkHatGirl: are you kidding I work all the time
ShoelessJoel: If I sound dull it's just 'cause I had a long day at work today...
PinkHatGirl: what are you here for?
PinkHatGirl: oh, what do you do?
ShoelessJoel: I'm just getting my mind off suicidal thoughts...
ShoelessJoel: But I'm fine! talking to you makes it better.
PinkHatGirl: oh no, I hope you’re joking
ShoelessJoel: I work at a shoe factory.... putting pieces together...
ShoelessJoel: It's boring as hell but it pays my livin'
ShoelessJoel: How 'bout you?
PinkHatGirl: hmm
PinkHatGirl: any shoes I might recognize?
PinkHatGirl: I work in a research lab
ShoelessJoel: It's classified...
ShoelessJoel: Cool! Sounds way more interesting than my story
ShoelessJoel: What's it about?
PinkHatGirl: oh really? so is my work but I won’t tell if you won’t
ShoelessJoel: Ladies first! 😜
ShoelessJoel: The factory I work for makes bowling shoes... and tap dancing ones...  weird combo, I know...
PinkHatGirl: this is going to sound ridiculous but I swear it’s real, we’re doing research to experiment how to control software by thoughts
ShoelessJoel: Already?!
ShoelessJoel: Sounds like a sci-fi movie
PinkHatGirl: it’s an honest to goodness field, look up neuroimaging electrophysiology sometime
ShoelessJoel: You look very young... how old are you?
PinkHatGirl: I like bowling
PinkHatGirl: not sure about tapdancing
ShoelessJoel: I like neuroimaging neurophysuiiiology😜
PinkHatGirl: it’s on my profile, 28
PinkHatGirl: haha, it turns on all the boys
ShoelessJoel: Almost 30! You look 20!
PinkHatGirl: it really can be like sci fi
ShoelessJoel: I know... science nerds get us all the time... 🤓🤤
PinkHatGirl: I work on visualizing the neurological data, nevermind it gets dull
ShoelessJoel: Does it work?
ShoelessJoel: I mean... like... it seems like Bs but hey, it's the new age of civilization
PinkHatGirl: it does but not to the level you want, like we can hook up nodes to your head and place you in front of two buttons, red and blue, if you think hard about the blue button are able to see that and trigger the button click
PinkHatGirl: it’s not at all really but I know why you’d say that
ShoelessJoel: Think... hard... trigger... hmmm.. sex!
PinkHatGirl: the group I work for is sponsored by all the big companies, google, amazon, Apple, facebook
PinkHatGirl: not THERE yet I’m afraid!
ShoelessJoel: Heh...jk
PinkHatGirl: bit who knows, one day maybe
ShoelessJoel: But... I would think those companies would fight for it
PinkHatGirl: it’s a consortium, it’s like an open source thing
ShoelessJoel: Like to get the whole thing... sounds like someone will get a lot of money out of it
ShoelessJoel: Aha... open something...
PinkHatGirl: well, I think so too
ShoelessJoel: So.... do you get bored?
ShoelessJoel: Sounds interesting but tiring
PinkHatGirl: we even had the guy who used to be head of cia under president bush come by to see a demonstration
PinkHatGirl: not at all, I love it!
ShoelessJoel: Cia..... oh man... are you kidding me?!
PinkHatGirl: I even work weekends, hence lonely and surfing dating websites
PinkHatGirl: no I’m not, unfortunately
ShoelessJoel: Good for me!
PinkHatGirl: thank you 😊
ShoelessJoel: It sounds like a cool job...
PinkHatGirl: what do you do for fun?
ShoelessJoel: I talk to pretty ladies like you....
PinkHatGirl: it’s very cool, but way too bureaucratic for me
PinkHatGirl: and stuffy
PinkHatGirl: everyone is wearing khakis and blue button downs
ShoelessJoel: Aha... you need more action...
PinkHatGirl: I’m not that pretty!
ShoelessJoel: You are!
PinkHatGirl: thanks
ShoelessJoel: To me, you're gorgeous..m
PinkHatGirl: I do need more action, I want to dance
PinkHatGirl: do you like dancing?
ShoelessJoel: What are you doing tonight?
PinkHatGirl: I’m at the lab
ShoelessJoel: Let's go!
PinkHatGirl: can’t, waiting on test results to compile
PinkHatGirl: but maybe this weekend I could meet up somewhere
ShoelessJoel: Ehhm....
ShoelessJoel: Sure!
PinkHatGirl: for a drink or something, maybe first
PinkHatGirl: then we can talk about dancing
PinkHatGirl: for all I know you’re into square dancing
ShoelessJoel: Sounds good to me
PinkHatGirl: you did mention tap shoes
ShoelessJoel: I make them...not use them 😜
PinkHatGirl: cool, what’s your real name by the way?
ShoelessJoel: I like more electronic music...
ShoelessJoel: Joel.
PinkHatGirl: oh, EDM?
ShoelessJoel: Yours?
PinkHatGirl: I love that shit
PinkHatGirl: listening right now
ShoelessJoel: More like tramp...m
PinkHatGirl: I’m Zoey
PinkHatGirl: nice to meet you Joel
PinkHatGirl: tramp, I don’t know that
ShoelessJoel: Zoey! Good to meet you too.
PinkHatGirl: yes sir
PinkHatGirl: well I need to get going Joel
ShoelessJoel: You'll like it if you're into electronic sounds
ShoelessJoel: Alright Zoey
PinkHatGirl: if you want to text off this site, my number is 706-204-9224
ShoelessJoel: It was cool talking to you.
PinkHatGirl: ok, I’ll check it out
PinkHatGirl: you too!
ShoelessJoel: Sure thubg
ShoelessJoel: Thing
PinkHatGirl: can wait to hear more about your adventures in the shoe factory
PinkHatGirl: 😜
PinkHatGirl: bye!
ShoelessJoel: 😂😂😭😭😭
ShoelessJoel: Bye!

  It was after 1 am when he lifted his eyes from the screen and glanced at the clock on the wall. Outside the glass windows was the glow of amber pole lights and trash and leaves blowing down the sidewalk. He wiped his eyes and went to the water fountain nearby. He splashed some water on his face and then drank a cold sip. Then he walked to the window and looked out and began once again to contemplate the things he had been reading for the last several hours. It still made no sense to him. He still didn't understand what was so important about this computer or have any clue who was after him for it. He was not a computer guy. Understood almost nothing of what he was reading, but despite that he had managed to piece together the beginning of the story.
  Zoey Jackson had worked at this research facility for some private entity named the Andromeda Group, which according to the Wikipedia page he found was 'a consortium of technology giants working towards the future of human-computer interaction'. Zoey wrote software, manipulating image data read from the brain activity, the best he could understand it. She did not fit in here very well. In fact it doesn't seem she would ever have been hired here without her relationship to Richard Dewey, the Director. Even so, she had done something to piss everyone off, and was fired. The firing had everything to do with Project Aura, but what was that? He had gone through all the folders and files and nothing except for those few emails from Richard Dewey mentioned it. But this was her computer. Maybe the Aura Project was a red herring as to why these people were after the computer, but he didn't think so. Something about the email with those 'men in suits'. He had found plenty of power point and word documents, code files which made no sense to him but seemed related to the day to day work of the lab. Everything seemed very much on the up and up. He didn't know of course but it didn't seem right that this would be what they're after, futuristic as it all was to him, it was related to manipulating buttons and form entry with thoughts, just like she told the man in the chat.
  He paced up and down the corridors of books. He felt safe here for the time being. But he did not feel safe. He knew they would find him again. Maybe it would be for the best to get rid of this damn computer. Hide it somewhere, send them a text of the location, and walk away. He was reasonably sure that was an option. But, if he played his cards rights, if he was smart enough to figure out why this machine was so valuable, he might find leverage to turn this whole nightmare into something good for himself. Pay off Rodriguez for good, get a place, then maybe -- Once these thoughts had grabbed hold of his mind they crowded out anything else that spoke against it. And the other big question was who was after him. If he knew that too it could be leverage. Maybe they had money. Maybe they were the sort that wanted to avoid authorities at all costs. But he knew as much about them as he did about this computer. They were invisible.
  He stopped where he was, on the other side of the library, and ran back to the computer. He had remembered a moment from high school, to a computer class he had taken one semester. He had accidentally erased a report he was writing about the Etowah Indian Mounds field trip, but when he told his teacher in panic she smiles and told him there was probably a backup in the hidden files. Hidden files and folders which were not visible by default on the file system. You had to enter special commands or enable certain options to see them. And when she enabled it for him, he found the backup of his lost report. 
  At the computer he did a search how to see invisible files and folders on an Apple computer, and followed the step by step instructions to turn it on using Finder. And then started at the top-most directory he could find, from the Macintosh HD drive and went through them again, looking for anything he could have missed. After another couple hours of looking he found it.
  Buried inside the directory logs->old->backup he found a hidden folder called p.aura. He opened it and found dozens of files. At the top was a file called _log.txt. He opened that first.
  
Excerpt from _log.txt
  
The neanderthals who discovered fire would not have understood the complex chemical reactions which lead to combustion, but importantly that didn't prevent them from harnessing its power for the benefit of all humanity. - An Analysis of Anthropologic History

Confirmed: I walk through a corn field, somewhere in Ohio? Blue sky. Dried, yellow stalks. I am a child, can't see where I'm going. It's a maze. I'm not supposed to be here. I stumble into a spider web. I panic and fall to the ground and look at the spider in the center of the web. Its enormous. Beautiful patterns on its torso.

Confirmed: My sister and I walk up a large hill next to a road. The hill is covered with trees. We push up a small pink bike, with sparkly tassels, hers. At the top we both get on and ride down together. We go really fast! So much fun!

Confirmed: Sitting on my mother's lap, near a vanity a mirror, reflecting us. The room is yellow. She is reading a letter from my father, he left us. I ask her, 'Is our heart broken?'

Confirmed: At the back of a backyard is a fence. Beyond the fence is a field. A yellow horse grazes there. Named Dusty. She crawls through the fence wires one day, not supposed to go there. Horse chases her. She runs, terrified, to the woods beyond the field. Finds a lake.

Confirmed: At the skating rink, Girls Just Wanna Have Fun, the lights in a star pattern on the ceiling, mother working the concession stand, nacho cheese dip crusty on top, boy with spiked hair, she pinches his butt as he skates by. Eye contact.

Confirmed: A dog, a white house, a man in camo shorts grilling burgers with a beer in hand, a screened-in backporch, a small yard, torn badminton set, trash cans out by a chainlink fence. Rubbing the dogs belly. Sun setting behind the trees.
  
Modified the device harness to be more user friendly. Now the boys in the lab will never find it. I need more test subjects. Was unable to reach Shiela today.

I'm having a hard time thinking about my day to day. It seems pointless now. But I can't work on the project when they are around. Only weekends for now. But I have a codename for it. Aura. I like it. And it suits the experience. My subject, Shiela I'll call her here, is getting a little anxious with my experiments. It doesn't harm her but she says she doesn't like the idea of it. Today I let her try the device on me, since I wanted to experience it from the other side also. She got sick too and that's when she started to complain. After I took her to lunch at the Cracker Barrel and explained that eventually it will be a two-way thing, like a telephone call, and that it doesn't really make sense without that component. She saw through my pie-in-the-sky ruminations though. She said, 'The US military would think it makes sense'. I have been avoiding facing that conclusion, but she's right.
  
Eureka! Over the weekend I found a willing subject to help me test the device. She's an older lady who collects cans along the route I take to get here in the morning. I see her all the time. I stopped and offered her fifty dollars and McDonald's to let me run her through some tests in the lab and she agreed. Tests good so far. Doesn't use too much power. Was able to receive clear visualization and impressions. Subject reported no awareness when device was transmitting. After I became very sick. Need to keep a bucket nearby in the future. For this reason had to cut session short. But it works! But there is some secret sauce that happens once everything is in place that I can't yet explain. Yet. This is all exciting but a little scary too. I don't want to show anyone here in the lab. I don't feel like they'd understand what it needs to be. Maybe its just me.

I built something and need to test it out. Hence this log, to keep track of progress, because I can be a bit of an absent-minded professor, and I don't want to forget something important. So hello future Zoey! I got the idea on a Friday night, after an all-day coding session, writing a script to aggregate image data from the pipeline. We already have one, that Stephen wrote, but its buggy and slow. I fell asleep at my desk listening to Eno. And in my dream I saw this device, something like the node contraption we use on our human lab rats, but it worked in reverse, instead of reading and interpreting it projects and opens a channel to another brainwave. When I woke up I started to think about how to implement something like it. To capture and send a wireless transmission of the aggregated signal is nothing special. Off the shelf wireless transmitting technology can do it, coupled with the systems we already have in place. And custom software of course. But now I need to sleep...zzz

 This had to be it. He read in the log and started to get a picture of things, though still vague. There was a device apparently, but it was not in the bag. He checked the pockets again to make sure. There was a folder called videos filled with recordings of the test sessions, both subject and object, as they were labeled in the filename. He opened one and saw Zoey wearing a pink knit toboggan with little cat ears. She was staring straight ahead and looked something like a zombie, not completely there. A few minutes later she startled and immediately vomited into a bucket on the floor. And then broke into a giddy laugh and raised both arms in a gesture of triumph. He also found an executable file called simply aura and clicked on it. A dialog box popped up with the message,
 
Please connect device

  He packed the computer into its bag and walked outside through the emergency exit in the back. An alarm buzzed loudly inside the building, his heart jumped and he quickened his pace. It was cold and his breath visible in front of him. The tips of his ears stung by the time he reached the parking lot. He got in and let the truck run idle for a few minutes before driving off. Only after he turned onto Broad Street did he switch on the headlights. By now it was 5 am.
  He drove Highway 27 out of the city. There was no other traffic on the road but soon a semi came over the hill and blinded him with its high beams. He turned on his own high beams and flipped the driver off with a snarl.
  "Fuck you too buddy."
  He turned left at the Coca Cola Bottling Plant and passed a sign that read Riverside Industrial Park. Lucky for him several of the pole lights were busted. He switched off his headlights and drove in the dark, able to see dimly by the pale moon over the trees. He passed the Old Fashioned Bakery Distribution center and saw a line of white trucks, drivers sleeping in the seats. Nobody around to see him. Nobody who cared anyway.
  It was obvious he had reached the research facility when he saw the bands of yellow tape across the entranceway and all around the perimeter. He drove past and nearby found a small culdesac almost completely obscured by the woods. He pulled in and parked. He fished out a flashlight and put on the backpack with the computer and set off through the woods towards the facility.
  He brushed aside limbs only to have them lash back into his head and torso. He gazed up and saw the sky had become gray with morning and he knew he didn't have as much time as he would have liked. He figured the earliest any investigators would arrive would be after 9 but wanted to be long gone by then. With luck he would be.
  Soon he emerged from the woods and saw the vast black shape of  the facility looming overhead. Doors on every side were sealed with particle board, nailed around the edges. He would rather been have subtle about this but there was no time for that. He picked up a heavy log near the edge of the woods and heaved it through a un-barricaded window on the rear of the building. It shattered into large shards which fell inward.
  With two hands on the lip of the window he pulled himself up and through, brushing against the jagged edge of the window remains. It pierced his shoulder and he winced but didn't make a sound. He came down hard inside an office. This particular office was not damaged. He went into the hallway and saw things were similar here. No fire damage. No signs of an explosion. He entered the lobby and saw the fragments of glass from the front door glass Grady and Jenn had shattered on the night.
  Several times he stopped mid-walk and stopped breathing. He listened at those moments, wanting to make sure he was still alone in the building. He was keeping a mental map of his path through the darkness, in case he had to make a quick escape. The offices on this level were definitely management, bookkeeping, HR, and not the research teams he was searching for. There were steps leading to the second floor. Here he could see indications of the explosion, random debris, charred drywall, bits of concrete, the walls scorched in places, the paint bubbled, peeling in spots. He went up.
  On the second floor he saw more destruction. This had to be the origin of the explosion. The floor seemed to have been cubicles, decimated now, the walls blackened and scattered here and there. Flat panel monitors poked through the rubble of papers and concrete. He saw the remains of office chairs, whiteboards, picture frames of cute kids. He took a brief look into the next section and saw the lab. It had been a wide open area with stations with computers, destroyed now.
  This was ground zero. This must have been the place where Zoey had run the Aura experiments. If Grady and Jenn had stolen the computer from here, then the device had to be here too, if it were not destroyed. Which it likely was. But he found himself fed by a compulsion he could not really explain, risking being found here, risking being discovered by those dark figures. It seemed worth it to him. He rummaged through the ruins, looking for any sign of Zoey's cubicle. Once he found the proximity of her desk he knew he would find more. 
  One small but important detail he had noticed in the videos he watched. They were not recorded in the lab. They were definitely at her cubicle. He even remembered the number, 21, visible on a plastic card in the background. He looked for anything.
  Outside the sun was shining through the trees, the sky an gray-orange color. Unfortunately he didn't have his phone to see the time, but he knew it was something like 6:30 am. 
  He was rummaging through a pile of rubble when he spotted a picture frame. The picture inside was burned but he could make out what it used to be. It was a photo of Zoey white water rafting with a group of friends. He had found her cubicle. With this he quickened his pace, throwing boards and pieces of char through the air, looking for anything like the device. It seemed hopeless. Nothing he found seemed related to a device or Project Aura, or anything else of note. He found pens, staplers, a calendar of kittens, with no information of course. He found bent and burned remains of a small file cabinet. The door to it was locked but he was able to pry it open.
  The first thing that caught his eye was the pink hat with kitten ears, the same one he had seen Zoey wearing in the videos. So this was her cubicle after all. He went through the rest of the contents, cups of ramen, packets of chai, an empty binder, an instruction manual to a printer. Nothing that resembled a device. And that was it. He kept going through the rubble but found nothing of interest. He did find some cables and grew hopeful but it turned out to be for a monitor.
  By now it was past seven. Maybe even closer to eight. He knew there could be investigators, police showing up anytime. So he stopped, reluctantly, and headed downstairs. When he entered the lobby, however, he noticed something he hadn't seen before. There on the wall was a photograph of everyone, he assumed. They were standing outside the facility, on a sunny day, squinting a a crowd. All wearing the same blue Andromeda Group t-shirt. Everyone wore the t-shirt except for the girl in the back. She had on an army jacket, jeans, and a knitted pink hat with kitten ears. He looked at her face, bored, aloof, even contemptuous. And then something from the log file came back to him, "I hid the device somewhere the boys in the office will never find it." There were several women in this group photo. So her saying "boys" in that way seemed significant all of a sudden.
  Back upstairs the sun was coming into the large window towards the rear of the building. He went directly to the spot where he had found the cabinet and fished out the pink hat. It was dirty but unharmed in the explosion. Being in the cabinet had surely saved it. He folded it inside out and saw a multitude of wires and nodes.
  
  He started the pickup and let it warm up. Then he pulled out of the culdesac and left the industrial park from the other side, out Eden Valley road. It was that time of the morning, commuter traffic. He passed cars and got caught behind a school bus. He grew impatient and zoomed around the other cars, nearly ran over a pack of school kids.
  Once over the mountain he got back on the main road, headed back into town. He couldn't avoid the traffic here so just rode it out. In his mind he made plans to get another place, a hotel he knew up in Adairsville. Nobody would find him there. Then he'd have all the time he needed to examine the device and see if it still worked, and hopefully figure out how much it was worth to those guys.
  As he worked it all out he saw a car coming up on his rear. It was an old Buick, boxy-shaped. He tensed up on the steering wheel and watched them out his rearview mirror. One of the men leaned out the window and pointed a gun. It happened so fast it was like a dream. He swerved into the other lane as the shot went off. But of course the Buick just got behind him again.
  He floored the old 350 engine and his truck pulled ahead. He weaved around several cars, attempting to get out of the line of sight. One car honked at him for the reckless driving and he honked right back at them.
  Not having much time to think he just kept driving, staying on the main road. His hope was maybe a patrol car would be watching from the median. If he saw one he'd stop and get help. But he saw nothing. The Buick was approaching fast, weaving in and out of the other cars on the road like they were utterly still. As they came around a curve where the road split, one going up 411 towards Cartersville, the other into the city proper, he swerved  at the last minute and took 411. A nearby SUV honked furiously as it had to slow down to let him over. The Buick saw too late and slammed on its brakes, but there was too much traffic for it to take the turn. It kept going.
  He took 411 to the bypass to the bypass and turned left, driving past the car dealerships and the minor league baseball stadium. This would lead him into town the back way. He turned near the Board of Education offices, through an old mill village where all the houses were made of red brick. But as he went through a little roundabout he saw the same Buick appear from the other side. It swerved in front of another car, which had to stop completely, and came up on him going at least fifty.
  "Jesus!"
  He hammered on the gas and a block later went over a speed bump at a crosswalk too fast. The bounce jolted him out of his seat and his head hit the roof of the car, his vision flashed. the backpack with the computer and device landed on the floorboard. But he kept going. He looked behind and saw the Buick slow down to avoid the bump. But immediately speed up.
  Nearby there was a small park with a baseball field. He used to hang out at this park with his friends when he was a teenager so he knew there was a way out of the subdivision behind that park and figured he could make it in his pickup through the park and up the small hill whereas that old Buick might not. So without much hesitation he swerved to the right and went down the grass slope into the park, tearing up clods of mud and blowing leaves into the air. He went through the swing sets and the seats and chain banged against the windshield but did not crack it. In the rearview he didn't see the Buick at all and kept going until he reached the small hill where the small road joined. The pickup swerved up the hill and he nearly lost traction in the mud, but he had enough acceleration and came down over the curb onto the road. Nobody followed him. The road in front of him and behind him was empty. Quiet. He drove the speed limit, hearing bits of mud rattle in the wheel well as they spun from the tires. He let out a breath and tried to think things through.
  The plan now was to get somewhere safe and take a closer look at this device, make sure its still working properly. Then if it was working, he'd buy a burner from Walmart and text Grady's number to see if they wanted to make a deal. And they'd sure as shit have to pay.
  He wondered how exactly they were able to track him down this time and the only thing he could figure was they had marked his pickup somehow. He guessed it wouldn't be that hard, assuming you had the manpower to post lookouts on the roads into and out of the city. This rusted piece of shit was distinct enough. The thought made him nervous. He had to ditch it.
  Turning onto North Broad he went down a dilapidated section of town. In the parking lot of a Baptist church with large slate panels he parked, near the back, behind the air conditioner units and not visible from the road. He grabbed the backpack from the floorboard and stuffed the flashlight in his pocket, as well as a pair of work gloves, and then hoofed it up a hill to the neighborhood which ran parallel to the main road.
  Low gray clouds moved overhead, a chilly wind blew through the limbs of the oak trees which grew between the homes here. He put on the backpack and buttoned his jacked, stuffing his hands in the pockets and made his way through the neighborhood's back roads in the general direction of downtown. There was another hotel he knew of, cheap weekly rates. He could hole up there for awhile. He had cash enough for that. Then there was the problem of a vehicle, but he would think about that later.
  His ears and nose and lips started to freeze. His eyes watered. He could even feel the cold seeping through his jeans. He removed his hands from his pockets and rubbed the extremities but the warmth was only temporary. He was also hungry. Tired. Despite this he picked up the pace. He had never been on these roads or even in this neighborhood but knew it had to join up with Turner McCall at some point. He could walk behind the businesses and hotels until he was in a safer area.
  Half an hour later he was surrounded by the smells of fast food joints, piping the smells out of vents to lure customers. Smells of burgers, fried chicken, barbecue. His stomach twisted and he felt a burning sensation. He spotted a local coffee shop and decided to duck in. They were well known for good coffee and damn good country ham biscuits. He walked up, turned to make sure nobody was looking at him, no boxy Buicks, and went inside.
  This time of day was the time when all the college students came here before class, studying, talking. Hung on the walls were bad pencil drawings of celebrities, bright, colorful folk art in shapes like fish, cows, farm equipment. In the back was a vintage coffee bean roaster. The music they played inside was classic Americana, Elvis, Buddy Holly, Roy Orbison. He wandered to the counter, looking for a good, hidden place to sit. The place was full of patrons.
  "What can I get for you today, sir?"
  He turned to face the woman at the register, her bright purple hair done up in a bun, smiling at him.
  "Coffee with milk."
  But then he noticed her smile turn into wide-eyed horror. She screamed and ducked. He had just enough time to turn and see two figures, dressed in dark coats, standing in the doorway, guns drawn and pointed in his direction. He ran for the other side of the shop, to the other entrance, ducking behind a table. By now everyone in the place had seen the two men with guns and started screaming, some running for the exit, some hiding under the tables. Shots rang out. Wood splintered on the table near him. He heard shouting and took the chance to run for the door. 
  He was outside. The backpack slowed him down somewhat, its weight moving against his stride, but he pumped his feet as fast as possible and turned the corner and ran up some stone steps to a row of lawyer's offices. Behind him he heard shots and screams, running on the sidewalk. He didn't look back. Beyond the row of offices was a chainlink fence. He hopped that and found himself in a leaf-strewn alley behind several buildings. Between them he found three or four large city-provided garbage cans with yellow lids. He lifted one of the lids and smelled the sour, rotten garbage inside. He quickly reached in and tossed the bags into both the other bins until it was empty, and then got inside. The backpack snagged on the lip so he quickly removed it and held it between his legs. He closed the lid. He waited, breathing in the smell, wanting to throw up from the smell, hoping they would not find him.
  From inside the can he could hear nothing, only traffic sounds distant, a squirrel running through the leaves. There were no more shouts or gunfire. No heavy footsteps in this direction. The air inside was suffocating, several times he retched uncontrollably but still waited. It might have been half an hour later when he emerged, lifting the lid slowly, breathing in the clean air. He got out.
  He walked to a place where he could see the parking lot next to the coffee shop. Several police cars were there, blue lights flashing, an ambulance. People standing around, looking concerned. Cars pulling in and out, taking photos. He turned and walked the other way, keeping behind the buildings, hoping nobody would spot him that could recognize him from the coffee shop. He walked until he came to the river, the same path he had taken the previous day from the library. He walked the path beside the river until he was near downtown. There was a small open area where the city's pontoon boat was moored. He sat down on the bench here and waited longer, collecting his thoughts. Once again the smell of food filled his nostrils and his stomach lurched. There was a Waffle House up on the hill. He talked himself into attempting it, his reason being the all-glass front of the Waffle House would make it difficult for his pursuers to sneak up on him, and that he knew the layout of the back kitchen of these places, had a buddy that used to work there, and knew he could easily escape out the back if it came down to it. Even if that was all bullshit he was telling to convince himself, he needed food.
  Towards the back he found an empty booth and sat facing the door. A waitress came by a couple minutes later and set down a coffee with milk. He said thank you and then asked her for something to eat.
  "Pecan waffle and a side of bacon."
  "You got it, hon."
  He drank the coffee and when the food came he scarfed it down quickly, and ordered seconds. Then scarfed those down. He felt much better after eating, felt his mind getting clearer. For the first time in awhile he started to relax. Maybe the event at the coffee shop had scared those guys off. With the police getting involved. He thought about getting out there again, walking to the extended stay, but it felt good to sit here, in the warmth, with a full belly.
  Instead he unzipped the backpack and pulled out the computer. He set it on the table in front of him and turned it on. Then he pulled out the knitted pink hat, the device, and found the black USB cable which came out the back of it, and plugged it in. It occurred to him then this was something like a moment of truth and he tensed up. He found the directory p.aura just like before and started up the program. It took a few seconds but then a dialog with a progress bar appeared and a few seconds after that it was complete and the application window appeared. At the bottom of the window was a small indicator with a message in green letters,

Device is Ready

  The inside of the pink knitted hat was covered with black wires and nodes which were made of a sponge-like padding. To him the device looked dangerous yet even so he hesitated only a moment before placing the hat on his head and pulling the sides down around his ears. Then he saw and heard and even felt things that no human being was ever meant to experience.
	  To him it was like being transported to the bottom of the ocean. He was on the floor of some undisturbed plain submerged in a viscous fluid. Yet he was also still in the booth in the Waffle House, he was still sitting down, or maybe he wasn't in the Waffle House at all. It was hard to tell. At first he could see nothing. Everything was dark, even sound had gone silent. But very slowly, extremely slowly it was not dark anymore. But was not light either. And the sounds returned but very far away, really as if he were at the bottom of the ocean and listening to conversations miles above. He could not recognize his surroundings. Perhaps he was somewhere else. It could be the ocean of another planet, one of the planets of Jupiter maybe. That was as reasonable as anything else. As his vision became accustomed to the fluid he saw shapes coming into and going out of focus. The shapes themselves wavered, as if they were also made of this same viscous fluid. It was all the same somehow. He looked down at his arms and saw two dark and unfamiliar shapes that could have been his arms, might have been, but he didn't recognize them as his own limbs. They did not seem to belong to him at all and moved of their own accord, imperceptibly slow.
  He was not afraid. Nothing about it made him afraid. In fact there was a part of him, somewhere in his brain, that might have even recognized this place. It felt familiar though completely alien to his forty years on Earth. Time passed. Or maybe it didn't. That too seemed connected to the viscosity of everything else. The only indication he had that things were changing was that his eyes were becoming more and more accustomed to this way of seeing. It was getting brighter but with no discernible source of light. The dark amoeba-like shapes around him began to take on more solid form. The sounds which had been miles away were closer now. Not very close and still the effect was like listening to something underwater, but they grew louder and louder. So time was passing though very slowly. As the shapes came into focus he began to imagine what sort of creatures they might become when they did fully form. Imagine if he had been taken to some strange planet. But even fearful thoughts like this were automatic and he did not take them seriously.
  Hours passed. He never became tired or irritable. Never needed to use the bathroom. He was completely at ease just to observe his surroundings. By now he knew where he was. Still in the booth at the Waffle House. He had been all along. The dark shapes he saw floating in the fluid were patrons, the waitress approaching him with a pot of coffee, the line cook flipping a patty melt. By now the light was nearly back to normal, though dimmed, much like the light during a solar eclipse. The sounds too were back to normal with just a bit of reverberation. But the strange thing was that time had not yet caught up to the light and the sound.
  The waitress he had recognized, his waitress, bringing the pot of coffee, had been walking towards him now for hours. The line cook had been flipping the same patty melt for the same duration. Time itself was viscous but just like his eyes and ears had become accustomed to the change so too was his experience of time catching up though it was taking much longer. An overweight woman sitting with two other women two booths in front of him had been sinking her teeth into the same cheeseburger the whole time. It was fascinating to watch. Time was passing so if he watched a particular place for awhile he could see minute changes. The look in the woman's eyes kept grabbing his attention. He thought she was about to break into a laugh the way her eyes were squinting, cheeks rising. His waitress, whose name was Ann as he could read on her name tag, had tired, forlorn eyes. Her mind was elsewhere. This was the face he kept returning to. Everyone else he observed seemed in this moment, except for Ann.
  Funny things started to happen once time had caught up to his normal experience. The dimness never went away and the sounds still came from underwater, but just as time seemed to catch back up, he started noticing the people in the Waffle House. They looked different. He hadn't noticed exactly when it happened. At first he thought maybe the light was changing yet again. But no. The best way he could make sense of it was that the people, and just the people, were more transparent than they had been before. Transparent wasn't the right word. He couldn't see through their bodies in any way. He thought maybe the word he was looking for was dimension. They were more dimensional than before. He could see further into them. Further than three dimensions anyway. But only when he focused and _really_ looked at them.
  What did he see when he looked at Ann? He saw that her mind was on her husband, who had recently been diagnosed with early-stage dementia. He also had a history of gambling and used to make trips to Pearl River Casino and lie about it, telling his wife they were business trips. So he had went through all their savings, took out second and third mortgages, and accrued hundreds of thousands dollars of debt, just when they were both about to retire. So she had to get work. She worked for the state for thirty years but they wouldn't hire her now due to cutbacks. So she took this job waitressing, just to make enough money to pay their mortgages and now the doctors say he'll only get worse and worse and she'll end up taking care of him one day as if he were just a baby and then he'll die and she'll be alone for the rest of her life.
  "Let me fill that up for you, hon."
  She filled his coffee. He looked at her, rubbing his eyes. She caught his eyes and grinned.
  "I sure do like that hat."
  His eyes went to the woman who was biting into her cheeseburger. She was laughing now, the woman sitting next to her was pointing at him, at the pink hat he wore, and they both sniggered and tried to hide the fact when they saw him staring.
  At the bar he saw a character. A young man, fat and balding but whose curly hair went around his crown like a doughnut. Something repulsive about him. He was shoveling in a western omelette with sausage links and coffee. He sat alone, slouched over his plate, frowning. As he looked closer he could tell the man was counting money. Six hundred from yesterday plus the thousand from this weekend, added with what they had already saved made just about ten thousand. He found if he looked closer he could learn more about the man, from the thoughts he could go deeper and explore the memories those thoughts were connected to. Jody, his name. And then saw a young Latina woman, pregnant. She had a bruised face, bruised back where he had beaten her many times. But why? Because he forced her to have sex with strange men in a nearby motel. He had brought her to the United States, promising a future life, a husband, children. Lies he told her. But he was making a lot of money. Planning to move to Florida. Buy a fishing boat, start a business. He was very close to having enough for the down payments but was concerned, afraid even, of getting caught. He wouldn't be able to handle prison. He had started to take Xanax to deal with the stress of dealing with her. Bitch that she was. Ungrateful for the life he was planning for them both. Why was she putting him through this stress? He looked closer and saw the room numbers, 104 and 110. 104 is where they met with the johns. 110 was where they stayed and where the money was, hidden in a gash in the bottom of the mattress.
    At that moment the young man pulled a cell phone from his jacket pocket and looked at a text message. Then he stood and went to the register, paid for his food, and burped as he stood there waiting to sign the receipt. Then he walked out the exit.
    He pulled the device from his head and immediately felt vertigo, like he were falling off a tall building. He caught himself on the table and booth and yelled in a panic. Everyone turned around. But their looks went unnoticed because he next felt an intense wave of nausea come over him. He nearly vomited on the table but managed to hold it in and ran into the bathrooms and collapsed over a toilet just in time. His entire breakfast came up. When he stood he felt dizzy and heavy-headed. He went back to his booth and saw the young man outside, waiting for the light to cross the street. He quickly stuffed the computer and device into the backpack and stumbled through the exit to follow him.
His skin pale, clammy, his stomach weak, several times he had to stop and place both hands on his knees and nearly vomited on the sidewalk, drooling from his mouth onto his boots. His vision was still blurry so he was glad to at least know where Jody was headed. He even knew what room number. Still, he wanted to keep close if only to verify that the things he had seen were true. He waited for the light to change for pedestrian traffic and then crossed to the other side. Jody was straight ahead, nobody else on the sidewalk but he was far enough away that he would never suspect anything even if he did turn around. They arrived at the Super 8 and he held back, walking the perimeter to find a spot where he could stake out the rooms without being seen.
  He found a wooden fence separating this parking lot from the one just over, another hotel and a spot where one of the boards had come loose. He ducked between it and crouched. From here he could see room 110 and part of 104. At the moment the door to 110 was partway open. In a few minutes Jody emerged and stood outside the door, one leg propped up on the wall. He pulled a vape pen from his pocket and held it up to his mouth, concealed. Massive clouds of vapor billowed into the parking lot. A few minutes after that he saw a young Latina woman wearing tight jean shorts and a white tank top walk from room 104. When Jody saw her he straightened up and stood by looking around as she walked inside 110. He followed her inside and slammed the door.
  He had seen a few things. One thing he had seen was that Jody, being paranoid, had left an extra room key stuffed inside the gap in the door trim, at the top. This was in case he was out and the woman needed to get out of 104 for any reason. That was the protocol. Only business in 104. No lingering there. The other thing was that tonight was the night when he hung out with some of his other friends, down at the pool hall, for beers and to watch the game.
  Around 3pm a Ford Mustang pulled up and honked twice. A minute later Jody emerged, wearing a bright yellow jersey, but instead of numbers it had a frightening clown face. His face also was painted black and yellow, also like a clown. He got into the car and it whipped around in reverse and peeled out of the parking lot.
  He waited a little while longer and approached room 110. In his hand he carried a brick he found near the fence, just in case he needed to defend himself. Above the door he found the extra key card and put it into the slot. The light turned green and he flung the door open, remaining outside in case the woman had a weapon. Nothing. He went into the room and shut the door. Nobody was there, but the door to the bathroom was closed. The room was a disaster. Clothes were scattered everywhere, hanging on the dresser, on the mirror, black lace bras and panties, a faux leather skirt, shorts, shoes in the corner. A carton of condoms and tissue boxes on the nightstand. Empty two liter bottles of Faygo soda in an overflowing trash can, pizza boxes stuffed behind it. 
  From the things he had seen before he knew exactly where to look for the money. With both hands he flipped the large mattress on its side on the floor beside the bed. The gash was there. He reached in a pulled out several dollar rolls. There were ten total so he figured a thousand in each. He stuffed them into the backpack slung it across his shoulder. But as he began to walk out again he looked back at the bathroom door and saw that it was now cracked open, a single eye peering out.
  He approached the door.
  "I'm not going to hurt you."
  The door shut as he came closer and he heard noises inside. When he reached the door he placed his hand on the knob and twisted. It was not locked.
  Inside on the tile floor, he saw the Latina woman, unclothed, her arms twisted up behind her back, handcuffed to an exposed pipe under the sink. She was not facing him, her back was bruised purple and green, but when she heard the door open she twisted her neck around and when she saw it was a stranger she started screaming. Then a small child, a girl, ran up to her and put her arm around the woman's neck and eyed him as if she were her protector, warning him to be careful.
  He backed away. The girl also had bruises on her arms and cheek. Her hair was unwashed. Clothes covered in old food stains.
  "My mom is hurt."
  He said nothing.
  "She needs a doctor. Are you a doctor?"
  "No."
  "Then you can't help her."
  She let go of her mother and reached out and shut the door on him. He stood for a few moments and then went to the door to the parking lot. He took one more glance around the room and walked outside.
  Jody stood there. He was much taller and stared down at him, his eyes narrowed, his expression hard, still in the clown makeup. He felt something on his chest, the point of a knife.
  "Get inside."
  The blade dug into his chest.
  He inched backwards into the room. Jody followed and shut the door behind them. The knife continued to press him back until his legs hit the edge of the bed and he sat down on it. Jody stood over him, looking at him. Then Jody went to the mattress and stuck his hand into the gash. He pulled out nothing and suddenly flew at him.
  "Where the fuck is my money you goddamn thief? You piece of human shit! You fuck!"
  Jody kicked him hard in the shins. And then stomped around the room, fuming, his chest expanding, arms flexing as if he were ready to explode.
  "In my backpack."
  Jody snatched the backpack off his shoulders and rummaged through it. He dumped the computer, the device, everything onto the box spring. The rolls of money came out too, bounced. He picked up the rolls one by one and counted them.
  Jody had stopped fuming and now just stared at him.
  At that point the door to the bathroom opened and the girl ran out. Everyone turned to her.
  "Daddy, momma's hurt. She told me she needs a doctor."
  Jody frowned at her.
  "Go back to the bathroom, sweetie. Daddy's working."
  The girl returned to the bathroom, looking from her father to the man on the bed to the mattress on its side. She closed the door once inside again.
  "Let me tell you why you're gonna give me that ten thousand."
  Jody leaned in close to him and looked curious.
  "Why?"
  The man looked at him.
  "Because you don't want anybody to know about your business in this room and room 104. That would be very bad for you."
  Jody stood up again, eyes widening.
  "Because I need money. I got debts. So the deal is you give me that money, and I walk away forever. And nobody finds out about your business here."
  Jody nodded and pulled out his knife.
  "There's another option, can you guess what that would be?"
  "You could kill me and dump the body in the river, or somewhere hidden."
  "That would be a hell of a lot better deal for me."
  The man stared.
  "Sure would be. But you won't do that."
  "Why not?"
  "Because you're a coward."
  Jody rushed in again and got right in his face. He held the knife to his neck, the blade on his jugular.
  "You frontin, motherfucker? You ain't go no idea what I'm about! Ask my boy Trey, ask Nick Wallace. You think you hard?"
  He stared Jody in the eye and saw all the same things he had seen in him earlier, in the Waffle House. Then he closed his eyes and imagined that he would die at this moment and discovered that he truly did not care. He let go of all the waste his life had become, of the things he had held out hope for, to get back again. And it was freeing. A sense of freedom was in that. So he embraced it. And it really was a shock to him when Jody folded and handed him the ten thousand and gave him back his bag and the computer and device. And he was in a sort of unreal state of not being fully present when he back out of the door into the parking lot and walked onto the sidewalk beside the traffic. He only felt himself again after walking a few blocks and started to think about the money in the backpack and that he should pay off Rodriguez in Kennesaw as soon as he could but that he needed a car to do that.

  Along the sidewalk beside Shorter Avenue he went, unsure where he was going or what he was looking for exactly. Yet something like a plan was slowly growing in his mind. He had ten thousand, which was about half of what he owed to Rodriguez. This would buy him time no doubt but he would still be in debt. Yet when it had occurred to him that he needed a car to get to Kennesaw where Rodriguez did business, it also occurred to him that if he were to hijack a car worth some money, drive it there, and hand the keys along with the cash to Rodriguez, that might be enough to clear his debts. There were some details to work out, but the important thing was he knew Rodriguez and his crew were known to deal with lifted vehicles, from time to time. And if not, at least he would know where it could be unloaded without drawing suspicion and before the police in that area were looking for a vehicle with that description. The only thing was he had to get out of the city without drawing attention. Assuming he took the backroads into Kingston, he could reach Cartersville, then 75 without even seeing any cops. That it was close to five worked in his benefit, since there would be a lot of traffic on the roads for distraction.
  He crossed the road, stopping in the turning lane to wait for a break in the line of cars. When he reached the other side he went into a Tom Thumb and got a coffee, hot dog, and a pac of Marlboro Lights. He hadn't smoked in hours and was feeling the jitters all of a sudden. As he stood around back of the gas station he saw a gravel parking lot full of cars. Most of them old pickups, old sedans, but there was one that stood out. It looked like a brand new Toyota Tacoma pickup, 4x4, red metallic paint. That truck is worth at least thirty thousand, he thought, and imagined the respect he'd get from Rodriguez if he handed over the keys to that bad boy, along with the ten thousand in cash. After he finished his coffee and hot dog, he smoked while he scoped out the area.
  The parking lot adjoined a garage for big trucks, a big blue building with a huge sliding door for an entrance. From here he could see all of them inside, one leaning over the engine bay of some school bus, one wrenching underneath a cabover, the others on break outside, smoking, bullshitting. One guy remained in the office but came out eventually and hollered for one of the mechanics.
  He stubbed out his cigarette and walked over to a hidden spot underneath a tree with some bushes. He knelt low and hooked up the device to the computer. It occurred to him that he might be able to leave the computer on in the bag, with the USB cable connected to the device. This would allow him to wear the device while the software was running on the computer in the backpack on his back. He changed the setting that turned the computer off when the clamshell was closed. He then started up the program and put on the device.
  Once again he was transported to the bottom of the ocean but it seemed less intense this time - the visual, auditory, and time drag, all took less time to return to normal. It felt to him like his body was becoming accustomed to the weird transition. So again he found himself looking out at a dim world where things were nearly the same but not quite. He looked at the mechanics in the shop and saw they also had that same kind of extra dimensionality as those people in the Waffle House.
  One by one he looked closer at them, this time concentrating on the thing he wanted to know. Which car was theirs, where were the keys, and were there any hidden in the cars themselves, to make his plan easier to pull off. And he found that he could see that information. _Seeing_ was the wrong word but there is no word for the exact experience, though _knowing_ might be closer. 
  The mechanics drove the cars and trucks he was not interested in. But the manager, the pencil pusher who stayed in the wood-paneled office most of the time, when he came out and he focused on him, he saw the whole thing. First laying eyes on it at dealership on a Sunday evening, going for a test drive that next day, talking to the credit union about a loan, getting fucked over on the trade-in for the his old Mitsubishi Montero Sport, but doing it anyway because he was so excited, signing the paperwork and driving off with it that same day. He saw him wash and wax it and wipe it dry with a microfiber cloth. And then he saw him buy a magnetic key holder and put the spare inside it, and then place the holder under the passenger wheel well, on the frame, hidden from all thieves.
  He removed the device and once again felt the nausea, enough to make him vomit up the hot dog and coffee from earlier, but again not quite as intense as before. And he guessed the more he used it the less nauseous he would be after, until he was no longer nauseous at all. Recovered, he placed the device in the backpack and waited until everyone in the garage seemed occupied. When they were he crept across the road and knelt inside a drainage ditch. Then on hands and knees he crawled to the passenger side of the Tacoma and slid as much under the truck as he could get. Then he fished in the wheel well for the key holder and after a few blind grabs he found it and pulled it  loose. He removed the key and tossed the holder on the ground, then slid out the other side and stood up.
  Two hands grabbed him around the shoulder and slammed him into the ground.
  "What the fuck do you think you're doing, buddy?"
  A kick hit him in the ribs and he doubled over, groaning involuntarily.
  "That's my truck asshole! You messed with the wrong guy this time."
  Another kick. Then there were voices.
  "What's going on, James?"
  "Caught this sonofabitch trying to steal my truck."
  "Let's call the cops on his ass!"
  "Hey man, you got like since two seconds ago to get the fuck outta here or we're calling the cops!"
  One more kick into his side, as he stood up. He fell against the door of the Tacoma.
  "Off the truck!"
  The man named James grabbed his hand and twisted it hard until he felt his wrist was about to break, and he collapsed to the ground again, but quickly got to his feet and stumbled off, into the ditch. He felt a fist come down hard on his left cheek and saw a flash of light and then black as his head hit the grass. Another kick and then the voices were further away.
  "We'll be keeping an eye on you. Don't be showing your ass around here no more!"
  They were gone. He limped to the place behind the Tom Thumb, where he had eaten his food and drank his coffee and smoked. He collapsed agains the brick wall and sat there for some time, wincing from the pain. He was sure he had a broken rib. After awhile he went inside and went to the bathroom and washed his face. Already his wrist was beginning to swell and it hurt when he twisted his back. He went outside, the store clerk eyeing him suspiciously as he winced out the door.
  He kept walking the sidewalk. Inside he was furious. At himself. At those mechanics. Especially the one. James. He imagined stabbing him in the eye with a fork and pulling out the fork with the eyeball impaled on it and then shoving it down his fucking throat until he choked on it. He wanted to fucking kill him and then keep on killing him until there was nothing left of him to kill. 
  He found himself in another parking lot, walking on gravel. He was walking through a storage facility. He saw a sign, U-Stor-It. Rows and rows of of white buildings with sliding doors, padlocked. He walked through them, not seeing anything really, still enraged. But then his eyes caught something in the corner of the place, near the chainlink fence at the edge of the property. An old Chevrolet Citation, green, covered with leaves and pollen dust, a tire partially flat. He changed direction and walked up to it. The door was open. Inside it was musty. He got in. Under the floor mat he found a key. He turned the ignition and the engine turned over but didn't start. He tried again and the same. He tried a third time and it started.
  When the engine had warmed for several minutes he put it into gear and drove it slowly off the lot, out the exit gate. He returned to the Tom Thumb and put some air in the flat tire. Now the thing to do was to get to Kennesaw, pay off Rodriguez the ten thousand, buy himself some time. So he started the car and pulled around and parked around the back side of the gas station, where he could observe the garage and the mechanics. He switched off the car and sat there for some time, watching them. 
  Ever so often they'd scan the parking lot, looking for him no doubt, then return to the job at hand. He hooked up the device and placed it on his head. After becoming acclimated he spied on them again. Inside he was seething. Most of all he wanted to see the manager James. Soon he came out of the office and sipped from the water fountain. He used this moment to focus in on him, traveling inward, inward as much as he could, directing his rage inward. And then as he was walking back into the office he slipped on a spot on the concrete floor and fell hard onto his back and his head banged the concrete floor hard. The others saw the accident and ran over to him. He sat up, looking confused, disoriented, and felt around the back of his head. On his fingers was blood.
  One of the mechanics grabbed a rag and brought it over and held it over his wound. Eventually one of them stuck out his forearm and James held on and pulled himself up. He was a bit shaken, laughing it off. The other guys laughed too but they secretly looked one to another with concern. He watched James enter the office and sit behind the desk. He sat there for some time, not doing anything, staring at the paperwork. A couple times he rose from the seat but sat down again, confused.
  He could not explain the mechanism by which the event occurred but he felt as if he could do it again if he wanted, and without  too much difficulty. It was a matter of projecting your own thoughts into the subject. He hadn't commanded James to slip and fall on the floor. It didn't seem to work specifically like that. It was like he had been projecting the thought of _harm_ towards him and something within James had received that thought and then acted upon it, and from what he could tell, it was on a completely subconscious level.
  From here he could see into the office by a little window. He could see his forehead and a little of his shoulders but that was all. He decided to try it again. All he had to do was think of the beating James had given him and all the rage and anger rose up again in his imagination, and he once again projected those feelings towards his adversary. A moment later James picked up a stapler and a moment after that he heard the muffled shouting from inside the office. He saw him dancing around inside, the staple gun hanging from his thumb. A couple of the mechanics went inside and looked shocked. It appeared that he had not just stapled his thumb but had stapled through his thumbnail into the quick. James held out his arm and one of the guys gave a tug upwards and it came out. There was some blood but not a lot. He wrapped it with the same rag he had used only minutes ago on the wound from his fall.
  It was getting to be quitting time. He saw the others wrapping up their work, sweeping the floor. One of them got into the bus they were working on and started it. He pulled out of the garage and seemed to be finding a spot to park it for the night, outside. He focused in on the driver and kept focusing while he did a three point turn in the parking lot. But then when the bus was in reverse it suddenly accelerated at full speed backwards. The driver looked as if he had forgotten how to drive. As the bus gained speed the driver laid on the horn just as the rear of the bus smashed into the front of the red Tacoma, still parked in the same spot as before. The bumper and hood of the pickup crumpled and inside the cab the driver side airbag deployed. The force of the impact pushed the truck into the ditch. For a few seconds the wheels of the bus kept spinning until finally it seemed the driver regained control and put the bus in park. The side door to the bus flew open and the man jumped out and looked with horror at what he had done. Soon after that James saw the wreckage and took off in a sprint over to it. He was shouting and raising his fist in the air.
  The driver of the bus raised his hands and looked as if he were apologizing. James did not even hesitate. He shoved the guy to the dirt and began pummeling his face. The others came over and pulled him off. He relented and came up face red and chest heaving. The driver lay there holding his nose. James was shouting in frustration and went to the oak tree nearby and kicked it with all his strength, which seemed to only injure himself as he limped back to the others.
  He started to imagine the possibilities this device had and more importantly he started to understand why it was so deadly important to his pursuers. In the wrong hands this device could do some real damage. He watched them pull the bus around to the side of the building. He saw James walk over and apologize to the mechanic who drove the bus though he still looked very upset. They eventually shook hands. James got into the pickup and started it up. It still ran. He put it in gear and turned the wheels. It was drivable. They pulled the sliding metal door closed and locked it up. By then the sun was going down, the evening cold and the light darkening. Cars on the road next to the shop already had their headlights on. 
  He removed the device and put it into the backpack. When he saw the wrecked Toyota pull into the side street to enter traffic he backed out of the Tom Thumb parking lot and turned in the same direction, several cars behind. If you had asked him why he was following the driver of the Tacoma he would not have been able to say why. The smarter thing would have been to drive on to Kennesaw and pay down his debts to Rodriguez. But the anger he felt had not been erased by his acts of revenge. In fact they only seemed stronger. Whenever he imagined James kicking him in the ribs he felt a welling of frustration and violence inside. He breathing was so rapid and shallow it looked as if he had run a marathon.
  "Motherfucker."
  He clenched the steering wheel of the Citation and growled violently. He beat the passenger seat with his right fist.
"You goddamn sonofabitch. I'll murder you. I'll eat your liver. I'll eat your brains and kidneys and rip out your fucking spinal cord and shove it up your ass!"
  James took the bypass home and he followed close behind. By now it was dark and there was no way for him to be spotted so he was not concerned about that. James turned onto Eden Valley road and disappeared around the first curve of that road. He followed him there and when he made the curve he saw the red tail lights just ahead. No lights on this road. They were in the country now. No other cars. Now was the time.
  He floored the accelerator and heard the engine rev and saw those tail lights getting closer by the second. And then a hard crunch as the Citation rammed into the rear of the Tacoma. The truck swerved into the next lane and accelerated at the same time. He nearly lost control of it, even going off the road into the brush for a moment but then brought it back. He took the opportunity of confusion to ram the truck again, this time clipping the side. He laid on his horn at the same time. He saw James in the cabin turning around, headlights on his face. He looked terrified as he just floored it. By now he was probably going seventy, on these back roads that was a death sentence.
  But then he laid off the gas. He switched off his own headlights and drove in the dark, far behind him.
  The Tacoma continued to drive fast and nearly lost it around some curves up the road. He had another idea what to do and was a least a quarter mile behind at this point, following the small tail lights in the dark, using them to tell him where to go. He made a right turn here and a left turn there and came to Price road. When he turned onto Price he kept back even further. He saw the Tacoma pull into a driveway and found a spot off the road to park, hidden from the road, behind the bushes and trees.
  He got out of the Citation and walked the road to where he had seen the Tacoma pull in. It was a nice house, painted white with gray shutters, simple but modern, with a front porch and a garage, and a large yard in front, with kids toys strewn about. A nice home to raise a family. He stayed in the darkness of the bushes as he approached the house on the other side of the road. James it seemed was still in the Tacoma. Soon he got out and walked around the vehicle, from time to time looking up the road. He was on his cell phone. Eventually he saw a patrol car pull in from the other direction. An officer got out and shook his hand. He seemed to be telling him the story of the truck but more importantly how some crazy driver had crashed into him on the way home. He showed him the damage to the rear of the truck. The officer took down notes on a pad.
  At that point the porch light came on and a woman in a night gown and coat came down the steps. James turned to her and they embraced. When she saw the damage to the Tacoma a hand went to her mouth and her eyes widened. She rubbed his back in consolation. He watched and all those feelings of rage melted into jealousy. What a kind and beautiful woman. She had always been kind to him. His fucking up their relationship was something he'd never forgive himself for. Now she had moved on and found a provider, stable, in good health. But the pangs in his heart did not leave him. Still as beautiful as ever she was. It had been over a year since he'd last seen her, at the court hearing. Maturity was making her even more beautiful, untouchable in some way. She gave off a glow that to him felt decent and radiant and heartwarm.
  "Suzanne," he whispered from the shadows of the woods across the street. Speaking her name brought her closer to him, somehow. Made their time together more real. She held onto his arm like she used to hold onto his. It hurt to see that. The police officer got back in the patrol car and backed out. He ducked in the bushes so as not to be seen. When its tail lights had disappeared around the curve in the road he stood up again.
  James and Suzanne were on the porch, gazing with forlorn expressions at the pickup, holding onto one another for support. They went inside and turned off the porch light. He came out of the bushes and walked across the street, closer to their house, where he could see into the large bay window. Through the living room he could see the kitchen, Suzanne in the kitchen, finishing dinner for them. James was not around, probably washing up, changing into more comfortable clothes. He went closer, now in their yard, hiding under the canopy of a Southern Magnolia. The smell of the food seeped through the cracks in the ventilation, through the windows and doors. He smelled her meatloaf, mashed potatoes, and green beans cooked in ham. James entered the kitchen just as she was pulling a hot rolls from the oven. She set the aluminum pan on the kitchen table and broke them apart. Her husband came up behind her and wrapped his arms around her waist. He saw her eyes shut and a warm smile appear on her face. She turned with the pot holders still over her hands and kissed him.
  Tears fell onto his cheeks. They nearly froze in the cold January air. He looked above him and heard the large, waxen leaves rustling in the wind. Beyond them he saw the sky, black out here in the country, the stars shining bright. The tears he wiped away. They had surprised him because he had not even realized he was crying. But it made sense. So many things made sense to him now. He missed her. God how he missed her. 
  And then his boy Joseph, now taller and dark in the hair than he remembered, sauntered into the dining room, giggling. He ran up to James and hugged his legs. James ruffled his hair and leaned down and kissed the top of the boy's head. Then the family sat down to dinner.
  He watched them eat and talk to one another. He guessed the main topic tonight was the truck and how one of the guys at the shop hit it with a school bus and then how a crazy person out of nowhere rammed his car down on Morrison Campground. His eyes were fixed on his boy. His heart dropped out of him as he realized how much time had really passed since he had seen him. How important all those days and weeks and months are to a child. He was growing. He had grown so much. The ache he felt inside was like a bottomless pit sucking the rest of him into it. He wanted so much to provide for his son. To be able to provide for him. To give to him. To give him the world if he asked. To give and give again and never stop giving.

  Before he realized where he was he gripped the steering wheel with both hands as if to avoid an immanent traffic accident. But the car was parked. The roaring sound that had woken him was only a nearby Mexican worker with a leaf blower, creating a wind storm for all the rogue leaves in the same parking lot where the Citation was sitting. He wiped his eyes and looked all around. He did not remember driving here. He didn't even know where here was.
  The laptop was open in the passenger seat. He pushed some keys on the keyboard but it seemed it had run out of battery. The device sat in the floorboard, crumpled. The parking lot was mostly empty, a few cars here and there. Nice ones. A Lexus, a late-model Range Rover in burgundy, a silver BMW.
  His mouth was very dry and he had a crick in his neck from sleeping in the drivers seat all night. He got out of the car and stretched. The morning air was crisp and cold, the sky clear, a bright sun just over a huge, white office complex across the street. He waved his hands at the Mexican with the leaf blower. After several seconds of no acknowledgement he walked up and waved his hands directly in front of his face. The Mexican looked up, wearing safety glasses, and pulled one of the neon green earplugs out of his ear. He then switched off the blower and all of a sudden the man could hear again.
  "Where are we?"
  "Que?"
  "What is this place?"
  "Name this place?"
  "Yes. Si."
  "Avalon."
  "What?"
  "Avalon. Av-a-lon."
  He thanked him and the Mexican went back to work. He knew Avalon. It was an upscale outdoor shopping center in the next town over. Just opened, right after Thanksgiving. He had never been there, here. He had only heard the ads on the radio. He packed up the computer and device into the backpack, slung it over his shoulder, and walked towards what looked like the main entrance way, trying to remember why he had driven here the night before.
  It was very nice, much nicer than any mall or store he had ever been to. What struck him the most was how clean everything was. Some of that had to do with the newness of it. But part of it too was how expensive and refined the buildings were. It was like they had spared no expense. The buildings were all the same, a beige sandstone with dark gray trim. The concrete sidewalk was almost white and ever so often there would be a little Bradford Pear tree, its limbs barren now. But in springtime he knew it would be that much more fancy. At the end of the main block he spotted a place that looked open. There was a couple sitting outside, drinking smoothies. He decided to walk there to see if he could find a place to charge up the computer.
  The place was called Just Juice. The sign was bright orange and purple. He went inside where everything was very clean, just like outside. Like a museum. It felt so clean it made him uncomfortable, like he was contaminating the perfection of the place with his human body, with all its hair and sweat and skin. A young woman stood at the counter with a large smile.
  "Good Morning! Welcome to Just Juice. What can I get for you today, sir?"
  "You got coffee?"
  The woman closed her smile just a bit, and winced, as if she hated to have to give him bad news.
  "No sir, we're just juice. For breakfast we make really great smoothies. Would you like one of those?"
  "Yeah, I'll have a smoothie."
  "What flavor combination would you like this morning?"
  "What flavors you got?"
  She pointed to the sign above her.
  "I'll have the strawberry."
  "You get two flavors and one extra for a dollar."
  "Just double the strawberry."
  "Okay, sir. That'll be $5.99."
  While he waited he looked for an outlet but didn't see one inside. Out the window he saw an extension cord connected to a power strip, with a single fan hooked to it. He figured he could use one of those outlets. A few minutes later the woman handed him the smoothie and he went outside and sat around one of the tables with the umbrella in the middle, close enough that the power cord would reach to the extension cord. He took a sip of the smoothie but found it way too sweet. So he went back inside and ordered a water, just something to quench his dry mouth. Then he sat outside and let the computer charge, all while trying to remember what had brought him here the night before.
  And then he did remember. After leaving the house where he saw Suzanne and Joseph, and that guy James he had the radio on, and heard about a sale at Avalon for one of those video game systems that Joseph had been wanting. So he got on the road and drove here, not thinking the place would be closed. So he pulled into the parking lot and must have fallen asleep. There was a lot going on and he had the feeling that using the device might of had something to do with it too.
  A couple hours later it was warmer and the shopping center was picking up a crowd. The sidewalks were dotted with packs of families, groups of women, carrying bags, dressed to the nines in fancy clothes they probably bought here. He felt out of place but didn't feel like getting up at the moment. The computer was nearly charged. And then coming down the sidewalk he saw a woman by herself. He sat up and watched her approaching. There was something about the way her auburn hair blew in the wind and the way her thin figure filled out the peacoat she wore in just the right places, with just the right curves. Her delicate neck was exposed whenever the wind blew her hair the right way and her gloved hands he could tell were just as delicate.
  After pulling the device from the backpack he connected it to the fully charged computer and started up the program. This time using it there was barely any of the bottom of the ocean disorientation before things returned to normal and he focused on the woman on the sidewalk. He saw she was focused on having her phone repaired at the Apple store and buying a new gingham shirt for her husband at the J.Crew store. Then a late lunch at Farm to Ladle, maybe half an avocado caprese sandwich with a cup of their wonderful turkey chili. He looked closer and saw she that she resented her husband spending all his time away from their kids, working on the weekends, hanging out with business colleagues after hours to _network_. Closer still and he saw she sometimes wondered if she still loved him, if she would not have been happier with another man from her past, one who had stirred her heart and made her feel like everyday a new adventure. But he was a good provider, Robert, and they had built a wonderful life together. He bought her the Lexus she had her eyes on, the RX, and it was beautiful. She loved to drive it. And her children were getting a great education since they were able to afford a home in Glen Abbey and the schools in this area were the best in all of Georgia. There was a lot to be thankful for and she was thankful.
  "Excuse me, ma'am?"
  She looked startled, as if she had been awoken from a deep slumber, then turned to him, eyes flashing.
  "Oh, sorry, you scared me."
  "Oh I apologize. See I'm going to be doing a little shopping around here today and I was wondering if you might want to join me for a little while?"
  Her eyes dropped, in thought. Her lips pursed and she smiled warmly. Her left hand reached up and brushed the hair behind her ear.
  "Well I'm not sure, I was in a bit of a rush to run some errands and then head back to work. I have a meeting in a couple hours. I'd like to though."
  "It sure would be fun. I think it'd be more fun than going back to some boring old job."
  "Maybe. I mean yeah my job can be pretty boring. What did you say your name was?"
  "Well I didn't say. Do you want to know it?"
  She laughed.
  "Yes!"
  "Yours first."
  "Elizabeth."
  "Oh, Elizabeth. That was my mama's name."
  "No way! Was it really?"
  "No, her name was Donna, actually."
  She laughed again.
  "You are funny!"
  "No, I'm Will. Nice to meet you."
  He reached out his hand and she took it, softly shaking it.
  "Will. I like that name."
  "Do you?"
  "I do. Its very masculine."
  She bit her lip and smiled.
  "I guess I could come with you for awhile. Where do you want to go?"
  "There's a store around here that's supposed to have a deal on the Nintendo Switch, some video game thing. Gonna pick up one of those for my boy."
  "Oh my sons got a Switch for Christmas. They absolutely love it! Was the store GameStop by any chance? There is one a couple blocks over there. We could try?"
  "I think it was GameStop, yeah."
  Elizabeth took him by the hand and led him across the street to a cross-section where there was a large kiosk with a diagram of the entire place. She found the GameStop and their location in Avalon. They walked that way, admiring how blue the sky was today and how warm the sun was on their faces. In the store they found the Nintendo Switch on sale. He got one and a couple of games to go with it. When they got to the register Elizabeth reached into her purse and brought out a credit card.
  "Let me get this for you."
  "I have money. I can buy it."
  "No but I want to. It's no problem."
  He nodded and after a moment of hesitation, acquiesced.
  She paid for the console and games and after they carried the bag to his car and placed it in the trunk.
  "Will, I just thought about something."
	"What is that?"
	"Does Joseph have a television to play the video games on?"
	"I honestly have no idea."
	"Don't you think maybe we should get a television for him just in case? It wouldn't make sense to have the video game console without a television to play it on."
	He thought about it.
	"That does make sense. Do you know any stores around here that sell televisions?"
	She looked around her. Then pointed past the parking deck.
	"Over there is the Best Buy. They sell electronics, home decor, everything like that."
	"You sure are a kind and thoughtful woman," he said, "I think I like you."
	She seemed embarrassed and took his hand again.
	"I think I like you too."
	They walked to the store, a large warehouse building on the other side of Avalon. Shoppers zipped around them, on foot, in cars, a security guard went past on a Segway, the red light on the handle flashing. They crossed a large intersection and walked into the main entrance. Elizabeth took a shopping cart from the line of them in the lobby and they entered.
	Inside it was very bright. There were electronics everywhere, of every kind. Smartphones, digital DSLR cameras, computers, laptops, tablets, video games, washer and dryers, refrigerators, car audio stereos and speakers, and at the back there were rows and rows of high definition television sets, all playing the same movie, of a man and his son flying a kite in a field. The workers in blue shirts approached them but Elizabeth waved them away. In here, just like in the juice bar, he felt unclean. The place was so sanitary and perfect and he was not. He felt as if he didn't belong here. At that moment he felt Elizabeth squeeze his hand as if to say, _You are perfect just as you are and you do belong here, next to me_.
	They looked at the televisions. He found a nice 42-inch one with vibrant colors that was not too expensive. He wanted to be modest, didn't want to make a big showing of it and get a 60-incher, though he could afford it. Besides 42-inches should be all Joseph needs in his room. He voiced his concerns to Elizabeth and she agreed. Better to be modest. They grabbed the ticket and started to head for the register but it occurred to him that Joseph might not have a place to set the television. He hadn't even considered that before.
	"It's no problem," Elizabeth assured him, "They have entertainment centers here. It's a small selection but I bet we can find something that Joseph will like."
	There were five entertainment centers that he liked. The best one was one with a wooden frame and a black glass top, sitting only a few feet high, but with plenty of shelving space for a game system, games, and anything else he might get later. That was important to consider, not just what's good for today but what's good for a year from now, two years from now. Elizabeth agreed with him on this point too. They grabbed a ticket for the one he liked and made their way to the register.
	The man who checked them out asked if they wanted to insure the items for up to two years, for only a little more money. He thought that was a good idea but looked to Elizabeth to make sure she agreed, since she was the one making the purchase, and she did agree, so they added it. They told him to drive around the side so they could load up the television and entertainment center into his car.
	"We walked here from the other side of Avalon. Can one of your guys go get the car while we wait here? It's a long way to walk."
	"Of course, sir. That's no problem. I'll just need your keys."
	He handed them over and described where the car was and what it looked like. The man handed the keys off to some kid from the back room wearing the same blue shirt, and he took off, running through the parking lot as fast as he could, arms and legs pumping. Meanwhile he and Elizabeth walked outside. Elizabeth saw a small stand of neon lighted keychains.
	"Oh, these are wonderful. Don't you think so, Will?"
	"They are. I'd like to have one of those on my keychain."
	He turned back to the man at the register, had to wave to get his attention.
	"Sir, would it be okay if we take these?"
	The man nodded.
	"Sure, that's no problem."
	He picked up the stand and found that it wasn't as heavy as it looked. The keychains jangled around but none of them fell off. They took the stand and sat on the curb for a few minutes, waiting for the driver. He soon pulled up and two other men, wearing back braces, pushed over the television and entertainment center, on carts, and lifted them into the trunk. When they were done they thanked them and got in.
	He drove around to the place in the parking lot where her car was. The parking lot was full and there were people everywhere, much different from the morning. They got out and he helped her put the stand of keychains in the back of the Lexus. The car smelled new inside. Then he shut the hatch and walked over to Elizabeth. They hugged. She squeezed him tightly. He squeezed back.
	"I don't want to say goodbye."
	"Me neither."
	"This feels so real. So right."
	"I know."
	They pulled away and stared at one another. There was a youthful glow in her face and eyes, her lips full. His heart was filled with a longing to be with her, to take care of her, and devote his life to her alone. The feeling was a mixture of sexual longing and spiritual fulfillment and left him feeling euphoric. And somehow he knew she was feeling the same thing.
	"Spend some time with me. Let's go for an early dinner."
	"Okay," she replied, softly, eagerly.
	"Can I ask you a question?"
	"Yes."
	"May I call you Suzanne?"
	She looked him in the eyes and exhaled, as if she had been waiting for that question for an eternity.
	"I'd like that. Very much."
	It was late in the afternoon and long shadows fell over the buildings and the sidewalks where they walked through Avalon to the center courtyard. Here there were several upscale restaurants, open but not busy yet, setting up tables and preparing for the evening. A fountain in the center of the courtyard erupted from time to time in a series of vertical jets. As they walked around the fountain he thought it would be fun to try to walk on those jets as they erupted. He climbed up on the stone guardrail and waited for the right moment and then when the first jet shot up he hopped onto it with one foot and it pushed him about ten feet into the air. When that jet reached its crest, he hopped onto the next one, which was just a bit higher, and then the next one, until he was on the center one just as it was coming down. But he didn't want to get wet in the pool so he reached out and grabbed the guardrail and heaved himself over the side, back onto the walkway. Then he rejoined Suzanne and they continued to the restaurant.
	It was a small Italian place, Colleta, and they were seated without delay by a supremely courteous and professional waiter with hair slicked back, white shirt, black slacks. On the table they found breadsticks waiting for them. Goblets of water filled to the brim. He walked around and pulled the chair for her and she gave a small curtsey as she sat down. This was a clean place, dimly lit, walls clay-colored, decorated with paintings of the old world, lined with plants and vines. They looked through the menu and in the meantime ordered a bottle of red wine, sommelier's choice. When they had ordered there was a lull where it seemed obvious this was not some fantasy but a real thing. He felt as close to her as he had felt to any person in his life. He felt like anything he would say would be right and anything he said would be true.
	"Tell me about you. I want to know everything. Who are you?"
	She met his gaze with one as equally sincere. They shared a silence which might have been eternal. There was a patience in it, a complete lack of anticipation, as if all was already fulfilled and there was nothing else lacking. Once again he admired her body, her beautiful face, so lithe and youthful, though she had to be his age. He knew she had children. Her eyes contained a mutual understand that he had never experienced before.
	"Nothing before today exists. Nothing before this time we have together is real. Don't you feel that way?"
	He thought about it, a strange thing to consider, but it didn't sound strange whatsoever coming from her.
	"I do feel that way. The only thing that exists is us, together. Suzanne."
	As he pronounced her name she sighed. A waiter came to take their dinner order. After he excused himself to the bathroom. He found it at the back of the place, a unisex toilet. He did his business and washed his hands and looked into the mirror. He found his expression hard to understand. He looked happy. For the first time in a long time.
	_When it happens it happens like this_, he told himself, both in the dream and aware of it too. And then he returned to their table to find Suzanne waiting for him, two glasses of red wine filled in front of them. They toasted and drank. It was good. The wine was very good. They talked but it didn't even register to him what they spoke about. He was overcome by the feeling of belonging. Belonging to her. The security of that feeling, of knowing she would be there, by his side, until the end of time if it came to that. At least that long. He did not believe in God but he found in this feeling something like that which his Baptist friends had always spoken, a feeling of the eternal in a single moment of time.
	Two waiters brought the food, from the kitchen. Trays of expensive meats, roasted, piled high. They brought over loaves of bread, golden baked and smothered in butter. Others were seated at their table. That didn't matter to them. They brought dishes of casserole and salads, fresh vegetables cut and soaked in oil and vinegar. He loaded a plate and began eating. He stuffed himself and then went back for seconds. The others at the table did the same. They spoke to their table mates as brethren, as if they had known them forever, and talked about Avalon and the larger city around them, and then of universal things, of God whose existence they were all sure about.
	When they were finished with dinner he rose and helped Suzanne from her chair and led her to the Citation next to the table. She got in and he drove them to the exit. But there were many people in the way, waiting to get a table at the restaurant. His car turned down narrow isles of the tables, trying to find the exit. People in the booths were watching them.
	But it was too much.
	"We'll never get out of here. There are too many people."
	He agreed with Suzanne. It seemed to him like it would be better to rise above them, to float, and he grabbed her hand warmly and thought about rising out of the Citation, and they did. They rose out of the car and the crowd in the restaurant. They flew above all of that so that they could observe it from a distance, the tops of their heads at the bar, the bustle of the staff, they floated above it all. And out of Colleta, into the square at Avalon. It was dark. The lights of the storefronts and the sidewalk illuminated the night with a warm, incandescent glow. They both, hand in hand, rose above it all. They exchanged glances of perfect understanding as they flew over the buildings and the parking lot. He felt her hand squeeze his, telling him she wished to descend, and they did, into a side street.
	They were walking through a round building, the walls smooth and curved. People there did not seem to recognize them and looked at them as if they were strangers. They came to a place which was partitioned into corridors with makeshift panels, human in height.
	"I want to do this."
	She told him this and immediately his heart sank, because he knew he couldn't stop her, and there was a part of him that didn't want to stop her, because their connection was deeper than any intellectual understanding of right and wrong.
	So they got in line. And before them and behind him were others, junkies, talking about their addiction. About the best way to get the best high, and he felt again as if he didn't belong here, but he held onto Suzanne. She was excited. The nurse in line asked them why they were here.
	"I am addicted and need it to get through the day."
	The nurse wrote this down and her assistant next to her reminded them that they needed to hand over all personal belongings. So they both handed over the contents of their pockets, his wallet and keys, her purse and coins from her pockets. That was everything they had. Then they were in line awaiting the dispensing of the drug. The choice was meth or heroin. He knew she would choose the meth. And she did. The nurse handed her the small cup, filled with the granulated bits, pale blue in color. When Suzanne held the cup she ran a finger through it, and then dumped the entire contents of the cup into her mouth and swallowed.
	"You took too much. That was for us both. But you took it all."
	But Suzanne was somewhere else. She was in a place he had not been invited to. Alone. He knew then his role was to protect her from any harm, to watch over her as she went on this journey, this trip into the unknown. He was afraid she would die. And that if she died he would be alone. He wrapped his arm around her waist and walked her outside the partitions, wondering to himself how and why this was legal. It seemed to be something new, something beyond him.
	And then it took hold. He looked at her and did not recognize the woman whom he had fallen in love with, any kind of closeness. They were on a beach in an empty stretch of land somewhere in Florida. The rocks on the beach hurt his feet but he still walked beside her. The sky and the beach and the horizon in between was all he could see. She ran away from him. He took off after and ran until once again he was in a building surrounded by people. He caught her by the shoulder and she turned and he could see that she was not breathing right. Her breaths were shallow, her body was not getting enough oxygen to keep her alive. He panicked. She was crying, regretting that she had taken the meth in the first place. But it was too late.
	He decided to take her to an infirmary which was in the circular building. They walked the corridors, panicked, trying to hold it together. They came to a place with social workers behind counters, even a police officer behind the counter. This was the place where they could get help for her condition. It seemed very important they get seen as soon as possible, because he knew she may not live. He ran his hand across her back and felt the shallow breaths. He felt like she was not getting the oxygen she needed to live and this to him felt like his own death because somehow their lives had been bound together and he had no life of his own, without hers.
	At the counter the woman was very kind, and did not panic when he told her of the condition of Suzanne, who was now pale and whose breaths were rapid and shallow. She said they could help the addiction and that it was no problem. Behind the woman in the counter a shape emerged, wearing a robe and whose face could not be seen inside the hood of the robe.
	It emerged from behind the counter and was behind Suzanne. He watched with concern and curiosity. He wanted very much for her to survive, to be okay. The being in the robe as it approached loomed over her body. It was at that time that he realized the robe was not cloth. It was not a robe at all. It was flesh, the being itself. And the hood was not a hood but the face itself, and the darkness within was not hiding some other form but nothingness. The being knelt and as it knelt Suzanne fell to the floor and curled up. Then the hooded being hovered over her sleeping body. The hood or what he understood to be the hood but was really the face, the flaps of skin, enveloped her face and her entire head and adhered to the shape of her head. And then it seemed as if it were feeding or if not feeding then extracting the contamination from her being. That being it became clear to him fed on the contamination of others.
	He saw her body lying there, on the floor of the building, that being with its fleshy flaps of skin wrapped around her head, something was going on that he had no way to comprehend. So he accepted it, and prayed for the best.
	And then she was awake. And once again she was in his arms and when he looked at her he recognized the soul which stared back at him. And he felt relief. But she was very tired so he suggested they get a hotel room. And she agreed to that, being very tired and unable to make plans.
	Into the lobby they walked arm in arm. He held her as if he were holding a wounded soldier, someone vulnerable, someone dependent who had once been strong. They approached the counter and he asked for a room. The rooms at this short notice were not cheap, nearly three hundred dollars but he said the price was fine. And the person checked them in and handed him the key and told them the best route to get to the room.
	He took her to the room, swiping the card over the panel with the light which turned green. He brought her inside and let her collapse onto the bed. She thanked him for all he had done for her and even apologized for the trouble she had caused. But for him it had been no trouble. And he told her that. She smiled a warm smile. He went the window and closed the curtain where the lights from the storefronts and parking lot could be seen. He turned the heater up and went into the hallway to fill the ice bucket for the Chardonnay he had sent up during checkin. When he returned she was already under the covers and the look on her face was telling him to join her there. So he did.
	Her skin against his was warm, almost hot. Her breasts soft, he cupped them and kissed them gently. She had undone her hair and her locks spread onto the pillow as if she were a mermaid floating under the ocean. She pulled him to her and kissed him. He felt her lips part and then her tongue entwined with his. None of this seemed real to him. Yet it was. She unzipped her skirt and pulled it down, around her hips, exposing black lace panties. He took off his jeans and kicked them off the bed, laughing. She laughed too and they held one another tighter, her legs wrapping around him, squeezing into him. He gripped her ass and heaved himself into her. He lost his breath during one of their kisses and rested his head momentarily on her shoulder and neck, breathing deeply in. He kissed her shoulder and then neck and then moved to her earlobes and his hands were exploring every sensual place on her body. They removed the rest of their clothing and he took one moment to look at her in this dim light and admire her body and her beauty and the look of complete love and understanding she was giving. And then he took her. And she took him. And they lost themselves in each other until he no longer knew he was himself and she no longer knew she was herself and he knew all her thoughts and feelings and she knew his and everything was communicated between them with looks and simple gestures. And she repeated his name Will and he repeated her name Suzanne and that was the last thing they remembered before sleep took them.
	The drawing of the curtains woke him in the morning. It must have been early because the sky was orange pink with low winter clouds moving by outside the large window. She returned to the bed and sat on the edge, away from him. Her skirt was on, her bra and blouse were not, back and shoulders bare. Her head was bowed. He reached out to touch her back. As he did so she jerked away with disdain and he heard her sobbing into her hands.
	"Suzanne."
	She stood and found her bra and blouse on the floor and put them on, covering her breasts as if ashamed. For the first time this morning he saw her eyes. She was panicked, frightened, disoriented. She barely knew he was there at all. She received a notification on her cell phone and went to the table to look at it. Her eyes welled, reddened from the crying she had already done this morning.
	"Suzanne. Say something."
	Every time he addressed him she winced as if it caused her pain. She continued to dress, slipping on her pumps and picking up her purse from the desk chair. He rose from the bed and tried to address her more directly. She read the messages on her phone and a fearful look came over her.
	"What have I done?"
	She left. He was in the room alone. He went to the window and looked out at the day, commuters entering and leaving Avalon, the thin branches moving in the air, a kitchen worker carrying out the trash, his breath like smoke. Then he saw her stumbling through the parking lot, in a half run half walk. Distracted. A car pulled out of its spot and nearly hit her. He could see she was crying freely now, wretched. She got into the Lexus and backed out and then accelerated through the parking lot to the exit. She ran the red light and cut off an oncoming car as she pulled into the main road. The car honked but she sped away, weaving in and out of lanes.

  Sleeting. He parked in the same location he had found the other night, where the car would be well hidden behind some trees and bushes. Dinnertime across the street. He saw the light in the window from the kitchen where Suzanne was washing the dishes. James was clearing the table. He donned his hood to keep the sleet out of his face and brought over the gifts, still in their boxes, and set them on the porch in a place where he knew they wouldn't get wet. It took him three trips and he stumbled a couple times in the dark but his fear had not been realized. Nobody came outside. Nobody saw him. Tomorrow morning they would discover the gifts for Joseph on the porch. Cold rain on his jacket, soaking through the hood, the shoulders, feeling the wet and the cold on his skin, he headed back to the car so he could drive into town to find a room, a place to warm up and dry out on this dreary night. But as he turned to go he saw a light in the bedroom nearest to the porch. He approached the window, kneeling, and peered inside. His boy, playing with Legos on the floor, building something that looked to be half rocket ship, half monster. He was in pajamas so it must be bedtime soon. His mother had always been a stickler for that. It broke his heart to see how much he had grown since the last time he saw him, maybe a year already. Maybe longer. His hair was less blonde, brown, his arms and legs lanky now. He wondered if he was still the same boy who used to climb onto the couch and cuddle in his lap as they watched tv, whose head lay against his chest, rising and falling with his breaths, who lifted his work shirt and jiggled his belly with his hand and told him he needed to lose some weight, daddy. He felt a longing that opened up inside him like a bottomless hole. He wanted so much to hold onto this moment forever. To keep it with him always. And not like you keep a memory but like you would keep a living thing. To have it. But then he understood for the first time in his forty-plus years on Earth that a moment in time was not something you could ever possess. It was not yours to keep. It was a gift. Given to you and then taken away. At that point Joseph looked up from his Legos and saw his father standing outside the window in the sleet and the cold and the dark. He was startled at first but then grew calm. A faint smile appeared on his face as he rose and walked nearer to the window. He reached out and touched the window and his father reached out and did the same, and only a pane of glass was between them.

  The clerk hadn't given him the correct room key so he had to walk back to the office in the rain and get the correct one. In one hand he carried a plastic sack from Walmart, the key in the other, backpack slung over his shoulder. He went back to 23 and found the keyhole with the lights in the parking lot and went inside and turned on the heater unit and lay on the bed. He was tired and soon fell asleep. In the middle of the night he awoke, not feeling very rested, and removed the computer from the bag and set it up on the bed beside him. He removed the burner phone from the plastic sack and unboxed it. Then he went online to activate it, being sure to not use any personal data at any step so it couldn't be traced back to him. He paid cash for it.
  When it was activated he tested it by sending a text to himself and it arrived. Then he found where he had written down Grady's cell phone number in a text file on the desktop.
  
  _Have computer. Will sell. 1 million._

  What he decided to leave out at this juncture was that he was also in possession of the device, which was arguably the most valuable piece to the puzzle. The computer itself wasn't valuable except for the program, which could easily be copied to another computer, and the notes left by Zoey Jackson. But even a dumbass like him had figured it out without understanding all the technical stuff so it must not be too critical. His plan was to inform them about the device during the transaction for the computer. Once he had the cash in hand it would ensure his safety until he figured out how to proceed from there. If they didn't balk at the one million who knows how much he'd ask for then. Half an hour passed and he was becoming worried they might have gotten rid of Grady's cell phone. But then the phone lit up with a chime and vibration. He picked it up from where it lay on the bed.
  
  _Yes. Agreed._
  
  He decided not to respond right away. To leave them on the hook. This was something he'd learned slinging dope to fiends. Dangle a carrot in front of their faces and then jerk it away right when they go to grab it. Would drive some of them batshit. He hoped it would do the same here. Not to fuck with them. To make them sloppy. To give something away he could use against them. So he lay back on the bed and looked at the cracks in the ceiling, at the bug carcasses on the bottom of the ceiling light fixture. He listened to the argument in the room next to him. A man and woman, speaking Spanish. He wondered what it was they were saying to each other. He heard their anger and frustration and wanted to know the details of the argument. Then in the next moment decided that it was not worth it. None of it. The tendrils which reached out from his being and united him to other beings and the machinery of life. To let that go. To withdraw those tendrils and retreat into the void. He felt like he could do that. That he wanted it to happen.
  He awoke several hours later, just before sunrise. Outside the light was gray and dull. Everything still damp from the rains the night before. He looked at the phone and saw two other texts.
  
  _Where and when?_
  
  And then,
  
  _Please reply soon._
  
  This was what he wanted to see. He decided to wait even longer to reply and thought about where and when this deal should happen. He had the idea to meet in his usual location on the west side of town, but now he was thinking somewhere further out would be better. Somewhere he knew the roads and where there were plenty of places for him to disappear after. He thought of the old rock quarry. It was a place he and his buddies used to go on Friday nights to drink beer and smoke pot. They'd make a big fire right near the edge of the quarry, a sheer seventy foot drop to the bottom where there was a shallow lake. He browsed to the map application and studied the roads in and out of the quarry, looking at the GPS satellite images of the place. It hadn't changed much from what he could see. But he should go out there first at least.
  A message prompt popped up on the chat application which started up automatically whenever a user was logged in.
  
  _duckdodgers2450@protonmail.com wants to be your friend. Do you accept this request?_
  
  Panic. Had he been discovered? Did they know where he was? Was he in danger? These questions went through his mind as he stared at the message. He clicked Yes and held his breath as the user was added to the list of friends. A few seconds later and a chat window opened.
  
	duckdodgers2450: who r u
	duckdodgers2450: do u have the device

  He began typing _Yes_ but then deleted his message. Whoever this was, it was not _them_. He was sure of that. The screenname, the slang, the tone of it was all different. His first thought was that maybe one of Zoey Jackson's colleagues had been working with her and escaped, perhaps. He typed again.

	z.jackson: Yes
	
	Immediately came a reply.
	
	duckdodgers2450: who r u
	
	He thought for a moment and then responded.
	
	z.jackson: computer and device are for sale. 3 million cash
	
	Time passed. Several messages were started but then cancelled by the person. Then a string of them.
	
	duckdodgers2450: wtf
	duckdodgers2450: WHO R U
	duckdodgers2450: prove u have the device

	He wrote back a quick reply.
	
	z.jackson: pink hat with cat ears
	
	Here there was a long delay. Nothing. And then.
	
	duckdodgers2450: u r in danger. do NOT sell to any1
	
	After an hour passed of him becoming more unsure of himself and feeling the situation was out of his control he broke down and wrote back.
	
	z.jackson: are you still there? how am I in danger?
	z.jackson: can we meet?
	
	Then fifteen minutes there was a reply, but it was not an answer to anything.
	
	duckdodgers2450: check email pls
	duckdodgers2450: did u get it
	
	He opened the Mail app on the dock at the bottom of the screen and checked the email. There at the top, in bolded letters, an unread email from duckdodgers2450@protonmail.com. He hesitated a moment then opened the message. It was empty. At that point he received another message.
	
	duckdodgers2450: did u get it. answer now
	z.jackson: yes, nothing there
	
	Another reply came. Now their conversation was moving at a realtime pace.
	
	duckdodgers2450: should be an attachment. aura2
	z.jackson: yes. I see the file.
	duckdodgers2450: dl file to yr desktop and run
	z.jackson: I don't know what you mean.
	duckdodgers2450: its an exe, open iTerm and run with sudo
	z.jackson: sorry I'm not a computer guy. I don't know what you are telling me.
	duckdodgers2450: click the iTerm application in the dock. Let me know when its open, black box on screen with cursor
	z.jackson: ok, its open, says Last login: Tue Jan 13 19:23:27 on ttys000
	duckdodgers2450: type in 'sudo ~/Desktop/aura2' -- no quotes
	z.jackson: asking for password
	duckdodgers2450: silver55
	z.jackson: says, 'sudo: /Users/z.jackson/Desktop/aura2: command not found'
	duckdodgers2450: did u copy aura2 to desktop?
	z.jackson: no, should I?
	duckdodgers2450: yes pls
	z.jackson: ok, its there
	duckdodgers2450: type in 'sudo ~/Desktop/aura2' -- no quotes
	z.jackson: worked, I think. Now says Please connect device, should I do that first?
	duckdodgers2450: yes pls
	z.jackson: says Device is ready
	duckdodgers2450: ok. what wallpaper is on the desktop?
	z.jackson: old photo, birthday party, black girl with family and friends
	duckdodgers2450: good. put on device and focus on image of girl in the photo.
	
	He held the knitted pink cap in his hand and re-read the messages, unsure about all of this. But someone out there understood this device better than him and was warning him of being in danger, and this person as far as he knew hadn't murdered anybody. And then one more message.
	
	duckdodgers2450: don't panic
	
	At least he thought this person wasn't connected to those others. It was not much, just an intuition, but he decided to go with his gut. That same feeling he had in the hotel with the pimp, of letting go completely. He put on the hat. This time there was barely any of the underwater lag, even less than the last time. A few minutes later he was staring at the screen and photo. But now the photo was coming into and going out of focus and the people in the photo had that same dimensionality he saw in the real world. And even more than that it seemed as if the photo was in motion. The candles on the birthday cake flickered, the breeze blew a woman's flower dress around her legs, the trees in the background swayed, random cars in the background went past, the children in mid laugh and clapping their hands with joy, and the birthday girl  in that white dress, her eyes shut, blowing out the candles, her mouth pursed like a duck, happy as a camper, with her family on either side. 
	
	It was her.

  As he focused on the girl in the photograph time seemed to speed up. The only way he could tell time was passing were the visions of things passing by him, as if he were on a speeding train looking out the window at things going by. The thing was he knew he was not going anywhere. He felt the bed, his foot on the floor. He knew he was still in the hotel room. The images he was seeing seemed to be hers but he could not make any sense of them. And when at last he had reached a terminal velocity things stopped moving abruptly and he found himself within a large kaleidoscopic and fractal world, which he saw even when he shut his eyes. In other words this world existed somewhere within his own mind. And whenever he focused on some portion of the puzzle the pieces of it ordered themselves and began make some kind of sense to him. He looked one way and saw a tree and a barn and birds in the air all come together in a waterfall of colors and sounds, and then he saw a path with a boy and a man walking together on a path through the woods. Another way he saw a Ferris wheel and cotton candy and holding hands with someone, mother, and the lights blinking on the rides and the vaguely sick feeling from eating too much fried food and sugar. The sounds were also fragmented but not chaotic like the visuals. The sounds blended into something akin to a low drone or humming and then out of that drone the sounds  would come into focus more clear so you could hear the sound of the bird song or the carnival music, all out of that one sound.
  He was not alone. She was also here. And the frightening thing he started to realize was that this mosaic world also contained his own thoughts, experiences, dreams and memories. And she was free to focus on any of them at will. There was no way to keep anything from her. The very act of establishing the communication had granted her permission to the most secret places of his mind. Yet somehow it didn't matter. Because he knew that here in this world there was no judgement. It was not like the other world. It was difficult to put into words but it was something like this world and its contents of the mind was not his nor hers. The sins he had committed in his life were laid bare as were her sins. And likewise the beautiful things she had seen and accomplished were his and vice versa. And when he witnessed them he felt all the same feelings she had felt and it was like it had all happened to him. So there was no embarrassment, no guilt, only a feeling of total acceptance and whenever necessary, forgiveness.
  He wanted to have a conversation with her but he soon realized that would not be possible here, in the way he would have preferred to communicate. He sensed that she too wanted to converse with him. To communicate with words alone would not fit this place because as he realized words are man-made symbols which represent things, thoughts, emotions in the phenomenal world, and they would not be understood here in quite the same way. It wasn't that he no longer understood words or how to speak them. But for example, because here the word _car_ was not just the word-symbol for an automobile but it was also every memory, fear, dream associated with all the specific automobiles in your life and the life of the person you were in communion with. Nothing here existed as a concept and couldn't be used in that way. There were only the objects themselves, phenomenon. Another way to say it would be that there were no symbols. Everything was a relationship between the thing and your being. So to construct a sentence like 'Meet me at the Cracker Barrel on Sunday morning' would not be possible. It was not even necessary, since time and space had no meaning in this place. Everything here was one experience, all present, all now. You could partake in a dream you once had of flying like a bird over Santiago, Chile, just as easily as revisiting the actual memory of sitting up with your grandmother in the nursing home as she drew her last breaths.
  None of this he understood but felt it like an instinct. It all came very naturally and he was not overwhelmed by the strange things he saw. She must have understood even more, though, because she had already figured out how to communicate here and it was by guiding focus. If you wanted to communicate something you only had to suggest some area of the kaleidoscopic world to focus on and the suggestion could be accepted or not. You could not force anything. It was not like the things he had done to those people, where he filled their minds with suggestions they enacted in the phenomenal world. There was no control because there was nothing to distinguish another. It was all one mind and he was an impulse in this mind and she another.
  She guided him to a moment from her past. To show she came to discover and develop the technology which allowed tapping into the stream, which she had nicknamed Aura. He allowed her to show him and saw the space in front of his eyes spiral into objects and shapes he recognized and then he saw her walking alone through the woods in the dry leaves and the cold air behind the research facility. It was a clear day and she needed time to clear her head from the jumble of work of that day. Nobody else ever came out here so it was a place she could be alone with her thoughts, and it was here she had the epiphany. She hurried back to her cubicle and pulled from a shelf the first book her father had given her when she showed an interest in computers, _Fractal Programming in C_. She found the formulas for Mandelbrot and Julia and compared them against the work she had done to aggregate output from the neuroimaging data streams. The patterns definitely mimicked fractals. But there didn't seem to be any rhyme or reason to why it worked that way, that she could see at first glance. But this was the connection she had been looking for. If the brain generated a stream of data there were a couple questions she had. One, what was the content of this data and two, was there anyway to interface with it.
  Much later in the same cubicle she was there with the old woman she paid to run the experiments on. The first generation of the device was on the desk. They were taking a break, drinking coke and eating a sandwich from the vending machine. She was excitedly talking about the potential of the device to the woman, who did not seem to understand nor care really. To her it was a chance to sit in the air-conditioned building for a few hours on the weekend, get a free meal, and a few bucks for cigarettes. 
  "The problem as I now understand it is application. I wrote the algorithm to interface with the data stream, which was essentially a reverse-engineered inverse of the output, fed back into it, not unlike noise-cancelling headphones, yet instead of cancelling out it merges and creates a real-time channel. This is how I'm able to know what you're thinking."
  "I'm gonna go outside and smoke. You wanna come?"
  She declined and kept going over the problem in her head. The problem was the channel is only one-way. The possibilities for abuse of such a technology were staggering. In fact she couldn't think of a single positive application of such a tool, except as an invasion of privacy, a weapon, both on a personal level and on the level of governmental control. Terrorism. Though she wouldn't admit it to herself she was looking for a single good reason to keep the project alive. Despite the data she had to believe it was possible for there to be two-way communication via the Aura channel. The other problem was simpler but no less troubling. She knew that at least in theory the data did not require a physical cable between the electrodes. The same information could be transmitted wirelessly. And at the same time she was thinking this she was interrupted by the second epiphany.
  Months passed and the device was now embedded in the knitted pink hat that he recognized. He watched her as she went around the daily work day, pretending to be engaged in the comparatively mundane work of controlling commerce and social media applications by interpreting output of the brainwave imaging. She borrowed time during late nights and on the weekend. Whatever objections her conscience made about using the groups computers and lab equipment were overruled by the sheer excitement. He found he could share her excitement. He felt that euphoric joy she felt when she finally figured out how to go wireless. It was like every step she took forward opened up new possibilities and new problems to solve. Her brain was constantly turning over the problems, examining them as thought experiments. She didn't understand why it worked but it did. It took everything she had not to tell Richard, who used to do crazy experiments in the lab all the time back at Tech. The number one problem was always how to create a two-way communication channel. She knew only once that problem was solved would she approach anyone to let them in. She also had to figure out how to ensure the technology would not be sold or abused. She did not, and had not ever, trusted the Andromeda Group. She knew their interest in this entire field was not the betterment of humanity as much as how to more efficiently deliver advertising and therefore make more money for the shareholders and therefore themselves. This thought depressed her. One Friday evening she was at the lab alone, having too much whisky, when she got the idea to write an email to her colleagues and managers. She addressed it to the entire group with the subject line, _The Future of this Lab: A Manifesto_.
  
To my fellow researchers and staff,

I felt inspired to write you all and say something that's been on my mind. Since I've been here I've recognized something disturbing in the hallways, in the lab, in the meeting rooms, and even in the break rooms of this place that I can no longer ignore, the unwritten law we are all expected to follow without question. In case you don't know what I'm talking about, it is this, 

_The only idea worth spending time on is that which has the potential to make money, by either direct or indirect means_.

Any other kind of idea is a waste of time. Any other idea is pointless. How many times have I come here excited about some new, admittedly stupid idea and rush to tell all my colleagues about it only to be met with apathy and impatience. But if I say  that same stupid idea has potential to make money, or say that it could be a business, those same eyes light up and at that moment you see what truly stirs their souls. The promise of wealth, riches, an easy life. We have to stop this. We have to encourage each other to do _pointless_ work. Work whose only purpose is that it makes us see the world from a different perspective, or from a new angle. The pursuit of wealth creates an limiting barrier. It boxes us in. It holds us back from realizing our true potential! I felt compelled to write this letter to say it out loud, at least one time, that this is wrong, and more than wrong, its fucking bullshit! We are men and women of science. We have such powerful tools at our disposal and such powerful minds to utilize them and we're spending our time and energy figuring out how to extract yet more money out of people? So consider this a manifesto. Resist it. Speak out against it. Do the work that inspires the part of you that wants to understand the world from a new perspective, not the part of you that merely wants to survive. Work towards creating a better world for our children. One that isn't just based on money at the expense of everything else. I promise I will from this point forward.

Zoey Jackson
  
  To this email, sent to the entire Andromeda Research team, about fifty to seventy five employees, managers, and directors, she received no reply, except for one, a reply from Richard Dewey, her immediate supervisor, who asked her to come talk to him on Monday morning.
  After this debacle she began to feel very protective of the Aura project and grew paranoid about ways it could be discovered before she was ready. She hid all the files in secret places on her hard drive. The one weak point was that she needed subjects to run tests on. And that created a security hole, since she didn't feel like she could trust the old woman who had been helping her. She was not reliable and could easily be bought. She couldn't go through the normal channels by which they hired human guinea pigs. She thought to put up an ad on Craigslist but that seemed like a bad idea waiting to happen. These things were on her mind when she landed on the third epiphany of this project.
  It started as an insane idea, even to her, coming to her in a state of nodding off one weekend, the device still on her head. In this dream she made a bizarre step of logic that the stream was not necessarily bound to the same physics as normal electricity and that maybe it wasn't necessary at all to be in proximity to the subject. As long as your own stream was reaching out with a particular pattern (which so far seemed to be unique to each person) it would latch on. But how would the software get the initial data to run through the algorithm to produce the connection stream? Here was the major leap. That it was incidental the stream uses electric waves. Since she really didn't understand the mechanism that well, then why the hell shouldn't it work? Maybe just focusing on a particular subject would be enough to receive the stream data. When she awoke the idea seemed very stupid and she couldn't even remember it over her breakfast of coffee and toast that morning. But that next evening, in the dark hours, the idea came again. So wild and out there and frankly insane that she laughed. But she had an itch that night to do something wild and out there and frankly insane. So she modified the software and placed the device on her head. She turned it on and closed her eyes and focused her mind on the old woman who had been helping her. She had no idea where she was or what she was doing. It didn't work. But she felt the stream attempting to do something. She wasn't feeling very imaginative tonight, her brain was tired from being on inventory duty earlier that day. So she opened one of the videos logs of the woman and paused it when she could see her face. At that moment she had to laugh as she realized the utter ridiculousness of what she was doing.
  "Is this real science?" She asked the empty building.
  And a few moments later replied, "Bet your ass it is."
  Then she switched on the software, adjusted the device on her head, and focused intently on the old woman's face. And she was there, her mind available just as it was when she was sitting on the opposite side of the table, wires connected. She re-observed some of the same memories she had previously documented from their experiments, to verify what she was seeing. And then abruptly shut off the device. Within her was a feeling like what she was doing was unethical. Immoral really. An immense invasion of privacy. But the technology worked. It really did. She also felt an obligation to develop this idea in private. In the wrong hands or without proper understanding this tool could have devastating results.
  She did not yet feel comfortable sharing her research with the Andromeda Group. And in fact, even when she was ready, she would approach her friend Richard first. But not yet. First she needed to verify once and for all that it was possible to observe the mind of someone who was not even present. This technology, properly utilized, could connect people from different socioeconomic backgrounds, cultures. Because of the empathy which was the true foundation of the technology, for the first time misunderstandings could be resolved. The possibilities seemed mind-boggling and she did not let herself go there just yet. She needed to do one more test to make her case, ethics be damned. She made a few conditions and documented them well. This person should be a public figure, one who has already made the decision to trade privacy for the spotlight. The other condition was that it should be a person she knew to be antithetical to her own belief system. If the value of this tool was empathy, then there was no better test to see if she could achieve understanding herself, by opening a channel to someone who stood for everything she hated. It did not take her long to find him.
  This man of business. This old white man, born with a silver spoon in his mouth, who had never done anything that wasn't for his own personal brand his entire life. This man whose vanity put his name in gold letters on hotels and casinos all over the world. This man whose brutish and debased character wiped away any of his competitors through shady deals and unethical business practices. An overweight, orange-haired horror whose fame grew on television, who used his success to appeal to those who still believed the American dream could work for them too, who still equated vast wealth with virtue instead of greed and corruption. This man of business rose to the highest office in the land to become President of the United States.
  It was not difficult to find an image of him to focus on. She found a photo on a news website and readied the device, placing the knitted hat on her head. She started the program and focused on his image. Briefly the thought that this could be an act of treason crossed her mind, but she had to know. If this were a real it would change the world and she had to know it was possible and to see it for herself, no matter what the cost.
  As her vision stabilized she saw into his image, much like the way it happened in her experiment on the old woman early. And suddenly she was no longer looking at his image but at the man himself. The image twisted and swirled as she went deeper and what was unclear to her was if what she was seeing was a memory or a dream or something happening in that moment. She did not feel well, the disorienting feeling seemed amplified by the distance. She wasn't even sure about what she was seeing, if it were in her own mind. 
  She was in a crowd of people, dressed how politicians in Washington D.C. dress, all black business wear, long coats, impeccable hair and makeup. Surrounded by black limousines, SUVs, police on motorcycles. It was a cold day, overcast. The streets were wet, the grass on the park where they all stood was set. They were waiting for something, for someone to arrive. And then a stretched Cadillac emerged from a nearby side street, huge and black, flags of the USA affixed to the hood. The police had cleared a spot on the street and the car pulled to a stop. The rear door opened and she had a difficult time seeing who emerged, so she fought through the crowd to get a better view. And on the ground next to the opened door there slithered the president like an obese serpent, up the curb and onto the grass, his arms tucked at his side, his long red tie stained by the dirt and the grass, his head raised and a forked tongue stuck out of his small, round mouth.
  She stood back, fearful, like many in the crowd, and then the president raised up onto his legs, towering above them all and shrank down to his normal size again. Men in trench coats approached him from both sides and wiped the grass and dirt from his shirt as he began to smile and shake hands with all in attendance, including herself.
  Then the streets and the park in Washington crumbled away, the daytime sky dropped like a curtain and suddenly it was dark, the moon in the sky on a clear night. She stood in a construction site, on a dirt road, where massive buildings surrounded her on every side, she saw the beams and girders, temporary lifts, plastic tarps nailed over the openings. She walked down the road hoping to find something. And then in a parking spot lit by a single overhead light she saw the Cadillac from the motorcade. With apprehension she approached the car, looking around to make sure no one else was around, looking at the ground since she wasn't sure what was real and what was not. And then she was inside the car, in the front seat, with a clear view of the back seat, the original version of _China Girl_ playing on the radio. And there was the president, bent over the rear console, pants around his waist, belly drooping over the console and his small hands gripping hard the sides of the leather seats, his face in pained ecstasy. The man behind him thrusted as if it were his duty to do so. And then she was no longer herself. She was him. And with his eyes she looked at the front seat and saw nobody there in the place she had been sitting only moments ago. She herself felt the spasms of pleasure from those hard thrusts and then a feeling she had not expected to feel, something feminine and yielding, deep within. She let out a groan and heard his own voice. He gripped the soft leather of the seats and placed her hand down on the floorboard and shut her eyes. A wave of intense pity nearly brought him to tears, pity for those who would never know this kind of luxury, this kind of refined excellence. He felt for the poor in this world who would never know that feeling of taking off your socks and rubbing your toes through the camelhair in these floor mats. Then there were tears, for the poor who would never know the feeling of high-quality leather on your skin, when everything you own and come into contact with on a daily basis is of the utmost quality, the best quality. He wept for them.
  They were on the road again, driving out of the construction site. They drove the back streets until they reached the interstate and got on, blue signs with white letters directing them back to Pennsylvania Avenue. They came to a stop, traffic was stopped from an accident on the highway. It was not too far ahead. From the looks of it the accident had not happened that long ago. A tractor-trailer was jackknifed in the middle of the lanes, flames emerging from underneath the trailer, billows of black smoke spewing into the air. Underneath the trailer was the wreckage of a white Lexus, also burning, crushed up to the windshield. Whoever was driving it surely dead.
  The president got out of the back seat and jogged to the site of the wreckage, his driver calling out the window for him to come back, that it wasn't safe. His trench dangled in the night air as he ran, passing by cars with surprised faces when they saw him go by. A few minutes later he arrived at the scene. The truck driver was being attended to by two people, one of whom wiped his face and neck with a wet cloth. The firetrucks and ambulances had not yet arrived. Another crowd was standing back, away from the Lexus which was on fire, looking in. When he walked up the people were surprised and didn't know how to react. He ignored them.
  "Is anyone alive in that car?"
  "Mr. President?"
  "I said is anyone in that car!"
  A man came up. His voice was shaky.
  "There is a woman, sir. We are afraid to move her. She is injured but still alive."
  "What's your name, son?"
  "David."
  "David, let me tell you something. That car is on fire. In a few minutes those flames will have reached the cabin and will have burned that poor woman alive. Do you want that to happen on your watch?"
  "No, sir."
  "Then help me get her out. We don't have time to wait for the EMTs. It'll all be over by the time they arrive."
  A group of three of them, led by the president, approached the burning car. The president removed his white scarf and using that they tied her arms across her chest, to minimize her injuries.
  "Now look. As we pull her out we need to be extra careful with her neck and spine. David, I need you to grab her legs and pull them out from behind the steering wheel. And you, sir, you I need to support her back at the torso. Do whatever you can to prevent her spine from moving. We won't disturb her from the position she's in now. We'll wait on the paramedics to do that."
  With this, he reached in and unstrapped the seat belt. She opened her eyes and saw him but did not recognize him. With the three of them they were able to get her free and carry her to a safe place. They set her down in the same position, he holding her behind the head so it would not move. The others were able to let her go and they stood up.
  There was a deep laceration on her torso, which opened when her arms opened and blood poured out onto her blouse.
  "Don't stand there, you guys! Get me something to help cover her wounds. Blankets, a jacket, anything. Now!"
  The woman became conscious and when she saw her wounds started to panic and her breathing became more rapid.
  "I'm dying. Oh God no. Oh please."
  He tried to calm her, he placed his hand on her forehead and hair. She looked up at him and did recognize him, but looked confused. At this point the flames from the Lexus had spread to the cabin and beyond, to the back seat and gas tank. There was a large explosion which frightened the woman. He only kept his hand on her forehead and held her in his arms. Some others gave him a blanket and he spread it around her to help stop the bleeding. But there was really nothing be done.
  "How about that ambulance? Are they here yet?"
  "No sir. 911 said they were on the way."
  The woman was frightened. He held her but felt that her skin was cold, pale. Her breaths were shallow. Again she looked up at him. Her mouth trembled. He leaned closer to hear.
  "I'm sorry for all the things I did."
  She repeated this several more times, her voice becoming fainter, and each time he responded by whispering into her ear.
  "You are loved."
  She removed the device and set it down on the table and dried her her eyes. Then she went downstairs and out the side door to smoke and she gazed up at the stars. Out here, away from the lights of the town, you could often see the Milky Way. She saw it tonight, those million specks of light, swirling together. Her thoughts went back to what she had just experienced, the things she had seen, no felt. Her heart was his and his heart was hers and it was that moment she knew the potential this device had was real. It would change the world. She tried to imagine the world it would create.
  People would have the ability to fully understand, for maybe the first time in history, their neighbor. And not only to understand, but to know their neighbor as well as they know themselves. In such a world how can one take advantage of another? It doesn't seem possible. And if one is in want and another has that which the other person needs, then it goes without saying that the person who has will give it to the one who needs. In this way economies throughout the world would stabilize, wealthy nations would give their surplus resources to poorer nations until an equilibrium has been established. From this point onward all governments would then unite, how could it be otherwise? If every man and woman on Earth becomes as fully known to you as your own brother or sister, and you feel the responsibility that one has towards a member of your own family, then how else could it be? Then working together, every human being on this planet, towards the common good of each one, what sort of world would that create?
  She let her mind go further. She saw the troubles which plague our civilization vanish overnight, problems of the poor, problems of the distribution of resources utterly gone. Issues of social justice like racism, sexism, gender bias, religious discrimination would disappear. It seemed too good to be true. So then she tried to poke holes in this line of reasoning. There would be those who resist, who would not trust the technology, either from fear or religious beliefs, or just a simple independent spirit. There would be those who benefitted from the current system who like things as they are, thank you very much, and they would choose not to participate. There might even be propaganda distributed saying that this new way was harmful and destructive to our values. The thing to do here would not be to force them to join in. Let people live as they want. Freedom should not be taken away. As the old way of life crumbles into a relic of the past they will eventually see that this new way is for the benefit of all. The important thing would be to allow people to join in their own time. To not use the technology to become fascists.
  She let her mind go to other, more specific things. Banded together with all the worlds resources behind it, the scientific community would make tremendous progress in eradicating diseases and in discovering new medicines and technologies to ease the suffering of those whose diseases were not curable. With no more  contradicting data from the companies who profit from polluting technologies such as oil, we would do what we can to clean up the environment, develop better, non-polluting sources of renewable energy. At the same time we would begin to put serious resources behind space exploration, not driven by the fear of an enemy country establishing weaponry in orbit, nor to just look for more resources, but instead driven out of a genuine curiosity of what lies beyond the boundaries of our understanding.
  What sort of people would they be? she wondered. Would they be hive-mind drones, with no individual sense of self, would personality reach of a point of equilibrium just like with resources once everyone shared a common mind. But it wasn't a common mind, really. That was a mistaken notion. This was not about suppressing the individual. It was about empathy, an ability to understand another, and recognize they are a part of you. Empathy doesn't work unless there are boundaries of self. People would be free for the first time in history to truly be themselves, to follow the impulse of their hearts, without a need to struggle for survival of their basic needs. Food, medicine, clothing, shelter, these will become basic human rights, which everyone agrees to and contributes towards.
  She saw people moving off of Earth, in small groups at first. Colonizing the moon, then Mars, the moons of Jupiter. Harvesting materials to build permanent space stations, more than stations, but habitable arks. All those strange futures she had read about in science fiction novels and film, they could be true.
  Again the setting fell away, the space arks, Jupiter and its moons, space itself melted as if made of wax and another swirl of imagery took its place. She was in the office with a man, a placard that read Richard Dewey, Director was on the desk. She was explaining the technology to him. He was watching her intently, with skepticism. When she was finished there was a moment of silence that went on for almost a minute. Richard sat in his chair again, looking at the desk, not making eye contact. She too looked down.
  "I assume you have documentation of your research so far. Also I asked you to bring your computer, where is that? All of it will need to be handed over, along with your security badge, so we can verify the things you have told me so far, and figure out how best to move forward. I'm sorry it has to be this way, Zoey, but you had to know we'd find out sooner or later. I mean, this is huge. More than huge. Now hand over the computer, and your badge."
  "I won't give you my computer. It's in a safe place, along with every piece of documentation and software that I've ever written for project Aura. The device too. All of it stays in my possession until I know what the Andromeda Group plans to do with it."
  "Zoey, please listen to reason here. This is not about the Andromeda Group. This is bigger than that. This is a matter of national security. Don't you get that? If the things you told me are true, if this technology got in the hands of terrorists, enemy states, we'd have no defense. We need to tread very carefully here and follow protocol. Now I've spoken to Stephen Blankenship at headquarters,"
  "Richard, haven't you heard a single word I've said? I planned to come to you, to you specifically, because you're the only person I feel like I can trust, but only after I proved a two-way communication channel could be achieved, effectively preventing a one-way communication channel. This technology is too dangerous as it is now. It's too invasive. Especially in the hands of a large corporation or God forbid the US government."
  "And you know this how?"
  "As I said, I've tested it. I offered to show you."
  "And you will show me, and anyone else, but I need to know everything Zoey, right now. How else am I'm going to represent your interests here, if you don't come clean with me."
  "I can represent my own interest, thanks though."
  "You still don't get it. You used our equipment, our lab, to develop this technology in a clandestine manner, without authorization. You don't own this so-called project Aura. The Andromeda Group does. Your employment contract stipulates as much. Now tell me how exactly you know this technology can be used invasively."
  She sat in her chair, shifting, her eyes looking at the pen cup on his desk, at the plant in the corner, anywhere but at her friend and boss.
  "Zoey, did you use it on me?"
  She looked up and met his eyes, confirming his fear. A look of concern grew on his face.
  "Who else?"
  "An old woman, Janice something, who I hired at the truck stop near 75. I tested it on her."
  "Without her knowledge?"
  "Yes."
  He wrote some notes on a pad near his hand.
  "Who else?"
  "That's it."
  "Zoey."
  "Richard."
  "This is serious. I don't know how the hell the the law will interpret something like this, but it can't be good. You need to come clean. Who else?"
  She was silent and then very plainly said,
  "The president."
  "The president of Andromeda Group?"
  "No."
  "Then which president?" He said, his eyes growing wider. She looked up and met his gaze, confirming his suspicion. He leaned back in the chair, and rubbed his eyes with both hands. He seemed unprepared for the things he was hearing.
  "Zoey. This is treasonous."
  "Don't you get it? Don't you get why I can't hand this technology over just like that. If any entity of power gets hold of this technology they will be unstoppable. They're reach and influence will have no limits. None. And that cannot happen."
  He gave her a look of pure rage.
  "Just who the hell do you think you are? To make that kind of decision. It's not your call to make."
  "I discovered it."
  "But you don't own it!"
  "Neither does Andromeda Group. This is not about who owns what. The technology is not the discovery. The technology is only a way to it."
  "What are you talking about?"
  "The technology, meaning the algorithm and the device, are only amplifiers of a pattern of energy that for all we know has always been there, just dormant. If the Aura stream is fire then the technology is a fan blowing over an ember, at best. Do you see what I mean? It's like what Jonas Salk said when they asked him why didn't he patent the polio vaccine. Would you patent the sun?"
  "Jesus Christ, Zoey. Don't quote Jonas Salk to me like we're still undergrads at Tech."
  "What happened to you?"
  He seemed confused by the question.
  "Nothing happened to me. Life happened. I grew up that's all."
  "Remember when we were undergrads? Those late nights we'd grab pizza and go to the top of A building and stargaze, with the other nerds. Talking shit. Quoting Jonas Salk and all the great things we were going to do in our lives. We used to talk about devoting ourselves to science that would change the world, that would change things for the better, and especially for the less fortunate."
  "Kids talk that way. I was a kid. Dedicating yourself to that kind of altruism hardly pays the bills. And I got bills. I got responsibilities. See these two here?"
  He showed her a photo on his desk of his two children, a boy and girl, taken at a playground.
  "I do the work I do now to make enough money to support them. Kids ain't cheap. But you don't know about that, do you? And the work I do here at Andromeda Group is honorable work. It's interesting work, pushing the envelope of what we can achieve with technology. I resent your insinuation that we aren't doing that here."
  "But its the reason behind the work, its to enrich these companies. Do you think they would invest the money here to help others. No, its ultimately to maintain their position as market leaders, to continue to line the pockets of shareholders."
  "What's wrong with that? There's nothing wrong with that? Stop looking at the world in such a black and white terms. I swear, sometimes its like you reached college age - that age where everything is fuck the man and everything is hypocrisy, that you failed to grow up beyond that. You know what happens when you dedicate your work to altruism like you say? You go broke, move into your parents basement, complaining on message boards about how the man got you down. The real truth is that life is about survival and money represents value in this world. To maximize the reach of your impact you have to be practical, you have to make sure that the things you work on, that you dedicate yourself to, make money. Get real, Zoey. It's time for you to grow up."
  "You may be right. I probably do have a lot of growing up to do. But whenever I am in this place and see that everyone limits their ideas only to those ideas which have an assured monetary value, I feel like I'm in a box. By being so practical we've shut ourselves in a box. For so long now that we don't even dream of anything outside the box. Or we do dream but even those dreams are bounded within the box. Nice, safe dreams, where everyone lives in a house and has a car and goes on vacations to Florida every summer. And I think back to when I was truly free to wonder and follow every crazy idea that came into my head. Not because it might earn me a living but because I was curious. And I can't help thinking that something has been lost. And I want to get it back. I want to explore those ideas, even dangerous ones. Ideas that could change the world forever."
  "You mean destroy the world. Because an idea like project Aura could do that, you know. Once a technology like this is unleashed to human beings, none of our institutions would stand."
  "Maybe its time for that to happen. There's a reason I discovered the Aura when I did. I'm not special. Maybe this is like Darwin discovering evolution at the same time other scientists were also discovering it. Maybe its just time for this world to be destroyed. And if not by project Aura, then maybe someone else is on the verge of discovering the same kind of technology, or already has."
  "Do you hear what you're saying? I don't want the world to be destroyed. Its not perfect, but this is the world we live in. We have an obligation to make it better."
  "I'm not disagreeing with that. When I say destroy what I mean is evolve. Change is inevitable. Maybe we're finally moving past the stage where people and states acted independently. And all those systems which profit from things the way they are, maybe its time for them to go away."
  "You mean the economy? Government? Law enforcement? Infrastructure? I want my kids to know they have a future. Not this hypothetical world where everybody does what's right because they see the other guy's point of view, or whatever this new age horseshit you're babbling about. The world is not such a bad place. I mean its given you a job, the time to work on this side project."
  "The world isn't a bad place for us. We're educated men and women living in the most prosperous country in the world. But for most people the world is rotten. And it needs to change. And this could be that change. But to hand this technology to corporations or our government when its potential has not even been realized would be a huge mistake."
  "Why are you so angry at the world? What did it ever do to you? What did it ever take from you, to cause you to want its destruction so bad? I mean on a personal level. I don't want to hear any more philosophizing."
  "For one, it took away my friends. I watched the world take them away from me, one by one. And it broke my heart to see it happen. Look at what happened to you. There was a time when we were so close, man. There was a time when we talked about important things, God, the universe, society, art, truth. Now everything is money and business. Business and money. We used to talk about the things that really matter in life. And it was good while it lasted. I thought it would always be that. I took it for granted. That was how life should be, the way we were then, creative and pointless and free. Because its in those times of pointless creativity that our minds are free to go places where logic and rationality can never get to, because its dangerous, because its unexplored."
  "Money has given me freedom, Zoey. Money provides you with that freedom that you claim to value so much. With money you aren't beholden to an employer. You aren't beholden to anyone. You can say fuck you at any time and walk away. And what about having the ability to help others with my money? I paid off my parents house last year. Could I have done that without money? I was able to give them freedom. Do you think the research in this facility, not to mention the research you've done, could have happened without capital from the Andromeda Group? Money and business are what allows to dream big and to make those dreams real. That's just the way it is. I pity you because you stopped growing up, before you could realize that finding the balance between dreams and practicality is the greatest wisdom in life. I also still have dreams you know. Just because you have money doesn't mean you can't have dreams. I want to be a better person than I was yesterday. I want to make things that will someday change the world for the better. But everything happens in its proper place and time. And sometimes practical concerns in life take precedence. And that's okay."
  "Betraying your dreams doesn't happen in one fell swoop, you know. It happens slowly, over many years, as more and more of your life is taken up by those practical concerns, until one day you turn around and you're trapped inside the box, and then it starts to close in around you, constricting not only your ability to dream, but also what you are able to dream. That goes for companies like the Andromeda Group. You say money gives you freedom, but what about the freedom to give up money? Are you free do that? Or does more money tighten its grip you even more and enslave you to it, to do whatever it commands you to do. To serve it."
  "Enough Zoey, I can't listen to this nonsense anymore. You know what? Get real. You sound like you're reading a goddamn poem and it makes me want to throw up. Join me back on planet Earth, why don't you? All this woo-woo talk doesn't change the fact that we live in the real world and its not going anywhere anytime soon. It doesn't change the fact that you are in violation of your employment contract. And that the Andromeda Group owns the technology you developed. And as far as one-way channel, two-way channel, too bad. You will hand over your research, your computer, the device, and anything else and the Andromeda Group will decide what's useful and what isn't. Do you understand?"
  The door to the office opened and two men entered, dressed in dark suits. Richard stood up, nodded to them, as if he had been expecting them all along. She stood up, facing the two men and headed towards the door. The two men approached her and each one gripped her arms. She struggled and kicked one of them in the shin. They were too strong. They sat her down in the chair again. Richard tried not to watch. Eventually he spoke again, unable to look her in the eye.
  "We need the computer. We need the device. And we need you to show us your research and how to use the algorithm."
  "Who do these guys work for? Who are they?"
  He would not answer her questions.
  "Why are they here?"
  Again the office in front of his eyes disintegrated into a million pieces and he found himself alone in a room, in a house. There was a window with sunlight shining through the linen curtains. This was a bedroom. The bed was made, with white pillows and a pink blanket. On the bed were dolls. On the floor next to the bed was a heater, its red coils radiating warmth. On the wall were posters of rock stars and drawings of unicorns and rainbows. He looked at himself in the vanity mirror at the other end of the room, next to a standing closet. His image was distorted and detracted, as if looking at someone underwater. On the vanity he saw a notebook computer with wires connected to it, attached to a wired headset he did not recognize. The notebook seemed to him incongruous with the rest of the room, which looked like a young girl's room. The door to the room was closed. He went to it and turned the knob slowly, unsure what he would find on the other side. A living room. Nothing unusual. A small 19 inch television on a wooden cabinet, a couch with tears in the cushions. To the right was an open area that led to the kitchen. On the kitchen table there were pizza boxes, wrapping paper, scissors. It looked as if someone had been here recently though there was no indication of anyone in the house now.
  "Zoey?"
  He walked to another door, towards the back of the living room. He opened the door and saw a queen sized bed, nearly filling the space. The bed was unkempt, there were clothes on the floor. Another floor heater, not turned on. On the walls in this room were store-bought paintings of meadows and mountains, covering the exposed concrete brick. He returned to the living and called out her name again. No answer. If she had been here she wasn't now. He felt strange, as if he remembered this place from many years ago, with the same butterflies in the pit of the stomach feeling which accompanies revisiting such a place. And then he heard people outside. A lot of people from the sound of it, having conversations, laughing. And then a woman burst in through the door in the kitchen, a gust of the cold breeze and a few dried leaves followed her in. She was a black woman, young, singing to herself. When she saw him standing in the living room  she was not surprised, she merely smiled and nodded to him. Then  went to the refrigerator and pulled out a layer cake with strawberry frosting, a single candle in the shape of the number eight on top. She set the cake on the table and covered the top with rainbow-colored sprinkles from a small bottle. She went to the door but it had closed. He saw she would have difficulty opening the door with her hands full, so he ran over to open it for her. She said thanks and went outside.
  He followed her around the side of the house to the front yard. It was a birthday party. The birthday girl was wearing a white dress and was running around with her friends, playing a game of tag. The guests were the parents of the children, standing around with cups of fruit punch, eating pepperoni pizza on paper plates. The theme of the party was Duck Dodgers in the 24th Century and all the plates and cups were decorated with imagery from the cartoon, Duck Dodgers himself, Marvin the Martian, rocket ships, space stations, planets. Everything except the cake, which was just pink strawberry, a request from the birthday girl.
  "Zoey, come on baby. We need to sing happy birthday so you can open your presents."
  Her mother lit the candle as Zoey and the other children sat down in chairs around the table. The adults gathered hovered over their children and made them calm down to get ready to sing. One of the parents handed him the Polaroid camera and asked if he would take a photo, she was distracted by having to clean her son's shirt, which had fruit punch all over it. He took the camera and stood back away from the table. Her father came over and together with her mother they began to sing Happy Birthday, with everyone else joining in. She looked around as they sang, very happy and proud. Then when the song was over she took a deep breath and at the same moment he readied the camera and took a photo right as she blew the candle out.
  Everyone clapped. The white film rolled out of the front of the camera and he took it and held it delicately to not smudge the print. Slowly the image faded from white to beige and then you could start to recognize the shapes in the photo and then more color filled in the shapes, pale at first, then darker and darker. He walked over to her parents, who were getting out plates and plastic forks for the cake and ice cream, and handed them the photo. Her mother took the photo and set it on the porch to fully develop. Zoey glanced up at him from her seat in front of the cake and smiled a snaggle-toothed grin. Before her mother took the knife to the cake, she pulled out the candle and only then did he see written on top with blue frosting the words, "Help Me".
  
12

  He was sitting on the bed in the hotel room, in the late afternoon, the device in his hands, the computer screen in front of him lighting up his face. He stared at the photograph of the birthday party, her about to blow out the candles, and even now he could feel the excitement of that moment, he felt her anticipation as if it were his own. He went to the sink and washed his face. A little of the nauseous feeling remained so he lay on the bed until it went away. All the things he had seen and heard and felt during their communion went through his mind. But one thing that he kept returning was the computer in the house, the old house where the birthday party happened, in the small bedroom. It was out of place in a conspicuous way. Remembering a detail from the Aura notes, he turned the computer screen towards him. He found the notes again and scanned them until he found the passage he was looking for.

	She told me about her family, how her daddy had left when she was only five years old. Turns out she grew up in house in Shannon village. Not that far from the house I grew up in. Life is funny man.

  Looking at the photograph again, this time focusing on the background details, he noted the number of the house. 1293. The only other detail of significance was a powder blue water tower above the tree line in the distance across the street. Too far away to make out the writing on it. But maybe that was enough.
  In the Maps application he turned on GPS satellite data and zoomed in over Shannon, a part of town north of downtown. Eventually he did find an old water tower but it was painted green. He couldn't find another. He made a guess at how far away you'd be able to see the tower and marked a radius. He clicked around the neighborhoods to find a house number like the one on the house but could find nothing. There was still enough daylight to drive up there and see what he could discover himself. On a pad near the telephone he jotted down the street names where he needed to drive. He packed up the computer and device into the backpack and headed out the door.
  Headed north he kept a paranoid eye on the rearview mirror. He passed the jailhouse and the Dodge dealership and drove five miles to Shannon. When he turned into the main road through the village, 1st street, he looked out for the road that would take him to the water tower. Ten minutes later he was there, the pine green water tower surrounded by a rusted chain link fence. 
  He took a side road near the water tower and drove to the cross street that marked the outer edge of the radius. From there he drove down the streets, looking for anything like the house in the photograph or in the communion. This was a poor neighborhood with its best days clearly behind. The cotton mill which supported the community had shuttered ten years ago. He knew that because it had been one of the few good places to work. He passed a group of kids playing ball in the street. They glared at him as he went by and continued to stare after he had passed.
  As he drove he looked over the trees to see what the tower looked like. Most of the time he couldn't see it at all, which made him doubt his radius. But as he turned into streets closer to the tower he began to see it. Only the top at first but then more and more of it. And eventually it looked a lot like in the photograph and he knew he was in the right place, if it even was the same water tower.
  It was late and the sky was orange and the clouds in the sky were blue and gray. He was not sure he would even be able to see the house by now. He turned down the next road, barely making out the sign before he turned. It was a narrow street, nearly one lane. But it was open, the trees were less dense, and so there was more light to see by. And then he spotted a house on a small hill. The yard was overgrown and the house itself was in disrepair, but despite that he recognized it as the same one, at least from a distance. He pulled into the gravel road next to the hill and stopped the car. He got out and found the water tower in roughly the same place it was in the photo.
  He approached the house with caution, deciding to walk around the back first. The windows of the house were either boarded or covered with plastic. On the front porch was a sign that read _No Trespassing_. The surface of the house was molded and covered with lichen. Black, damp leaves on the ground surrounded the place. He spotted the side door which he had held open for her mother during the birthday party. There was a board over the door, nailing it shut. Out the back window was a thick cord which ran into the ground. He pulled it up and followed its direction and figured it went to the nearest power line by the road. He went to the window and peered inside. He saw broken furniture and dishes on the floor. Nothing else.
  Once he had walked around the entire house he tried to find the best way in. Of course the front door was locked. He knocked on it just to see if he could hear anyone inside. But there was no answer and no stirring inside. By now it was dusk. He found a window where the plastic was torn and was able to fit himself through and entered into the living room.
  "Zoey?"
  It was silent.
  The door to the her bedroom was closed. From the crack at the bottom of the door he could see light inside. He went to the door and knocked. No answer. He pushed open the door and entered. There was nobody here. A notebook computer was on top of a milk crate. Next to the computer were wires and another makeshift device, but without being affixed underneath a knitted hat. On the floor was a small camping air mattress and a blanket, a small pillow. Next to the window was a small element heater. It glowed a bright orange color and radiated an intense heat he could feel from where he stood. The black cord he had seen from outside came from this room, no doubt how she was getting power for her computer and heater.
  He called through the house, wanting to be sure he was alone. The last thing he wanted to do was frighten her. He checked the remaining spaces, the whole place was fallen apart, boxes and leaves on the floor. Cold and empty. He returned to the bedroom.  On the computer he found evidence that this was the computer used to message him. He wondered if maybe she had gone somewhere.
  In the living room he found a particle board entertainment center lying on its side and used that as a chair. In his pocket he found the burner phone he had used to contact the ones following him. He had never responded to their texts about the meeting. There were eleven unread messages and he went through them all.

  The last he received while reading the others. The screen lit up and vibrated, making his heart jump. He had to get rid of this phone soon. But not here. He thought to send a message to give him more time but erased it at the last minute and stuck the phone back in his pocket. It was very cold in the living room. Now that it was dark outside the temperature had dropped below freezing. He breathed visible air and put his hands in his pocket. Then outside he heard a vehicle pull into the driveway and saw light coming through the tarp. A door slamming and moments later footsteps on the gravel.
  He went to the front window and peered through the cracks in the boards. The only light on the street was down a ways and it cast amber onto the overgrown grass but nowhere else, not on the driveway itself. And then he heard leaves crunching in the yard. If it was her where would she enter. The side door was boarded up. The front door was the only one that still looked functional. But whoever it was had not come up the porch. He turned facing the living room so he could hear better any sounds from outside but now there were no sounds.
  The last thing he wanted to do was scare her. He decided to stand there and wait, hands up, plainly visible, to show that he meant her no harm. Soon he heard fidgeting at the back of the house, the rattling sound of metal on metal, metal on wood. Then a beam from a flashlight fell over the kitchen walls, wavering unsteadily, from somewhere behind the cupboard, a hidden entrance maybe. He heard a person shuffle out and cleared his throat very calmly. The flashlight beam instantly moved to where he stood in the middle of the living room.
  "Zoey."
  He addressed her calmly.
  "You asked me for help."
  He continued since there had been no answer from her. The light shone brightly onto his face. It did not move from there, nor did the person move or make any sound.
  "So I found you."
  Then the flashlight clicked off and the next thing he knew something very hard and very heavy hitting his side. He fell to the floor, the wind knocked out of him. And in the next moment someone was on him. Heavy. Big. Not a woman. He felt an intense pain in his jaw and then on the side of his head. He saw stars and heard muffled growls of anger. And then more hits came. He clenched his legs around the torso of the person on top of him and used all his leverage to heave them off. He stumbled backwards onto his feet and smacked into the wall. He was disoriented but knew the general direction of the attacker.
  "Hold up a damn minute! Who are you? I'm looking for Zoey Jackson. Does she live here?"
  He heard the person shuffling back into the kitchen. On hands and knees from the sound of it.
  "Turn on a Goddamn light in here so you can see I don't mean you no trouble. My hands are raised. You don't have to worry about me."
  In the next moment he heard the same growling, a wet gargle, as if from a rabid animal or something with a diseased mind. And then a tortured scream and the sound of something in the darkness rushing towards him. He dove behind the entertainment center and heard the other collide with the wall. On the floor he found a sharpened sliver from a glass pane and brandished it like a knife.
  "I don't want to hurt you but you're not leaving me any choice."
  He took off in the direction of the kitchen. The other must have heard him because in a moment he felt two arms clutch him around the waist and tackle him to the floor. In response he sliced in that direction with all his strength and felt the blade hook into flesh. Then there was a howling in his ear, the voice inhuman. And not long after that he felt teeth sinking into his neck. He twisted and lurched his body to break free but the other was too heavy, and stronger than him.
  The pain from his wound grew in intensity and he felt his own rage growing and lashed out with punches and scratches. He cursed him and felt murder inside him. Their weight of their struggle broke the entertainment center and bashed into the walls and corners. Each attempting to get the upper hand in the struggle. As his eyes became more accustomed to the darkness he tried to see who this person was but could make out no detail. At some point they stood and he rushed the man and pushed him against the door into the bedroom with the computer. As they collapsed into the room their feet got caught on the wires and pulled the device and notebook to the floor where the screen cracked into a abstract rainbow of digital light. He grabbed one of those black wires and jerked it from the machine and attempted to wind it around his neck. The other grabbed ahold and pulled it away, punching him in the kidney with his free hand. The jolt caused him to let the wire go and the other man grabbed it and did the same to his neck, yanking it taut.
  As he felt the wire tighten around his neck his vision grew dim and then when he breathed out nothing came and when he breathed in also nothing came and then he panicked. He kicked both feet to try to get free and saw stars appearing at the corner of his eyes. And then the murder he had felt growing inside him exploded into rage and he found the strength to pry the wire loose. He bit down hard on those fingers and felt his incisors hit the bone. A yowl from the other man and he was free, the blood of his adversary on his tongue. As the other stumbled backwards he toppled the element heater onto the mattress. Moments later black smoke started to fill the room. But now that the rage had come he was not concerned with any instincts of self-preservation. He pinned the man against the wall and feeling weakness in him only increased his fury. He heard himself let out an enraged scream, like the scream from a wounded hyena, and he was simultaneously aware of it and the one doing it and then all went dark as pitch and he remembered nothing else after.
  Before he opened his eyes he could feel the heat from the flames in the room and see the orange light from behind his eyelids. And he came around and opened his eyes and the mattress fire had spread up the wall and ceiling. His hair was singed from his head and his skin was boiling from the radiant heat in the room. He smelled meat and saw beside him the horror that remained of the other man. He saw the pool of blood and innards spilled onto the floor, sizzling on the tiles, and the face of the man now unrecognizable, shredded, chewed. He saw blood on his arms and tasted blood and hair and even flesh on his tongue. He stumbled to his feet and left the room, spitting and crying.
  The house was engulfed in flames and the heat from it was unbearable. He dodged his way past fire and cinder falling from the ceiling and went to the kitchen and with a single kick broke through the wooden barricade and found himself outside on the ground, rolling in the cold leaves, trying to get away from the heat but unable to since it was himself who was burning. He lay on the ground, past the point of pain because his burns were so great. He was unable to turn to watch the house burn but could see the light reflected on the branches of the Maple tree overhead. Beyond the tree he saw the driveway and in the driveway he saw the Red Tacoma with a smashed tailgate.
  Drifting in and out of consciousness he heard a distance sound of sirens. He forced himself to his feet and hobbled into the woods nearby and hid in the brush and watched the firetruck arrive and douse the flames until it was all wet ash and scorched brick, smoke rising from the embers. Ambulance and police arrived but there was nothing for them to do. None of them approached the woods where he observed. His mind was delirious and he wondered if he had also brain damage his thoughts were so hazy and unclear. The only thing he knew for sure was that it would be bad to be discovered here. Now that he was safe he lay back among the dead leaves and fallen branches lost consciousness. Already the burns on his body were beginning to ache in the frigid air and he knew it would only get worse from here on out. He didn't sleep but drifted between waking and sleeping for the next few hours, until he was awoken by a vibrating in his jacket pocket. With great difficulty he was able to remove the burner phone and unlock it. He studied the words on the screen for a long time, not taking it in, not understanding, but really not concerned either, _Now come back_. It was as sensible as anything else really but the words remained in his dreaming mind until dawn, the letters of the text spiraling out of themselves to create original letters which were really the same ones as before.

  Frost covered the pile of limbs and leaves that had been his shelter the night before. The sky above was morning gray, low clouds going by, a cold front which had moved in the night before. He lay curled in a position where the pain from his burns was bearable enough to lose consciousness for awhile. It could not have been considered sleep because there was no rest. He awoke from the pain of his burns. His blistered hands reached to his face and felt unfamiliar welts and a rough texture where his hair used to be. A few minutes after that he began to feel the sting of the cold all over his body, especially in his fingers. It took some time before he was able to get to his feet, the pain from moving his limbs was almost too much to bear. He peeled leaves from the raw areas which were the skin had peeled. He zipped up the jacket which was also burned in places and began to walk.
  In this direction the woods were parallel to the main road. Nearby he could hear morning traffic but he was too far away to see it, or to be seen, which was really the point. He trudged over the limbs and twigs and leaves which made up the bed of the winter forest, creating a lot of racket. But he was not troubled. He was not hiding or running, not anymore. He was going back.
  Later in the day the clouds opened up and bright rays of sunlight broke through. The rays came down onto him, warming the wounds and made the agony of the pain worse for him. So he kept to the dark part of the woods, where there was a canopy of tree limbs entwined together. Sometimes there was no path but through the light and he had to wait for the clouds to darken the way again. Like this he walked all afternoon until the sun was low enough so that it no longer entered the woods and he could walk without fear of it. Four miles he covered this first day.
  It was dusk and he no longer had the energy to walk. He found a spot in a ditch that had been dug to some purpose a long time ago, exposing the red dirt which lay underneath the colorless trees. He gathered leaves and covered himself with them in the ditch and rested his head on a pillow of loosened dirt and leaves he had crafted. He was very tired. The pain and walking and lack of any food or anything to drink had drained him. For that reason the makeshift bed really was a comfortable place, warm enough, and aside from the constant aching from his wounds he went to sleep at last.
  He was awoken in the middle of the night by something hot on the skin of his head. At first he wondered if it was just a dream but as his consciousness lifted he also heard breathing and then something wet and then a painful bite. He jerked up and heard growling very close to him. By moonlight he saw it, watching him, encircling the ditch where he slept with interest.
  "Go on!"
  But it didn't move.
  "Get!"
  For what seemed like several minutes the beast watched him from a safe distance. At times it appeared it was losing interest, sniffing the ground instead, and the tightness in his chest relaxed, but then its would head tilt back in his direction and became interested in something else about him. At last he lost patience and started growling at it, raising his arms above his head like a grizzly bear. In answer to that, the animal knelt low to the ground, ears back against its head, and growled, teeth bared, and then a short bark. And it leapt.
  By instinct he locked both arms in front of him and when its collided with him his hands wrapped around its throat, anything to keep those jaws away from his neck where he knew it would go, also by instinct. He no longer felt the stings from his burns as he struggled in the dark. Its legs found a solid place on the ground and pushed against him until his back gave way and he fell onto his back in a much more vulnerable position. Moments would come when somethings savage in the animal would break free and he could no longer hold it back, the strength and rage too much. Unlike his struggle in the house he himself felt no anger towards the beast. Just fear that it would not stop until he was dead and that he didn't have the strength to fight it off forever. So his own instincts of self-preservation awoke and he dropped one of his arms to the ground beside him, feeling on the ground for something, anything to give himself an advantage in the fight. Somehow he got to his feet and backed into the brush nearby. He felt on the ground and found a stone half-buried and without any hesitation he turned sideways and grasped the stone with both hands and heaved it out and over his head, bringing it down with all his strength onto its head. Limp, it fell to the ground and did not move. For a few minutes he stood in the same spot and caught his breath, and then once the adrenaline began to leave him he felt the burning pain start again. And now with that the bite wounds from the animal. He bled in places on his hands and arms and did his best to apply pressure to them, but it only made things worse.
  From the position of the moon in the sky he figured it must be only a couple hours until dawn. If he started again now he would have time to cross the road and enter the woods on the other side, which was the same side of the road as his destination. With trouble he started walking again, the aches from his wounds, now crusting over, hurt him the most at his joints. But he knew if he could at least get to the other side of the road it would be better. People could not see him like this. They would call the police and then he could not get there.
  He went south where the woods became sparse and he could see the road. He emerged from the woods into the clearing and felt immediately vulnerable. Anyone could see him here even though there was not much light from the street lamps. He made sure no cars were coming and started across, limping from the pain, breathing heavily. Up the road a car turned in his direction and sped that way. The car approached before he could get out of the way and only stopped at the last minute, screeching the tires. The woman inside the car was angry, banging on her steering wheel, until she saw his face and arms and then her eyes widened and became fearful. He looked at her but kept limping his way across the road. As soon as he passed the car it sped away, its tail lights casting him in a red glow.
  Now across he re-entered the woods and kept walking, eastward. These woods were less dense and so easier to traverse. It was far to the place he was going so he kept his head down and trudged through his pain and fatigue and increasing delirium. At moments he would forget where he was going and even where he was but it would always come back very strong, almost a voice, reminding him. And then at last the woods ended and he saw a tall chain link fence, maybe ten feet high, and beyond it a vast parking lot, weeds coming up through the dried pavement, and beyond it the ruins of the General Electric plant, a place that had been closed for nearly a quarter of a century. Its massive structure a combination of red brick and aluminum, now faded, and horizontal bands of windows, broken in places, also translucent with age.
  He considered his options for some time but realized at last he was going to have to climb the fence. He took some breaths and grabbed onto the links and pulled himself up. His wounds split underneath his shirt and he could feel the blood running up his arm. He ignored the pain and climbed as fast as he could. At the top he flung his leg over but it caught on the pipe and he lost his balance but re-caught it and the second time it went over. He rested for a moment while straddling the fence and caught his breath, then climbed down into the parking lot. The moon was low in the sky and the sky itself, gray with wisps of pink clouds and an orange haze on the horizon.
  Now to cross the parking lot. He shuffled as well as he could in a direction that led him around to the back of the main building. At the speed he went it took several minutes to reach the concrete docks and inclines where tractor-trailers used to back in to pick up deliveries. This particular plant had made transistors and transformers, used in the technology of a former  era. There was a time he remembered, as a child, his father had taken him on a tour here. Inside was massive. It seemed to go on for miles and miles. People wearing jumpsuits at the machinery. They had all been kind to him. They each wore yellow hard hats and at the very end the guide handed him a red sucker with white letters G.E. printed on it. That was a long time ago.
  Past the docks he came to brick buildings of different sizes, all connected, some a single story, some two, and one the tallest building at the plant, with a large concrete stack rising out of it. More broken windows, large entrances barricaded with plywood and wooden beams. There was some graffiti, beer bottles and cigarette butts on the ground, in the corners. A charred spot which had clearly been used as a place to build a fire. Grass was growing through the broken asphalt, some of it very long. He saw remnants of a bird nest in an iron light pole with a busted glass housing. And right in the middle of one of the buildings he saw a door.
  It was solid metal that had once been painted red but now was a pinkish shade of off-white. Rust had come through in places and there was a sign on the door, also faded nearly white, which read KEEP OUT. But the most interesting thing on the door, and the thing that caught his eye, because he had passed several doors before this one that had not, was that spray painted in black was a letter X nearly the size of the entire surface. And a circle was painted around it, about ten inches from the cross of the X. Something about this glyph meant something to him though he could not say what. He walked closer to the door and turned the knob but he knew it would be locked before he even turned, and it was. But there was also a keypad combination lock on a latch that was newer than the door itself. It was metal which had not yet rusted. All the numbers were turned to six and there were seven of them.
  He did not know the combination nor did he think he had the strength to break the lock in his condition. Instead he pounded on the door with his fist. Then he sat down, feeling very tired all of sudden. The knocking having winded him. He knew he was not well. He rested his back against the door and crossed his arms over his knees to keep warm. A wind blew through the parking lot and carried with it a few leaves and pieces of grass. Then it became hard for him to even sit up, such was his fatigue. He lay on the ground in front of the door and curled up for warmth. And there he slept.

  The room itself had no light source but in the corridor just beyond was a fixture which bathed his surroundings in a sickly,  fluorescent haze. He sat upright on the hard table that had been his bed. His face and arms and most of his body was wrapped in fresh bandages. And on the shelves in the room he saw various kinds of medical equipment and boxes of medicine and surgical supplies. There was nothing in the room to indicate to him the time of day. He couldn't tell if it was day or night or some time in between. He was not in pain anymore and he wondered how long he had been in this place. It was utterly silent. He placed his feet on the floor and exercised the joints in his arms and legs and neck. No pain moving either. He felt the bandages on his arms. His fingers were exposed and he could see the burns had mostly healed had had left behind scar tissue where the real skin used to be. The bandages covered most of his face, only exposing his eyes and a small slit for the mouth. Because of this he found it hard to breathe. And now that he was conscious he started to feel itching inside the bandages. And sweating. On a metal stand nearby he found a small pair of scissors. In the corner at the back of the room was a small sink with a mirror over it. He went to the sink and using the mirror to guide him he snipped loose the top-most strap and began to unravel the head bandage.
  As it came off he watched with increasing horror at what was underneath. No more did hair grow on his head. It was now polished like an egg from some strange alien being, pockmarked and mottled in shades of pink and brown. He quickly unwrapped the remaining and saw that his entire face looked this way. No more eye brows or facial hair. His nose was disfigured. The only part of his old self he recognized at all was the eyes. Those were the same. They welled with tears at what he had become and inside he felt his old life slipping away from him in a way that seemed permanent and without any hope. He saw Joseph and Suzanne and imagined with great pain how they would look at him now.
  He sat back on the table and cried into his hands as he thought about, _My life is ruined. I can't never go out in the sunlight again_. And he remembered all the times before when he was out of doors, surrounded by his neighbors in the backyard or at the grocery store, and how he had taken it for granted and how he wished he could experience that feeling one more time in his life. But he knew it would never be that way again. And the guilt he felt that it was his doing. That he had done all this to himself and how he had let the ones down who meant the most to him.
  A siren sounded from somewhere in the building. He barely heard it as a siren at first but after focusing his attention on it he knew it must be that. And once he was out of his own head he became curious about his surroundings and began to wonder where he was and how long he had been there and most importantly what he was doing there. He knew none of these things. Vaguely he could remember the struggle at the house, the fire, the escape into the woods. But nothing past that, except walking.
  Not long after that the siren ceased and it was quiet again. He found his shoes in a closet and put them on. Then he went into the corridor and followed it in the only direction he could go, being that his room was at the end of a hallway. There were other doors in the corridor but they were locked. It was very dark and smelled of must and mold. The air was damp and heavy and he found it difficult to breathe in. The corridor had a few turns to the left and right and finally opened into a large space, which to him looked like an old factory floor, empty now. The ceiling was caved in the center and support beams and insulation and wiring hung down. And stacked at the other end of the area were boxes. Hundreds of small cardboard boxes with a symbol he recognized, an X with a circle through the middle of it. But still there was nobody here. No activity of any kind that he could discern. There were windows high up on the walls, painted over but he could see a dim blue light, like when you put your hand in front of a fire and your hand lets a little of the light through. So it was daylight.
  He approached the stacks of boxes and picked one of them up. It was heavy but made no sound when he shook the box. As he was about to open one of them he heard something far off. It was not the siren this time. It was lower in tone. A generator maybe. Some kind of machine. That much he could tell. And it was running. He left the box and noticed an opened gate leading into another area. It was so dark in that side of the space he had not seen it before. In the next area was a large and complicated machine but it was not the one that was running. It hung from the ceiling and almost but not quite reached the ground. It reminded him of an mechanical snake though he could not say why. Next to it was a set of stairs leading up to a platform with grating and a control box. And just like the other area this area also led to another. One thing that troubled him was the light was decreasing the further he went inside. But there seemed nowhere else for him to go.
  The sound of the machine grew louder. His footsteps echoed across the opposite wall as he splashed through standing puddles of water. He passed workbenches, desks, cabinets. It was hard not to imagine the way it used to be when there were people who worked here day in and day out, 9 to 5, talking about what they did over the weekend while sipping coffee, talking about big finale of the ball game on TV, about who got that coveted promotion and who got passed over. At the end of this area, which appeared to be used for clerical work, was a massive sliding gate. It was opened enough for a person to get through. Here the grinding mechanical sound was at its loudest, increasing to the point where he couldn't hear himself even if he had shouted. He went through the gate.
  Once inside he had to cover his ears to stop the roaring in his ears. He felt like his eardrums were about to burst from the incessant humming, droning, and grinding of the industrial systems spread before him, towering over him. On a wall he found a box filled with neon green ear plugs. Once he fit them in his ears it dulled the noise so that it at least didn't hurt. He continued to walk down the main walkway. And he saw people, lots of them. And at last he thought he could get some answers.
  The first person he saw was a woman who wore the same kind of coveralls as him. She was older, with curly hair and a cigarette smokers face. She was on a high platform, monitoring gauges. Because she was too far away he didn't attempt to make any contact with her. But the next person, a man again in the same uniform he wore, approached walking in the opposite direction. He stopped and tried to catch the man's attention but the man never looked in his direction at all, even when he waved his arms. And then he was gone.
  This happened two other times, one with a Mexican woman who also passed him and one more time with an elderly man at work on some equipment down a section off the main walkway. But with the elderly man he walked up and waved his arms right in his face, not two inches from his nose, but the old man never once acknowledged his presence. This made him angry so he reached out and grabbed the man by the shoulders and forced him to look him directly in the eyes. The worker gave no resistance to this, and stood facing him, but his eyes never would make contact, never registered that they saw another human being at all. The old man just stared blankly, like a statue, and when he was let go of he went back to his work as if nothing had happened.
  The further he walked the more spaced out the machinery became until the area opened into a central area. So vast was this space that he couldn't even see the ceiling. The lights on stands did not reach that far so anything from thirty feet or higher vanished into the shadows. The most light in this open area was on a long, wide conveyor belt. It carried some kind of product that had been formed within the bowels of the machinery in a predictable, rhythmic pattern, like a beating heart. Dozens of workers stood on either side of the conveyor. As the product moved down the line they took hold of it and performed distinct tasks. Once he came closer he watched them manipulating that gelatinous mass the color of petroleum crude, with flecks of a rare metallic substance inside. He could not tell what it was or what in the world it could be used for, but the workers plied at it with a grave seriousness of purpose.
  Once the product had made it down the conveyor line, it was packaged into those same boxes he had seen in the other area of the plant. And once a pallet of those boxes had been filled, it was wrapped with plastic and the man who completed the wrapping gave an OK signal to a tiny, lighted room overlooking the entire area, atop a rusted metal platform. The man standing in this room caught his attention at once. It seemed to him this man could be the one to tell him what was going on. He was sure of it though he could not explain why. The room was accessible only from a set of a tiered stairway, so narrow it could only accommodate a single person at a time. Immediately he began the ascent, holding onto the rails. When he reached the building he knocked on the door. No answer came from inside, nobody came to greet him. He turned the knob and found it unlocked.
  He was the only person there. The room was not large enough for anyone to hide. All it contained was a board of controls and monitors and a chair and a small table. On the table was a tiny plant in a terra cotta pot. The plant was withered, browning at the ends of its leaves, the soil bone dry. Next to the pot was a pitcher of water filled to the brim. At that moment a buzzer lit up on the control board. He went to the board and pushed the button to silence it. Down at the end of the conveyor another pallet was full. The man who wrapped the pallet gave him an OK sign. He pulled the large lever and a claw arm reached down from the blackness where there was no light. The claw picked up the pallet and set it on the back of a truck bed and then retracted into the darkness. It was only then he had a moment to return to the plant on the table. He supposed he was drawn to it because it was the only other living thing in the room. He looked at it for several moment but didn't take a single step away from the control board.
  "Water the plant if you like."
  The voice startled him. It seemed very close to him, but somehow not in the room. He looked for a loud speaker. Could see nothing like that. But it did have a sound like what comes from a loud speaker, thin and distorted. He went to the plant and picked up the pitcher, spilling water on the table. But at the same time the alarm on the control board sounded and also this time there was a flashing red light over one of the gauges. It was serious. He sat the pitcher down and went to the controls. On the floor workers were scrambling to repair the conveyor. Something appeared to be lodged it the gears. He silenced the alarm and when he received the OK signal he pushed a button, at which point the conveyor started up again.
  "Can you hear me?"
  He asked the room.
  "We can."
  "Who are you? What is this place? Why am I here? I want to know what's going on."
  "There may have been some confusion."
  "I am confused. I woke up in a room, wrapped in bandages, and now I'm here at work."
  "That's right, you're here. At work. But when we said there may have been some confusion we didn't mean your confusion about who we are and what this place is and why you are here. What we meant was there was confusion about your role here. Because your role is not to ask questions. Your role is to obey."
  "To hell with you. I'm my own man. You don't know me."
  "But we do know you. We have been watching you for some time now. We know you very well by now. We know you sell drugs. We know you found the computer and the Aura device and used it for your own gain. To steal and rape and even murder. Do you deny those things about yourself?"
  "You know about the device? How? Who are you guys?"
  "We are those who decide and you are he who obeys the decisions and does not question them."
  "Quit saying that stupid shit. You don't own me. I can speak my mind. How do you know the things I done?"
  "We know them. That is the most important thing. Do you deny that you robbed the man in the Super 8, that you raped the woman in Avalon, or that you murdered the husband of your ex-wife in the old Jackson home?"
  "I don't deny those things."
  "Say you did them. We want to hear you say it."
  "I did those things. Happy now?"
  "Would you like to hear what happened to the girl and mother of the man you robbed, because you robbed him? Because something did happen"
  "I don't want to hear that."
  "But you will. The woman was forced to have sex with strange men even more than she was before. He sold her to anyone who would pay cash. To men who abused her in ways inhuman. And there was a particular night she had enough and took a knife she kept hidden under the mattress and stabbed an abusive customer in the face twenty three times. He died in the emergency room. She was arrested for this and sent to jail. She'll be there for a long time. She'll never see her daughter again."
  "I can't listen to any more of this. It's too horrible."
  "Do you know why she'll never see her daughter again?"
  "Stop. Please."
  "The little girl was upset that her mother went to jail and the father got tired of hearing her cry so one night he twisted her arm behind her back and threw her against the wall of the hotel. The impact broke three vertebrae and severed her spine. She was placed in foster care but it will be difficult if not impossible to find a home for her, being that she's lost all feeling from the waist down. She'll never walk again and can't ever have children of her own, from the injuries she sustained. And you played a part in that sequence of events. You admitted it. How does it feel to know that?"
  "Oh, God. Stop talking, please."
  "It's only the truth. What about the woman at Avalon, would you like to hear about her?"
  He did not answer. And the voice continued.
  "She was a mother of two boys. Unhappily married but she had been in counseling with her husband and things were getting better. She was at Avalon to buy an anniversary gift for him, in fact. They had made a vow to one another to not keep each other in the dark and to be honest with their feelings. After your night together she was distraught. She was not wrong to think this might be the straw that finally breaks the camels back and she couldn't deal with that. The guilt of what she did was too much and she drove her SUV into the side of tractor trailer on the interstate and died from her injuries. How does it feel to know that? Answer us."
  "It don't feel good."
  "We don't need to tell you about James. What you did to him."
  "No."
  "But did you know that Suzanne is pregnant? That might be news to you. And now she will have to support both her unborn baby and Joseph. Poor Joseph."
  "Don't you talk about my boy. You don't talk about him. Not to me. I love my boy. I always loved him like a father should love his son. I may not be a good person but you can't take that away from me. I love him with all my heart. And I always will."
  "Has it ever occurred to you that love of offspring is something we share with many animals? Furthermore, this love you feel is chemistry, an evolutionary trait of our biology to enable the survival of the species. That's all it is, this love you feel for your boy. By this measure you are no better than a dog."
  "That's not true. You're twisting it, somehow. It's more than that. I know it is."
  "One thing we should make clear, because we think it may have been lost in the conversation. We don't blame you for anything you've done, or for who you are as a person. We forgive you. Or rather we never had a need to forgive because we expected nothing better from you. Nothing more than who you are. The only thing we expect is that you obey."
  "I see now how it is."
  "Do you? We are not sure. Tell us what you see now. We need to hear you say it aloud."
  He stood for a moment, not speaking.
  "Say it. Now."
  "I ain't free. In my life. I ain't never been free."
  "Thank you. We appreciate your candor. But you are mistaken about your freedom in a significant way. Because you are free."
  "What do you mean by that?"
  "We mean you are free in the simplest way possible. Do you think that door there is locked? It is not. Do you think if you had chosen to do so we would have prevented you from walking out the door, outside? No, we would not have. You were free to do that. And you still are. At this moment you could walk out that door and never see us again. You might even take that plant and we wouldn't do a single thing. Couldn't really do anything about it. Because, how did you put it? You are your own man. But you won't leave this job. And you won't take the plant. But its not because you aren't free to do so. It's because you don't want freedom. Like most people what you really want is an easy life, to grow fat and to be entertained by diversions of every kind, all the way to the grave. You want comfort and you choose it every day of your life. You are choosing it now. To be soothed and pampered and massaged. And you are willing to trade everything else for it, including the most precious thing you have in the world, your life."
  Several times during this diatribe he almost spoke up, almost raised up in anger at the things he was being told about himself, but in the end he said nothing, because he knew in the bottom of his heart that it was all true.
  The alarm sounded and once again he went to the board and completed the process to get the system back online.
