AURA DIM
Daniel Stepp

"At any rate, I've had a good Russian cry over this poor fellow," she added, pointing to Myshkin, who did not even recognize her. "We've had enough of following our whims. It's time to be reasonable. And all this, all this life abroad, and this Europe of yours is all a fantasy, and all of us abroad are only a fantasy. Remember my words, you'll see it for yourself!" she concluded almost wrathfully, as she parted from Yevgeny Pavlovich.

but a pair of glassy eyes.
Raise my feelings one more time."

Tall Grass, Kite, Pickles, Woods, Fried Strawberry Pies

  He flipped down the rear gate of the truck and dug out the blanket and handed it to his boy Joseph, who immediately ran off towards the field, dragging it through the red dirt of the parking area. Suzanne lifted the picnic basket with one hand and cupped her other hand to her mouth and shouted to their son.
  "Joseph Michael, get my blanket off the ground before I drag your ass through it!"
  The boy awkwardly lifted the blanket over his head and kept walking until he reached the tall grass. His wife grabbed the gallon of sweet tea and red plastic cups and headed toward the field.
  "Will, honey, grab the bag of ice when you come."
  "Okay, let me get this kite put together and I'll be over."
  "Don't forget the ice."
  It was a cheap kite they had picked up at the dollar store on the way over here. He opened the bag and attempted to put it together first without the instructions but he couldn't figure out which pole went into which hole and got mad and finally followed the instructions and it was okay. The kite was a rainbow colored butterfly. 
  He wound the string around his hand and held the kite at his side so the wind wouldn't catch it and headed off to where his wife and boy had set the picnic, right in the middle of the field. It took him a few minutes to walk out there and Joseph saw him and ran up and asked to look at the kite.
  "Hold up a minute, let me show you how to do it first. They's a skill to flying a kite. If you don't hold it right its liable to carry you plum over the mountain."
  Joseph grew wide eyed. Then his dad grinned and Joseph laughed. Suzanne was pulling things from the picnic basket, arranging them on the blanket.
  "Did you bring the ice?"
  He shook his head.
  "Shit no."
  "I reminded you to bring it."
  "I heard what you said."
  "Then why didn't you remember to bring the ice, grandpa?"
  "Get off my back, grandma."
  He returned with the ice and saw Joseph playing in the tall green grass. The field was usually mown by April but the county had let it slip this year. The grass went up to his knees. Whenever the wind blew it made gentle waves along the tops. Joseph crawled through the grass like a dog. He popped up every now and then, panting with his tongue hung out. He barked when he saw his father and held up both hands as if he were begging.
  "Hey doggy, you ready to fly this kite or what?"
  The dog boy nodded and jumped to his feet. He ran over and they took the kite out to a little bald spot near the blanket.
He showed Joseph how to measure the direction of the wind by wetting his thumb and holding it up.
  "Now, when you know the direction the wind is blowing, you want to turn your back to the wind and hold the kite up so the wind is blowing into it. Does that make sense?"
  The boy nodded.
  He lifted the kite and the wind filled the sails and ruffled the edges. Joseph jumped behind his father, his eyes wide.
  "Look how the kite catches the wind. That's what you want to see. From here, you make sure to hold onto the spool, like this."
  He grasped the plastic handle of the spool and unwound five loops and let them hang in his other hand.
  "You want just enough line loose so that the kite has enough slack to get into the air and stay there by itself, but not any more than that. Not yet."
  With this he heaved the kite into the wind and it caught the updraft and flew backwards with some force. He let out the slack loops and held the spool with both hands. The line went tight. The kite bobbed against the blue sky, the wind strong. He figured it was a bit too strong for the boy to hold it by himself. But he called him over and let him hold the spool handle with his father.
  "This is incredible!"
  "I know. What do you say we let it get even higher?"
  "Yeah!"
  He showed him how to unwind the spool one loop at a time, safely. The boy studied intently. They unspooled about ten winds and looked at the kite. It was higher now, smaller against the sky. The force of the wind tugged on the spool. He made sure the line wouldn't dig into the boy's hand.
  "It's almost in outer space!"
  "Almost."
  They flew the kite for several minutes. He showed him how to wind the line back onto the spool in case the wind grew slack. The kite dove a couple times and he showed him how to pull back and wind the spool to keep the line taut. In working the kite they had wandered from the picnic site and soon they heard the mother shouting.
  "Ding ding ding, lunch is ready boys, come and get it!"
  Joseph looked disappointed but his father assured him they could fly more once they had eaten lunch. They both pulled in the kite and wound the spool around it. He collapsed the wings and folded it under his arm and they returned to the blanket.
  Lunch was grilled hamburgers, potato chips, and pickles. Suzanne had already poured them cups of sweet tea and had plates set out for each of them. They sat together and ate.
  "Daddy, can I have your pickle?"
  He looked over and saw Joseph had already finished his pickle and chips. The burger remained untouched.
	"Boy you gonna turn into a pickle one of these days."
	"No I ain't."
	"Go on then, eat it and see what happens."
	Joseph reached over and eagerly picked up the pickle. He devoured it in just a few bites. The parent gave each other looks.
	"Suzanne!" he said, "Look at Joseph. Oh my God, he's turning all green. I think he's turning into a pickle!"
	"Oh no!"
	Joseph frowned. He examined his arms and legs then looked up grinning.
	"I'm not a pickle!"
	"Oh yes you are. Now I get to eat you!"
	He grabbed his son under the legs and swung him up and pretended to munch on him. Then he lifted his shirt and blew fart noises on his belly. Joseph laughed and laughed. He set him down and collapsed against his wife, who was leaning on her side. Joseph ran over and sat against his father and mother.
	"Finish that burger and we'll have a treat."
	As the boy picked at his food he nestled into his wife's bosom. Suzanne finished the cup of tea and lay back on the blanket, her head rested on her arm. She feathered his hair and pulled the strands behind his ears.
	"I need a hair cut."
	"Your hair is perfect."
	"That ain't true. I got a bald spot."
	"Your bald spot is perfect."
	He leaned up and kissed his wife on the neck. She kissed his forehead. They looked over and saw Joseph watching them. Joseph came over and lay beside them. The wind picked up and blew the plates into the grass. But no one got up. They laid there, close to one another and looked at the sky. The clouds were moving past. White, billowy clouds. Peaceful clouds. He wondered where they would end up. Those clouds.
	"Daddy?"
	"Yes?"
	"Remember when we were flying the kite?"
	"I do. It wasn't that long ago."
	"No, remember when we were flying the kite and I said it was almost in outer space?"
	"I do."
	"Can a kite go to outer space?"
	"I think so, sure."
	"That's really high."
	"It is."
	"Where will it go then?"
	"What do you mean?"
	"After outer space."
	"Nowhere. There is nowhere else."
	"I don't understand that."
	"Space goes on forever. The kite would fly on forever."
  "How far is forever?"
  "Very far."
  "Can we go there?"
  "No."
  "Why not?"
  "Ask your mother."
  But she was asleep, had fallen asleep listening to the wind blowing through the grass and the trees and also the birds which were chirping. And with their stomachs full the man and his son also fell asleep. They napped and woke an hour later. He woke first and looked at his son asleep on the blanket next to him. He listened to his wife's heartbeat and looked up and saw the sun behind a cloud, shining through.
  Then his wife woke and she wrapped her arm around him and pulled him closer.
  "Baby."
	"What?"
  "Them titties sure do make good pillows."
  "Thanks honey, that's sweet of you to say."
  They laughed and that woke Joseph. He opened his eyes and stared up at his mother and father and smiled.
  "Daddy."
  "Yes, son."
  "I gotta pee."
  "Well, go pee then."
  "Where do I go pee?"
  "By them trees, by the woods. Just walk over there and unzip, just make sure nobody sees your pecker."
  "Will."
  "What?"
  "Don't teach our son to say pecker."
	"Why not?"
	"It's uncouth."
	"I'll show you uncouth."
	He turned to face Suzanne and kissed her neck and behind the ears and placed his hand between her thighs, and felt the warmth there. They kissed. Slow and long and hard. Their tongues entwined. He reached his hand up her shirt and felt her body. That soft skin that always reminded him of when they were teenagers. He felt her breasts and the wetness between her legs. They didn't allow their lust to progress too far however, and eventually lay together, breathing deeply, in time.
	"Baby, we need a house."
	He knew that was coming. Their apartment was too small. Much too small to raise a family in. One bedroom, one bath. No yard.
	A scream. It was Joseph, far away.
	They got up.
  "Where did he go?"
  "To pee?"
  "How long ago was that?"
  "Fifteen minutes, half an hour, I'm not even sure."
  "Where did his voice come from? What direction?"
  "I don't know."
  "The woods?"
  "I don't know."
  Another scream came. He listened. There was crying in the direction of the woods. He took off that way. Suzanne followed behind him.
  "Joseph! I'm coming boy, don't worry."
  He entered the woods at a place where there was a narrow path. The pines grew close together, the floor covered in a blanket of straw.
  "Joseph, say something to daddy! I'm coming. I'm here."
  He stopped for a moment and listened over the beating of his heart. Soon a cry came from his right and he ran in that direction, between the thin, narrow trunks, the low branches hitting him in the face.
  The woods grew deeper, darker the further in he went. The sound of Joseph's voice came from there. In his mind were thoughts of snake bites, spider bites, cougars, bears. The worst possible imagery filled his mind. And guilt. A feeling of guilt.
  "Joseph! Where are you?"
  "Daddy!"
  And then he saw him. The light dim. Tangled in a briar patch, his jacket ripped on the thorns, his arms bleeding, his cheek scratched.
  "Son, stay still. I'll get you out. Don't move around."
  Joseph was crying. He was in pain. The thorns had cut him pretty bad. He saw all that as he got out his pocket knife and cut through the thick limbs. Finally he was free and they went to a clearing and he looked his son up and down. Only scratches. But he was shivering, afraid. He knelt and held him close and felt his shivering in his arms. He didn't say anything. He held him close.
  After five minutes he picked up his son and carried him out. He called out to Suzanne that everything was okay. When they emerged back into the sunlight she ran over and looked her son over. They took him to the blanket. He went to the pickup and got some rags he kept in the back seat and tended to his wounds. He shivered for some time still, disturbed, frightened.
  His mother took out some fried strawberry pies from the picnic basket and broke them into pieces and put them on a plate for them all. They sat together and ate the pies and eventually things returned to normal and the good feeling returned and Joseph asked if they could fly the kite again, and they did.
  
Vintage Dodge, Notebook, Weekly-Rate Hotel, Beating of Neighbor, Eleven O Clock News

Headlight beams from a vintage Dodge Dart moved over the alleyway behind Huffaker Crossing, the abandoned strip mall where the Krogers used to be, where he liked to meet up with customers this side of town. Light shined into his pickup cabin, blinding him momentarily, as the the beater pulled next to him and stopped. Nobody made the first move. It was so quiet they could hear the sleet falling onto the vehicles, the wind moaning through the power and phone cables swinging overhead. Paint flaking off the corners of the doors and the concrete pylons that shielded the air conditioning units, rust in those places. Everything cast in amber hue, from a pole at the other end of the corridor. Behind the alley was a thin tree line, behind which was an unused railroad track and beyond that a trailer park of Mexicans. At last the man in the pickup donned his hood, zipped up his jacket, and got out slowly, his right hand on a revolver in his right jacket pocket. He walked around to the passenger side, opened the door, motioned for the girl to slide over. He got in.
  [They are afraid of him, treating him like a dangerous animal, he senses it, feels glad]
  The girlfriend got out first, tight jeans, black halter, an exposed midriff even in this cold, visible stretch marks, the kindness in her eyes a giveaway. She greeted him.
  "Tina."
  Then he spoke to the boyfriend who was taking his sweet time with something in the car.
  "It's cold man. Let's do this thing."
  "Dude, what you gave us last time was straight," the girlfriend interrupted with a grin, the sound of her voice uncouth, gravelly, harsher than a female voice should be at her age.
  "Good."
  The boyfriend got out and slid up next to her. He put his arm around her waist. The man noticed some kind of bundle tucked underneath his arm, wrapped in a garbage bag. The two of them exchanged a glance so subtle it would have gone unnoticed any other night.
  "What's in the bag?" He asked.
  "Tell him babe."
  The boyfriend gave a look like he was going to slap her down.
  "I got this."
  The man palmed the gun in his pocket.
  "What's in the bag?"
  "It's cool, Will, it's cool. Chill man."
  "Don't tell me it's cool. Don't tell me to chill. Just tell me what's in that bag under your arm. Right now. Or I'm gone."
  The boyfriend glanced at the jacket pocket, assuming what his hand grasped inside. His eyes grew panicked and then he lifted both hands in an effort to calm the situation.
  "Will, dude, it's just a notebook. That's all it is. Man I knowed I should of just told you on the text. Tina said you wouldn't hear us out if I brung it up over the phone."
  "Don't blame me," she said, cupping both hands over a lighter, with a fresh cigarette dangling in her mouth. She lit and blew the smoke into the air. The sores around her mouths and eyes, the bitten nails with flaking polish, the stringy hair. He had a glimpse from their school days, her sitting in Algebra, behind him, shoe dangling off her foot, bored. 
  Suddenly he felt an agitation at having to deal with this bullshit, with the both of them, out in the cold, out in the night in this place.
  "What do you mean a notebook? What are you talking about?"
  "Show him."
  The boyfriend watched him, his eyes asking permission before moving. The man granted it.
  He set the package down on the hood of his car and unwrapped it. All the time he kept his eyes on his jacket pocket. He was not naive, Grady, just strung out. In a moment he had the bag off and held it out to him.
  "A computer?"
  "A notebook computer. Ain't that what they call them?"
  "It's a laptop, hon."
  "Whatever. Laptop. Notebook," he said, "It's a real nice one, as you can see. No scratches or dings or nothin. Works good too."
  The man regarded the computer but said nothing, just looked at them.
  "This thing you could sell on Craigslist for a thousand bucks. A thousand easy. We looked it up online."
  "But then we got to thinking," she stepped in, her voice softening, "to save time, what if you just let us give it to you in exchange for the ball? Then you could make a ton off just this one trade. Just this one time, you know. From now on we have cash."
  The boyfriend interrupted, selling it.
  "It works good, we tried it out. We can show you, its even got some battery left. No cord though. But you can get one of them at the Wal-Mart for cheap."
  The man understood. His finger relaxed on the trigger. There was no conspiracy, no LEO, no thugs around the corner, waiting to pounce. Just some fiends desperate to pawn off some loot for a fix.
  "Turn it on," he said to them.
  The boyfriend nodded.
  "Sure thing, Will. Let me show you how bright the screen be on this bad boy. Picture look sharp too. Top of the line right here. Don't make em any better."
  The computer was a nice one, the smooth aluminum body in good shape, no dings or scratches like he said. Keys all there, seemed to work. When it came on there was a bright green lock screen, and the noticed a single user account with an avatar showing picture of a DNA strand, which he pretended not to see.
  He stood back and considered their proposal, but there wasn't much to consider. No doubt he could have it sold by tomorrow, especially if he advertised on the Atlanta board. The tweakers also knew how much it was worth. It was just the disease had them in such a thrall that it didn't matter. They needed that fix to geek out and only tonight would do. So him standing back was a pose to make it seem like he was doing them a favor by accepting the offer, to have that to hold over them when the time came.
  "Whatcha think?" The girlfriend finally said, after nearly a minute of silence. The boyfriend nearly came out of his skin, his eyes widening in her direction, afraid she might blow the whole deal and they would have to endure the night sober.
  He regarded them both with careful eyes and then ran his fingers along the outside of the notebook and over the keyboard and then closed the lid.
