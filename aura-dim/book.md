  He unlatched the tailgate and dug out the blanket and handed it to his boy Joseph who immediately drug it off towards the field, carrying it with awkward hands through the dirt of the parking area. Suzanne took out the picnic basket and cupped her free hand to her mouth and shouted to their son.
  "Boy, get that blanket off the ground or I'll whip that tail!"
  Joseph lifted the blanket over his head and kept walking until he reached the tall grass. His wife also grabbed the gallon of sweet tea and red plastic cups and then headed toward the field.
  "Will, honey, grab the bag of ice when you come."
  "Okay, let me get this kite put together and I'll be over."
  "Don't forget the ice."
  It was a cheap kite they had picked up at the dollar store on the way over here. He opened the bag and attempted to put it together first without the instructions but he couldn't figure out which pole went into which hole and got mad and finally followed the instructions and it was okay. The kite was a rainbow colored butterfly. 
  He wound the string around his hand and held the kite at his side so the wind wouldn't catch it and headed off to where his wife and boy had set the picnic, right in the middle of the field. It took him a few minutes to walk out there and Joseph saw him and ran up and asked to look at the kite.
  "Hold up a minute, let me show you how to do it first. They's a skill to flying a kite. If you don't hold it right its liable to carry you plum over the mountain."
  Joseph grew wide eyed. Then his dad grinned and Joseph laughed. Suzanne was pulling things from the picnic basket, arranging them on the blanket.
  "Did you bring the ice?"
  He shook his head.
  "Shit no."
  "I reminded you to bring it."
  "I heard what you said."
  "Then why didn't you remember to bring the ice, grandpa?"
  "Get off my back, grandma."
  He returned with the ice and saw Joseph playing in the tall green grass. The field was usually mown by April but the county had let it slip this year. The grass went up to his knees. Whenever the wind blew it made gentle waves along the tops. Joseph crawled through the grass like a dog. He popped up every now and then, panting with his tongue hung out. He barked when he saw his father and held up both hands as if he were begging.
  "Hey doggy, you ready to fly this kite or what?"
  The dog boy nodded and jumped to his feet. He ran over and they took the kite out to a little bald spot near the blanket.
He showed Joseph how to measure the direction of the wind by wetting his thumb and holding it up.
  "Now, when you know the direction the wind is blowing, you want to turn your back to the wind and hold the kite up so the wind is blowing into it. Does that make sense?"
  The boy nodded.
  He lifted the kite and the wind filled the sails and ruffled the edges. Joseph jumped behind his father, his eyes wide.
  "Look how the kite catches the wind. That's what you want to see. From here, you make sure to hold onto the spool, like this."
  He grasped the plastic handle of the spool and unwound five loops and let them hang in his other hand.
  "You want just enough line loose so that the kite has enough slack to get into the air and stay there by itself, but not any more than that. Not yet."
  With this he heaved the kite into the wind and it caught the updraft and flew backwards with some force. He let out the slack loops and held the spool with both hands. The line went tight. The kite bobbed against the blue sky, the wind strong. He figured it was a bit too strong for the boy to hold it by himself. But he called him over and let him hold the spool handle with his father.
  "This is incredible!"
  "I know. What do you say we let it get even higher?"
  "Yeah!"
  He showed him how to unwind the spool one loop at a time, safely. The boy studied intently. They unspooled about ten winds and looked at the kite. It was higher now, smaller against the sky. The force of the wind tugged on the spool. He made sure the line wouldn't dig into the boy's hand.
  "It's almost in outer space!"
  "Almost."
  They flew the kite for several minutes. He showed him how to wind the line back onto the spool in case the wind grew slack. The kite dove a couple times and he showed him how to pull back and wind the spool to keep the line taut. In working the kite they had wandered from the picnic site and soon they heard the mother shouting.
  "Ding ding ding, lunch is ready boys, come and get it!"
  Joseph looked disappointed but his father assured him they could fly more once they had eaten lunch. They both pulled in the kite and wound the spool around it. He collapsed the wings and folded it under his arm and they returned to the blanket.
  Lunch was grilled hamburgers, potato chips, and pickles. Suzanne had already poured them cups of sweet tea and had plates set out for each of them. They sat together and ate.
  "Daddy, can I have your pickle?"
  "Eat your own pickle."
  "I already ate it."
  He looked over and saw Joseph had already finished his pickle and chips. The burger remained untouched.
	"Boy, you gonna turn into a pickle one of these days, if you ain't careful."
  The boy laughed.
	"No I ain't, daddy!"
	"Go on then."
	Joseph reached over and eagerly picked up the pickle. He devoured it in just a few bites. The parent gave each other looks.
	"Suzanne!" he said, "Look at Joseph. Oh my God he's turnin green. He's turnin into a pickle!"
	"Oh no!"
	Joseph frowned. He examined his arms and legs then looked up grinning.
	"I ain't a pickle!"
	"Oh yes you are. Now I get to eat you!"
	He grabbed his son under the legs and swung him up and pretended to munch on him. Then he lifted his shirt and blew fart noises on his belly. Joseph laughed and laughed. He set him down and collapsed against his wife, who was leaning on her side. Joseph ran over and sat against his father and mother.
	"Finish that burger and we'll have a treat."
	As the boy picked at his food he nestled into his wife's bosom. Suzanne finished the cup of tea and lay back on the blanket, her head rested on her arm. She feathered his hair and pulled the strands behind his ears.
	"I need a hair cut."
	"Your hair is perfect."
	"That ain't true. I got a bald spot."
	"Your bald spot is perfect."
	He leaned up and kissed his wife on the neck. She kissed his forehead. They looked over and saw Joseph watching them. Joseph came over and lay beside them. The wind picked up and blew the plates into the grass. But no one got up. They laid there, close to one another and looked at the sky. The clouds were moving past. White, billowy clouds. Peaceful clouds. He wondered where they would end up. Those clouds.
	"Daddy?"
	"Yes?"
	"Remember when we were flying the kite?"
	"I do. It wasn't that long ago."
	"No, remember when we were flying the kite and I said it was almost in outer space?"
	"I do."
	"Can a kite go to outer space?"
	"I think so."
	"That's really high."
	"Oh yeah."
	"Where will it go then?"
	"What you mean?"
	"After outer space."
	"Nowhere. There ain't nowhere else."
	"I don't understand that."
	"Space goes on forever."
  "How far is that?"
  "Very."
  "Can we go there?"
  "No."
  "Why not?"
  "I don't know. Ask your mother."
  But she was asleep, had fallen asleep listening to the wind blowing through the grass and the trees and also the birds which were chirping. And with their stomachs full the man and his son also fell asleep. They napped and woke an hour later. He woke first and looked at his son asleep on the blanket next to him. He listened to his wife's heartbeat and looked up and saw the sun behind a cloud, shining through.
  Then his wife woke and she wrapped her arm around him and pulled him closer.
  "Baby."
	"What?"
  "Them titties sure do make good pillows."
  "Thanks honey, that's sweet of you to say."
  They laughed and that woke Joseph. He opened his eyes and stared up at his mother and father and smiled.
  "Daddy."
  "Yes?"
  "I gotta pee."
  "Well go pee then."
  "Where do I go pee?"
  "By them trees, by the woods. Just walk over there and unzip, just make sure nobody sees your pecker."
  "Will."
  "What?"
  "Don't teach our son to say pecker."
	"Why not?"
	"It's uncouth."
	"I'll show you uncouth."
	He turned to face Suzanne and kissed her neck and behind the ears and placed his hand between her thighs, and felt the warmth there. They kissed. Slow and long and hard. Their tongues entwined. He reached his hand up her shirt and felt her body. That soft skin that always reminded him of when they were teenagers. He felt her breasts and the wetness between her legs. They didn't allow their lust to progress too far however, and eventually lay together, breathing deeply, in time.
	"Baby, we need a house."
	He knew that was coming. Their apartment was too small. Much too small to raise a family in. One bedroom, one bath. No yard.
  "After we see what happens with these layoffs at the plant and I know I still got a job. It'll have to wait till then."
	A scream. It was Joseph, far away.
	They got up.
  "Where did he go?"
  "To pee?"
  "How long ago was that?"
  "Fifteen minutes, half an hour, I'm not even sure."
  "Where did his voice come from? What direction?"
  "I don't know."
  "The woods?"
  "I don't know."
  Another scream came. He listened. There was crying in the direction of the woods. He took off that way. Suzanne followed behind him.
  "Joseph! I'm coming boy, don't worry."
  He entered the woods at a place where there was a narrow path. The pines grew close together, the floor covered in a blanket of straw.
  "Joseph, say something to daddy! I'm coming. I'm here."
  He stopped for a moment and listened over the beating of his heart. Soon a cry came from his right and he ran in that direction, between the thin, narrow trunks, the low branches hitting him in the face.
  The woods grew deeper, darker the further in he went. The sound of Joseph's voice came from there. In his mind were thoughts of snake bites, spider bites, cougars, bears. The worst possible imagery filled his mind. And guilt. A feeling of guilt.
  "Joseph! Where are you?"
  "Daddy!"
  And then he saw him. The light dim. Tangled in a briar patch, his jacket ripped on the thorns, his arms bleeding, his cheek scratched.
  "Son, stay still. I'll get you out. Don't move around."
  Joseph was crying. He was in pain. The thorns had cut him pretty bad. He saw all that as he got out his pocket knife and cut through the thick limbs. Finally he was free and they went to a clearing and he looked his son up and down. Only scratches. But he was shaking. He knelt and held his son close and felt his little body shaking in his arms. He didn't say anything. He held him close.
  After five minutes he picked up his son and carried him out of the woods. He called out to Suzanne that everything was okay. When they emerged she ran over and looked her son over. They carried him to the blanket. He went to the pickup and got some rags and tended to his wounds. His mother brought out the fried strawberry pies from the picnic basket and placed them on a paper plate. They sat together and ate the pies without talking. They each felt the breeze in their hair and the warm sunlight of the afternoon on their tired faces and eventually Joseph got up and whispered into his father's ear asking if they could fly the kite one more time. And they did.

"At any rate, I've had a good Russian cry over this poor fellow," she added, pointing to Myshkin, who did not even recognize her. "We've had enough of following our whims. It's time to be reasonable. And all this, all this life abroad, and this Europe of yours is all a fantasy, and all of us abroad are only a fantasy. Remember my words, you'll see it for yourself!" she concluded almost wrathfully, as she parted from Yevgeny Pavlovich.

  Headlight beams fell onto a toppled shopping cart in the alleyway behind Huffaker Crossing, an abandoned strip mall where the Krogers used to be, where he liked to meet up with customers this side of town. *That Dodge makes enough racket to wake up the dead*, the man in the pickup thought. *Grady's kiddin himself if he thinks he'll ever restore that old piece of shit. Poor motherfucker*. The Dodge turned into the darkened area where his pickup truck sat idle and the beams entered the cabin and blinded him. He shielded his eyes as it pulled up. The headlights switched off but the motor was kept running, smoke curling from its tailpipe. As he waited, the man in the pickup listened to the patter of sleet on the rooftops and the moans of wind through the power lines overhead. He observed the paint flaking off the corners of the doors and the concrete pylons that shielded the air conditioning units, rust in those places. Everything was cast in amber hue, from a pole at the other end of the corridor. Behind the alleyway was a thin tree line, behind which was an unused railroad track and beyond that a trailer park of Mexicans.
  He had arrived nearly half an hour ago. He always did. There was a classic rock n roll tune called *Waiting for the Man* with a lyric that went, *first thing you learn is that you always got to wa-hait*. What horseshit. Nowadays it was. The way it was now, you get there before the other guy. Always. Scope things out, peer behind the bins and around all the corners. Under rocks. Everywhere. Be like a fiend yourself, paranoid. No doubt that was why he was still breathing while many others he knew of were not.
  The door to the pickup opened and in slid a woman and a man. 
  "Shut the goddamn door. Its fucking cold out here."
  The man slammed the door. The woman lit up a cigarette and opened the tray in the console. Between his legs the man held a backpack of unknown contents.
  "Will baby, how you been, darlin?"
  "Jenn."
  "Yo, what up Will. Thanks for meeting us so late."
  "Grady."
  Jenn ashed her cigarette in the tray. She was thin. As thin as he had ever seen her. Hair wiry, greasy. Fingernails bitten to the quick. Body odor. Skin ashen, pockmarked. And those teeth. Jesus Christ. He remembered a time she had been attractive. Beautiful even. Back then her hands didn't shake like that when she smoked. Back then there was light behind her eyes.
  "Dude, what you gave us last time was straight. We was trippin balls for like seven days, I swear to God!"
  He said nothing, only palmed the handgun in his left jacket pocket. Nodded. Then with his right hand he pulled out the eight ball, tied in a plastic baggie. Both their eyes went there, squinted.
  "Well there it is," Jenn said, "But here's the thing Will, this here is me and Grady's last score. We going straight edge. God as my witness."
  He didn't respond, only looked at them both.
  "Tell you something else," she continued, "That shit right there. That shit will kill you. Deader then hell. You bet your ass. It robs you of your life. It robs you of your kids. It don't care one iota. It robs you of everything. You oughta be ashamed to sell this to people. It’s devilish. It’s ungodly."
  "Shut the the fuck up, Jenn," Grady said, "man don't need a lecture."
  "Well I'm sorry, but you know me, I ain't got no filters. I just tell it like it is."
  "Three hundred."
  The tweakers looked at Will. Both nodded and then Jenn turned to Grady and gestured to the backpack in the floorboard.
  "Show him, babe."
  Grady reached down and unzipped the backpack. But as he did so Will pulled the gun from his jacket pocket and aimed the barrel at Grady.
  "The fuck you doing?"
  Grady raised both hands, palms out, innocent.
  "Bro, its cool. I swear."
  "Its just a notebook. That's all it is."
  He looked from Grady to Jenn. For a few moments in the pickup it was totally silent, except for the heater blower and a low song playing on the radio.
  "Let me explain, Will."
  He looked at Grady.
  "Man, basically its like this. Me and Jenn had a job tonight. On the down low if you know what I mean. They said we could take whatever shit we found, from the place, and we got this notebook and backpack. We won't be getting paid until next week for the job but figured we could get a ball from you, and maybe pay you with this notebook, which is worth a hell of a lot more than three hundred. That's for damn sure."
  He grew impatient with their stupidity, with their naive attempt to manipulate him. He snapped. "What the fuck do you mean notebook? Start making sense, or I don't know what I'll do."
  "I told you we should have asked him ahead of time, Grady."
  "Bullshit, Jenn! You told me we needed to wait, show him in person. Throw me under the bus, you fucking bitch!"
  "Don't call me a bitch, motherfucker. I'm the best thing you ever had in your life."
  "Hardly," Grady laughed.
  "Hand me the backpack."
  Grady looked at Will, then nodded. He reached for the bag.
  "Not you. Let Jenn do it."
  Jenn put down her cigarette. She reached for the bag.
  "Slower. I don't want to see your hand anywhere near the zipper."
  She slowed down, picked up the backpack by the shoulder straps and held it out to Will. He unzipped the bag with his free hand and reached inside and pulled out an aluminum computer, silver, in perfect condition.
  "A computer? Why didn't you just say so?"
  Grady shrugged.
  "Hell I don't know, I always call em notebooks. Ain't that what you call em?"
  "They're laptops babe."
  "Well you didn't help clarify anything before."
  "Fuck off, Jenn."
  "Don't tell me to fuck off, Grady. You don't talk to me like that!"
	"Shut the fuck up you two."
	They stopped cold and looked to Will. He said nothing. He handed the computer over to Grady.
	"Turn it on."
	Grady lifted the lid, pushed a button and the screen turned on, the keyboard lit up, and the fans started blowing.
	"It takes a few minutes to get crunk up. But it's a real nice one, as you can see. No scratches or dings or nothin. This thing you could sell on Craigslist for a thousand bucks. A thousand easy. We looked it up online."
  "But then we got to thinking," Jenn stepped in, her voice softening, "to save time, what if you just let us give it to you in exchange for a ball? Then you could make a ton off just this one score. Just this one time, you know."
  Grady interrupted, selling it.
  "It works good, see, we tested it out. Its even got some battery left. Got all the wires, in the bag there."
  The login screen lit up the inside of the cabin, a green leafy background. Grady typed in a few keys to show that it worked. A message popped up that the password was incorrect.
  He put the handgun pack into his jacket pocket and reached over and grabbed the computer. It was heavy in his hand. Solidly  built. Brand new from the looks of it.
  "So whatddya think?" Jenn asked, with such brazen confidence that Grady shot her a look.
  Will said nothing. He merely regarded them both with skeptical eyes and ran his fingers along the outside and over the keyboard and then closed the lid and weighed it in hand.
  
  Inside, he set the backpack on the desk and walked to the kitchenette carrying a sackful of Krystals. He pulled a pint of Wild Turkey from the top of the fridge and poured two fingers into a dirty glass, added an ice cube, and then fell back onto the bed with the drink and the burgers, flipping through the basic cable stations that came with the room.
  After he was stuffed and his was head spinning. He knew in the morning he would regret eating these gut bombs so late. But fuck it. He stumbled to the kitchenette and poured another and began pacing the hotel room. Someday soon he would be out of this. Then he might be able to regain some kind of control, might move out of this shithole and get a regular place again, a real place. Get a dog. He thought about what Grady and Tina were doing in this moment, their minds obliterated on the drugs, there on the couch in their shit trailer out in Kingston. Obliterated but in love. He remembered how he had once been in love. In that moment his stomach turned and he ran into the bathroom and chucked burgers and whisky into the toilet. It was this place, the filth, the cigarette smoke. Always the stale smell of it. He rose from the toilet, wiped his mouth and brushed his teeth and washed his face and looked at himself in the mirror.
  Back in the kitchenette he poured another drink. The clock read four thirty. In a few hours it would be daylight and impossible anymore for him to sleep. The curtains were no good, there was a big area at the sides where the sunlight came in brighter than all hell. So he would be tired all tomorrow. He walked to the window overlooking the parking lot. In the office on the other side he saw the fluorescent lights on, the little Indian man who ran the hotel awake, drinking coffee. He was a hard worker. He reminded him a bit of Nanda, a man he used to work with at Beaulieu before they shut the doors in 2009. He had worked the extruder there for going on fifteen years. Had seniority, was always asked to train the new guys moving up from the floor. Nanda was on the sanitation team and they used to see each other all the time in the break room, do the old routine,
  "How's it hanging, Nanda?"
  The little guy then adjusted his crotch.
  "Little to the left today, Will" he would answer, "Thanks for asking, my friend."
  Beaulieu was also where he met up with Glenn, who he used to go  out camping with up in Mentone, near Little River Canyon. Glenn was the one who introduced him to Danny, who sold him weed for their camping trips. And now he worked for Rodriguez from Kennesaw, who supplied Danny and now him. That's how it happens. And one time getting robbed at gunpoint during a Craigslist meet up. Whole stash took, just one time, and Rodriguez goes from friendly to fierce. It's just business, he tells me. That's just the way it goes. In the hole for 100K. I'll never be free from this life.
  Out the window he saw a van swerve into the lot and park sideways on the side opposite of his room. Two black men got out and went to door 104 and banged on it with their fists. The curtain in the room opened and then the door cracked but with the safety latch in place. One of the men stood back and kicked the door in. Then the both of them rushed inside and beat the shit out of the man inside. He assumed it was a man, all he saw was them huddled over some dark shape, punching and kicking, furiously. A girl appeared in the door and shouted for help. The men rose and pushed her into the room, and then left. His eyes went to the Indian in the office, who was looking in the direction of the room, on the phone. The men came out, breathing hard, got in the car, and sped off. The entire thing didn't last more than a few minutes. He could see the man inside writhing on the floor, the girl hovering over him.
  He was far from it. Only dimly did he hear the sirens of the ambulance when it arrived. Everything was unreal. The room was spinning, so he sat down on the hard chair and put his head in his hands, but that only made the spinning worse. He wretched again and came back and lay on the bed. Thoughts of Suzanne and his old life, camping with Glenn, high as a kite and talking shit about the existence of God, his old job at the carpet mill. His boy.
  His eyes went to the television on the dresser. It was the news, a replay of the eleven o clock news. There had been an explosion at a research lab at the local college. Helicopter footage of the building in flames, charred debris at the windows and doorways, completely destroyed. No survivors the newswoman said. They showed pictures of them. Young, grad students. Then there was a cutaway to some video footage outside the place, a closeup of Grady and Jenn, carrying a gasoline can and other tools into the building. He rose from the bed but the dizziness caused him to fall off. He got to his feet and slapped himself and tried to pay attention but he was too drunk, the details were slipping by him. Then there was some grainy footage of a Dodge Dart driving off, the tail lights and smoke unmistakable. Then there was a number at the bottom of the screen to call for any information. Then the story was over and they moved on to the weather.
  His went to the computer on the dresser. He lifted the lid and turned it on. Once again he looked at the account avatar, the cute graphic of a DNA strand, and a username, z.jackson. It was password protected.
  From the corner of his eye he saw the red and blue flashing lights behind the curtain and in his drunken state he was startled by them. He knelt low and crawled to the window, peering out. It was only then he remembered the beating and the ambulance. Now two patrol cars were also in the parking lot, a group of them talking near room 104. He rose to his feet and saw others in other rooms watching, like him. There was a flash from a camera and he saw one of the officers putting a cell phone back into his pocket, facing him. The girl was crying, crossing her arms in the cold, giving a statement to one of the police. The other police in the group leered from the corners of their eyes. All she wore was a thin silk gown. In this cold. He found himself also fixated on the shape of the woman, on her breasts through the gown, on her nipples through the silk. He remembered the first time he kissed Suzanne, Spring break in Panama City Beach. He worked up the courage and asked her to walk the fishing pier with him. She said yes. After they went dancing. He was not the dancing type but he liked to dance with her. They walked down to the beach and he took a chance and kissed her slowly on the cheek, awkwardly. They dropped to the sand and he kissed her neck and looked up and saw her eyes closed in ecstasy. He lifted her shirt and kissed her smooth, pale stomach, lifted her bra and kissed her breasts. Then he kissed her deeply and could still remember how their embrace felt, close, as if two souls were holding onto the other at the edge of an abyss. He thought of their time together, then years later, just after the delivery of their son. It hurt him to think of his son.
  The police were gone. The door to room 104 was closed. The woman in the silk robe nowhere to be seen. Just over the roof of the hotel the sky was fading from night to dim, pinkish gray. Morning commuters in traffic on the road beside the hotel. His head had stopped spinning at last but his mind was far from clear. His eyes landed on the pool in the center of the parking lot, unkept, unused in years, covered with a tarp partially blown open. Green, stagnant water lapped at the sides of the once ocean blue lining, now a hard plastic white. The sight of it took him to a vacation with his dad and brother and sister, to Fernandina beach when they were just kids. Though they had never seen the ocean they were more excited about the pool at the hotel and their dad reluctantly agreed to let them leave the beach to go there for the afternoon. How clearly he could still remember the smell of that water and the bright orange arm floats his little brother wore, only five. The brown siding of the hotel, the bright blue against it, looking up. The white clouds. It was all there as if it were yesterday, funny how clearly he could still recall that time and even smell it. Then a feeling inside of how far he was from those days, at how happy he had been then, at how fun it all was and how his life would never again been so much fun. He thought about that and thought about Joseph and if he would ever remember back on him as he remembered his own father and that was the last thing he thought before sleep took him.

 He awoke with his head at the foot of the bed, under every bit of blanket and sheets there were. No pillow. He slept that direction to be closer to the heater. Using his left arm as a pillow had cut off its circulation. He moved his arm for several minutes before the pinpricks faded. He had slept hard in the night and had not dreamed. There had been a heaviness to his sleep that was hard to shake off, hard to keep his eyes open. It was not just the whiskey, though it didn't help. The TV was still on. Such was his dreamy state of mind, one second the room was silent then the next he heard the sound of it blaring, a particularly obnoxious commercial about breakfast cereal. He lay there and listened, his eyes still too heavy to get out of the bed. Soon he heard the news, a beautiful Latina voice reading the local headlines from the Atlanta metro area.

  "Top story this morning, we have updates on the break-in and subsequent explosion, which occurred last night at a technology research center on the Berry College campus in North Georgia. Footage was recovered which showed an old car speeding through the security gate at 11:05 pm. The car drove to the research center and two suspects emerged with garden tools and a can of gasoline. They broke into the building, as seen on this footage, by smashing the glass doors, triggering the alarm. Ten minutes later they emerge from the building, carrying unidentified objects, and speed away. Approximately 11:37 pm an explosion occurs in the east side of the building, and slowly spreads until it is visible on the security tape, here. It was thought originally the building was empty, but we have confirmation from school security there was a single student logged into the building, apparently working late, and so far authorities have not been able to locate this student. We have approval from local police to show an image of the student, who has been identified as Zoey Jackson, a graduate student in the computer science program at the college."
	
  He arose and watched the story intently, the recollection of the news from last night coming back to him, slowly, vaguely. His blurred vision focused on the image of the student, a nice looking black girl, smirking, the mugshot-like quality of the photograph obviously from her student identification.
  
  "Ms. Jackson has so far not been found, nor reached by contact information on school records. Police have begun a search for Ms. Jackson and would like us to provide a phone number where you may call anonymously to provide information, about this incident. If you do have information, either regarding the whereabouts of Ms. Jackson or the two perpetrators, please call the number at the bottom of the screen. In other news..."
  
   It came back to him, how he had recognized the unmistakable tail lights of that old Dodge in his drunken state last night. But then there was just a blank. Nothing. He remembered nothing else. But it was them. Who else would drive such a piece of shit? And then it hit him. He shook off the remnants of sleep and went to the table by the window. There on the table was the notebook, the computer Grady and Jenn had convinced him to trade for the drugs last night. He opened the lid and turned it on. The login screen came up and he recognized the username from last night, z.jackson.
   He shut the lid and went to his phone. It lay next to the bag of half-eaten Krystals, now crawling with roaches, feeding on the dried onions and mustard. "No. No. Fuck no," he said, and then let out another tortured *Fuck no* when he saw his last text to Grady,
   
  the fuck did this computer come from? u r on 11 news! txt me back soon
   
  He looked at the text in disbelief and finally tossed it on the bed. He paced the room for the next fifteen minutes, stopping only to vomit in the toilet, a combination of nerves and the hangover. He poured some water from the bathroom faucet and drank it down. His mouth was dry and now slimed and the cold water washed away the acid taste. He went to the window and peaked out, the parking lot during the day emptied out as the out-of-town construction workers and electricians went to work. Nobody was outside. He saw the woman who worked the day shift in the office, on the phone. Then he turned back to the room.
  He went to the bathroom and pulled down a rag hung over the shower rod, wet it and returned to the computer. He wiped it down, picking it up with a t-shirt, both inside and out. Then he placed it in the Krystal bag and tied a knot. Roaches escaped and scurried behind the mirror. He put on his jacket and beanie and took another peak out the window. Nobody. He grabbed his wallet and keys and went out the door.
  Outside he turned to the right, where an old busted washer and drier sat unused. Then the ice machine, which was. The only thing past the machines was a small empty yard behind the office and a chainlink fence marking the boundary of property. He went towards the yard, around the end of the building and turned a corner to the right. This led him to the alley behind the rooms, a narrow dirt path parallel to the fence, woods behind. Now the bathroom window of all the rooms overlooked this alley, so he knelt low and crept as fast as he could with the bag in hand, all the way down.
  At the other end of the building, around that corner, was a brown garbage bin. There was a thin row of pines separating the bin from the road, sidewalk, morning traffic going by. The bin was closed from this side, since everybody used the more convenient side facing the hotel entrance. But he wanted to remain unseen. He waited and then when he was sure nobody was around he crept up beneath the back of the bin. He slid open the backside and tossed in the bag then closed it. Then he went back the way he came, the same way he went before, creeping, quiet.
  He got in his pickup and looked at the text once again. He nearly picked up the phone to call Grady, then thought better of that. He nearly sent a text, then realized just how stupid he was being. He pumped the gas a couple times then turned the ignition. He let it warm up then pulled out and headed down Martha Berry then up the bypass, towards Kingston.
  The local station was playing music, top 40, interrupting only for weather updates, more cold, black ice on bridges, but no news about the break-in. No panic. He kept a close watch in his mirrors for any police. He was taking a chance but the data on that phone was incriminating. He was sure it was a burner, he didn't deal with folks who didn't have one, but as long as it was on their person it could incriminate him. And that could not happen. He went the long way, around Ward mountain, instead of the more direct route. He came up Price Road where he knew there was a dirt utility road leading into the woods which surrounded the trailer park where they lived. He drove up and down the road a couple times, to lookout for any police, any suspicious vehicles. Nothing. It was still soon. Good he acted when he did.
  He turned into the utility road and navigated the deep ruts and icy mud holes until he was well hidden amongst the pines. He tucked the gun into his jacket pocket and got out. He made a best guess which way into the woods would lead him to their trailer. He had only been there once, years ago, when he and Grady were drinking buddies and not customer client. The dried leaves made so much noise as he shuffled into the woods he wondered if this was a better idea than just driving up. He did his best and tried not to shuffle as best he could.
  Gusts of wind blew through the pines. He stopped and leaned against a tree. In the clearing he spied the backside of a trailer. He kept walking. Soon he emerged from the wood line, creeping along the edge of it, where he would hopefully remain unseen. Down towards the cul-de-sac he recognized the faded yellow siding on Grady and Jenn's single wide, behind which was a shoddy porch and natural gas tank. Pulled into the trees nearby was the old Dodge, well hidden by broken branches and leaves piled on top. He went up the steps of the back porch.
  Through the back window he saw the stove overhead light on, fast food wrappers on the counter, though sunlight beamed through the living room window, next to the entertainment center, a cheap shelf with a small flat screen TV on top, The Wizard of Oz playing on it. No signs of Grady and Jenn. No signs at all. He drew his gun and knelt beside the door, then rapped twice with his knuckles, quietly. A minute passed, he knocked again, louder this time. Waited. Two more minutes, nothing.
  He thought to text Grady, let him know he was back there. He thought they might be hiding. It's possible they were on the run, but knowing them, not likely. He banged on the door with his fist, waited a minute, and heard nothing. On the left end of the trailer was a small bedroom window. He crept around and climbed onto a rusted-out riding lawnmower underneath it. Cupping his hands around the pane he tried to make out what was inside, but it was too dark. With no affordance from the outside to lift the window he pushed up against it with his palms and after a few moments of steady force it creaked up a few inches.
  His left foot came down on a toy box made of cardboard. It sunk under his weight but held enough for him to get the footing he needed to heave his body through the narrow opening. His back  scraped against the metal frame and hurt like hell, but he remained silent, pulling his right leg through the window and setting down gently on the floor. There were toys piled here. A crib stuffed with boxes. Diapers in the corner. A moon and star mobile still hanging from one of the panels in the ceiling, glittering in the light from the still open window. Wooden blocks strewn on the floor and he stepped around them as he approached the door to listen.
  Silence. 
  He stood there for a few minutes, waiting for any kind of sound, movement, voices, whatever. The last thing he wanted was to frighten a tweaked-out fiend in his own house. But he had to get Grady to erase that text message. It was the only way to ensure he wouldn't get caught up whatever mess they had gotten themselves into. He breathed in deeply and turned the knob and opened the door just a few inches. This door led to a bathroom on the right and a narrow hallway into the kitchen and living room.
  "Grady? Jenn? This is Will. You guys at home?"
  No answer. He waited a bit longer and then opened the door and went into the hallway. He crouched as he emerged.
  "This is Will. I just want to see if you guys are home."
  Slowly he rose. On the floor in the area leading to the bathroom a massive pile of clothes and spare engine parts was blocking his way. He crept around it and continued down the hallway. The hallway was dark, lined with picture frames of their family. Very old ones black and white ones of who he supposed were their parents in their high school days. Then a larger one, a Sears family portrait of Grady and Jenn with their two kids between them, dressed in their Sunday finest. Tasteful blue background. They looked much different then.
  As he came into the kitchen the smell of garbage overwhelmed his sense of smell. Something rotten. Trash overflowed from the can beside the oven onto the floor. The sink was filled with dirty dishes. The refrigerator door was partly opened, cool air leaking out. He passed the backdoor he had looked through earlier as he entered the living room. There was an ashtray on the coffee table, filled with ashes and a few broken glass pipes and cigarette butts. Next to it was the eight ball, opened.
  The front door was locked with a chain. The door to the master bedroom was on the other side of the living room. It was half closed. Nobody was here. He nearly sent a text to Grady but decided to check the last room, just in case they were passed out.
  "Grady? Jenn? This is Will. Just checking in on you guys. This is Will. Hello?"
  He walked to the door to the master bedroom and pushed it open. On the walls and on the dresser and the window against the wall he saw red splatter. So much of it. He stumbled backwards and pushed the doorknob through the cheap drywall. On the bed lay what remained of Grady and Jenn, but it was only from their clothes that he could identify them. Their bodies were mutilated beyond recognition, floating in a stagnant pool of their own blood. The fluids and viscera went up to the walls and even speckled the ceiling.
  He covered his mouth and went to the living room. He fell onto the couch and tried to keep from retching. The smell and the sight of the horror kept repeating in his brain. He took in deep breaths. But a few moments he rose and started to look around for the cell phone. He looked everywhere, on the end table, on the coffee table, on the chairs, between the cushions. In the kitchen. Nowhere. He stopped momentarily and looked deep in thought. In reality he was psyching himself for what he knew he had to do. He took a few more breaths and went back to the master bedroom. He covered his mouth as he tried to find the pockets in their clothes, also shredded to the point of un-recognition. He retched a few times but as he had not eaten since last night nothing came out. His hands were now stained red. Nothing found.
  At last he could take no more and ran out again and sat on the recliner facing the TV. He watched the loop of Dorothy walking the fence, Toto just behind, then the Tin Man dancing, then the Scarecrow doffing his hat, the Lion cowering, the entrance to the Emerald City, the  Wizard behind the curtain, a closeup of the ruby slippers. His cell phone vibrated in his front pocket and his heart felt like it was going to jump out of his mouth, "Jesus Christ Almighty, Fuck me in the Ass! Fuck you!"
  He took a few deep breaths and then reached in his pocket. He did not want to look at the phone. It was a text message, he knew that from the vibration. It could be anybody. It could be a customer. It could be Rodriguez. They were the ones who had this number. They were the only ones. He flipped over the phone. It was a text from Grady,
  
  We need the notebook you have. Please stay put
  
  He sat back down on the couch. He chewed his lip and then wondered why he was doing that. It was not something he normally did, chewing. He looked at his arms and legs and it was like he was looking at someone else. Then some thoughts started to come to the forefront of his mind. One was notebook, the word notebook for the computer. And the other was 'Please stay put'. It was very, polite. Respectful even. That did not reconcile with the image of Grady and Jenn in the master bedroom, an image he would never forget. But then, after he got over the seeming politeness of the request he started to think about what it implied. Did they know where he was? And then, how did they know?
  He went to the front window and peered out of the blinds. From  here you could see clear to the top of the hill, to the dirt road that went through the trailer park. And then he saw a car, an Oldsmobile from the eighties, Burgundy in color and boxy styled, zooming over the hill, spewing dust and rocks into the air.
  The back door flung open and he darted down the steps and ran as fast as he could into the woods. In this state of mind all he could remember was the general direction of where he parked, so that's where he went. He passed trees and kicked up leaves and was making so much noise that he was sure anyone who was listening could easily hear him. But still that seemed preferable to what would happen if they caught him.
  Now in the distance he heard voices, at the door. Talking to themselves, listening to hear what direction he was running. Then shouts. He kept running. He looked back for just a moment but when he turned back he was staring down a tree in his path. He had just enough time to swerve to the left but still his shoulder grazed the lowest hanging limb. The gun fell from his hand and vanished into a pile of dry leaves. He had no time to stop to recover it. He thought he heard besides his loud shuffling the sounds of others. Still he ran, zigging in this direction and zagging in the other. More shouting. How many were there? It sounded like a lot of them.
  Then he found the open area where his pickup was parked and jumped inside. He fumbled with the keys and started the engine. As he put the truck in gear he heard more shouting nearby. He spun the truck around in reverse and put it in drive a little too soon. He drove right into a drainage ditch and collided with the opposite wall. Immediately he flung the pickup in reverse and backed out. The wheels spun for a few seconds but then grabbed hold. He heard more shouts.
  He put it in drive one more time and sped towards the dirt road leading to the main road. He turned left down Price and continued as fast as he could to lose them in case they decided to follow, but not so fast as to attract the police.

  The setting sun glanced over the roof of the downtown library, casting long shadows over the cars in the parking lot. He pulled into a spot near the back. It was a hidden spot next to a paved trail that ran alongside the Etowah River. Too risky to park at the hotel. Maybe they had seen the truck during the escape. He took off down the trail. Oak leaves tumbled around his boots. A winter wind. The river was high. Muddy. It would be dark soon. That was what he wanted. He made his way underneath the overpass, winding to the south, to a rusted bridge unused since the new one opened up a few years ago. In fact it was blocked off by a barricade. He jumped the barricade and ran to the other side of the river. Then he walked a few blocks and crossed a few intersections until he was on the road behind the hotel, or what he thought was that road. He wasn't sure but kept going. When he arrived to the hotel he slowed down and walked casually up to his room and unlocked the door. 
  The room was ransacked. The mattress was flipped on its side next to the bed and shredded with a knife, stuffing hanging out. The dresser drawers were all pulled, his belongings strewn on the floor. Same in the kitchenette. Everything that could close was opened. Contents everywhere. Silverware, plates, leftover food, papers from his divorce, the restraining order. Everything. He went to the door and fastened the chain latch and turned the deadbolt. Not that it would do much good. On the back of the door in pink magic marker he read a message, possibly from some prostitute to another, *Don't forget to lock the door, honey!!!*, the dots on the exclamation points were smiley faces.
  He stood near the window and parted the curtains just enough to see into the parking lot. It was twilight and hard to make anything out, but headlights from the five o clock traffic gave him enough light to do a survey. There were late-model sedans, work trucks, a jeep, but near the back he saw a boxy-shaped vehicle and was reminded of the Oldsmobile from the trailer park. Not many of those on the road anymore. He saw smoke from the tailpipe and what he thought were two dark silhouettes inside. He stared at that car for a minute but saw no movement or indication they were watching his room. He closed the curtain. He sat down on the bed and nearly called the police but thought better of that. Instead he turned on the TV. He wanted to see the six news.
  
  "Top Story tonight. Police have confirmed two murdered bodies found in a Kingston trailer park to be the suspects in the break-in and fire which occurred at the research facility on the college campus last night. Police were notified of the bodies by an anonymous phone call this afternoon. The deceased have been identified as Grady and Jenn Upton of Kingston. Related, police have identified the body pulled from the remains of the research facility to be that of Zoey Jackson, a graduate student who was the only person on log to be inside the facility during the time of the break-in. Investigators have asked anyone who has information about the break-in or murders to please contact police headquarters with any information. We'll put a phone number on the screen below. Is it there? Good. Thanks Jim. Moving on, the Riverside Square and Folk Dance Festival is headed to Ridge Ferry park this weekend, and organizers want to know, Are you ready for the Hootenanny?"
  
  He sat on the bed. He couldn't breathe. It was supposed to be automatic but somewhere over the last few minutes his body had forgotten about that responsibility. He took some deep breaths in, but couldn't escape this feeling of suffocation, of drowning. He thought about the computer in the bin outside. He wondered if it were still there. As much as he'd like to forget all of this, he was in it, and the more info he had the more likely he would be to make it out alive. Just like a drug deal.
  He switched on the lamp and wiped his face with his hands. He thought deeply for several minutes, completely still. Then got up. First he went to the bathroom window and wedged the screwdriver where it couldn't be opened. He was sure if they were watching then they would be watching the alleyway behind this place. So it was off limits. He turned off the lamp so that it was completely dark in the room. He picked up the phone in the room and started to dial, but then the cell phone in his pocket vibrated. He put the phone back on the receiver and pulled the cell phone from his pocket.
  
  We need the notebook
 
  No response for a couple minutes. He was about to put the phone back in his pocket when another message arrived.
  
  Please stay put
  
  He tossed the phone on the bed and picked up the room phone. He dialed and closed his eyes, took a deep breath.
  "911, what is your emergency?"
  "Yes, there is a room fire at the Relax Inn on Martha Berry. The fire is at room 115 and its spreading fast. Please send firetrucks. There are injuries also."
  A moment later.
  "Okay sir, fire trucks are enroute to Relax Inn on Martha Berry. Can you tell me who is injured and what are their injuries? Please stay on the line with me as long as you can, until paramedics arrive on scene."
  He hung up.
  Minutes later he could hear the sirens coming down Martha Berry and then saw the red and white flashing lights reflecting off the fast food joint across the street. Then a firetruck and ambulance pulled into the hotel parking lot, followed by two police cars, red and blue lights flashing, reflecting off the rooms and the glass windows. People emerged with concerned faces. He waited for his chance. When enough firefighters and EMTs and police officers were deployed with their gear, when enough hotel occupants filled the parking lot, he made a dash for it.
  He opened the door to his room and crept along the walkway in the direction of the garbage bin at the end of the row. He reached the edge and went around the corner, in the dark, where he would not be seen. He rose and opened the sliding metal door of the bin. It had not been picked up but there was much more trash inside than earlier. It smelled bad. He took a breath and pulled himself up and disappeared into the bin.
  He fished in between the bags of trash and loose wet trash of mysterious origin and eventually found the computer. It was covered in some kind of slime he hoped hadn't corrupted the internals of the machine. But then he heard noises just outside and stopped.
  He listened and thought he heard shuffling on the ground around the bin, whispers, but he wasn't sure. If they were watching maybe they had seen him even in the confusion of his emergency distraction. He waited. There were two openings to the bin, one facing the parking lot, the one he had entered, and another facing the opposite way, towards the small pine trees behind the place. He picked up a large, heavy bag and positioned himself so that he could be facing the opening towards the parking lot with the other directly behind him.
  And then he heaved the large bag out the opening and it landed with a solid thud on the pavement. Immediately he saw two dark figures pounce on it from the side and without a moment of hesitation he jumped backwards and leapt out of the back opening and scrambled into the pack of pine trees up the hill. He heard them behind him and heard their shouts, even a shrill kind of shriek that filled him with primal dread. Whoever they were they were not just doing a job. They were filled with rage.
  He slipped on a slick bed of pine straws and felt a hand on his ankle grab hold. He kicked backwards with all his strength while simultaneously heaving upwards on his palms and elbows. He made contact and heard a groan and was on his feet.
  At the top of the hill he spotted a 24-hour lab and clinic and decided that may be the safest place to be at the moment. He tucked the computer under his arm and ran down the other side of the hill into the parking lot of the clinic. The parking lot was almost empty. The sign for the clinic was bright white and red and made him feel exposed. But there was the automatic door under the sign reading Immediate Care and he ran towards it.
  Across the marble floor of the lobby his dirty boots squeaked, echoing down the long hallways to his left and right. He had been here before years ago and knew the elevators were down the right hallway. He went that way. This late in the day there was nobody present, not even at the customer service desk. He ran to the elevators and found the door leading to the stairs. Up he went to the second floor and burst through the door. He wasn't sure how far they were behind but didn't want to take a chance.
  Upstairs were the offices for specialists, orthopedic, oncology, ENT, but also the radiology lab. There were a few workers in the hallway, wearing navy blue scrubs, carrying clipboards, pushing carts. People still waiting for test results. One old lady sat unattended in the hallway. She eyed him suspiciously as he brushed past. His frantic energy and disheveled appearance started to draw attention from the employees. They gave significant glances to one other. A receptionist in oncology reached for the phone. He heard the elevator ding and panicked. He darted into the nearest door.
  Once inside he closed the door and held it. The receptionist in the x-ray lab stood up, puzzled.
  "Sir, you can't close that door. It needs to remain open at all times."
  When he faced her she could see he was in no mood to argue. She picked up the phone, pushed a button, and spoke into it, never once breaking eye contact with him. He left the door and ran from the waiting area to the patient area, behind a large wooden door opened with a flat metal button at waist level.
  By now all the workers had been notified an erratic man was in side the building. They stood facing him, unmoving. He pushed through the doorway and went to the corner most room, the x-ray room. Here there was a machine with a platform base and two enormous arms. On the wall nearby was an observation window and a corner where the technician sat. He walked to the observation room. There was a older woman sitting at the computer. She looked up at him through reading glasses, a pen in her hand. Calmly she spoke to him, rising to her feet.
  "Sir, you won't get any drugs here. This is an x-ray lab. Are you sick? We can get you help."
  In his current state of mind it took him a few moments to register what the technician was telling him.
  "Give me your pen."
  "Sir?"
  "I said give me your pen. The one in your hand. I fucking need it. They are coming."
  "Sir, there is nobody here except us. Nobody is coming. I can't give you anything you might hurt yourself or others with. Why don't you follow me into the waiting room?"
  He exploded.
  "Give me the fucking pen you bitch!"
  He pried it from her hand and ran to the far corner of the room. She screamed and ducked under the desk in fear. Others entered the room. When they saw him with the pen they stopped.
  He set the computer on a counter, removed the cell phone from his pocket and found Grady's phone number in the menu using only his left hand. With his right he wrote the number on his arm. He then tossed the phone on the ground and picked up a metal container from the counter. He brought it down hard on the phone repeatedly, smashing it to bits.
  "Angie," one of the men shouted to the technician cowering under the desk, "Security is on the way. Don't worry. They'll be here soon."
  At that moment the man took a look at his surroundings. He saw the workers at the door, frightened but firm. He saw himself, brandishing the technician's pen like a madman. It was like he was in a movie, like he was watching a movie, removed from the danger or the implications of his actions. But at the same time he knew it was reality. At that moment he caught onto what the man had just said, *Security is on the way*, and understood that it wasn't to protect him from the dark figures who were chasing him. It was to protect all these innocent people from him.
  He then gripped the pen in one hand like a knife, tucked the computer under his other arm, and slashed at the air in front of him, rushing the crowd at the door. They ducked to the corners and he rushed through them into the hallway. He was sure security would be coming up the stairs and went to the platform which overlooked the lobby. It was a good twenty five foot drop.  He heard shouts from down the hallway, shut his eyes momentarily for strength, and heaved himself over the guard rail.
  He landed hard on the marble floor, his ankle twisted, and he collapsed into a ball. It hurt. Really bad. He was dazed but got up anyway and stumbled towards the entrance. Once outside he limped to the back of the facility, where there were no lights. Once in the dark he caught his breath and collected his thoughts and set off towards the library, cursing the stupidity of his injury and limping like a wounded animal.
  By the time he reached the library it was almost seven, which was when the library closed this day of the week. He was tired, sweaty despite the dropping temperature, and hurt. When he entered the library the woman at the front desk reminded him they would be closing soon. He nodded and smiled with as much normality as he could muster and went to the winding stairway that led to the second level where the fiction section was. Once at the top he went to the back, where there was a restroom. He knew this because he used to come here often to pick up books for Suzanne, who was a voracious reader, unlike him.
  In the restroom he washed his face in the sink, looked at himself in the mirror, took a few deep breaths, and then went into the furthest stall at the back. He set the computer on a diaper changing station in the stall and then climbed onto the seat of the toilet, wincing from the pain. And he waited.
  After some minutes, maybe half an hour, the door opened and a listless female voice shouted into the bathroom.
  "Anybody in here? We're closing now."
  The lights went out and then she was gone.
  He waited for another half hour, then got down. His legs were asleep and so he had to shake them for a few minutes. His hurt ankle was starting to swell. He went to the door and opened it just enough to be able to listen. He heard nothing. He came out and walked down the steps into the lobby. Though the main lights were out there were still random small lights on to see by. He walked through the periodicals, through the nonfiction sections, to the back of the building where the computers with internet access were. He walked rows and rows of old books and wondered how long some of them had sat there unread. The smell reminded him of summer days when his mother brought him here.
  When he reached the computer station he found a good spot with a table nearby and set to work. He connected the computer to a power outlet and turned it on. The familiar green login screen appeared, with the pre-filled username, z.jackson. He thought of the newscast he had seen earlier. The woman who had used this computer, which contained some extremely valuable information, was dead. The two fiends who had stolen this computer were also dead, mutilated in fact, and now he was being followed for this computer. He had to figure out how to get into it and learn why it was so valuable. That seemed to him the only way to understand how best to leverage his position. He was no fool.
  He switched on the terminal closest to him and when it booted he did a search on how to bypass the login screen on an Apple computer, crossing his fingers. He was not at all computer savvy but knew there were those out there who were, and he could follow directions as much as any red-blooded American. The very first result gave him what he needed. He rebooted the computer and hit command+r to enter Recovery Mode. Then he selected Utilities->Terminal and when the Terminal opened he typed *resetpassword*. This launched the Reset Password utility dialog where he was able to select the z.jackson account and change the password. He changed it to *370Price*, his old address and rebooted the machine. He was in.

  The user interface faded in and a row of application icons popped up from the bottom of the screen. But the most interesting thing was the desktop wallpaper. It seemed to be a faded polaroid taken at a child's birthday party, from the early 80s going by the hairstyles and the clothes they wore. In the middle of the photo was a little girl wearing a pink dress, sitting at a small table in front of a house. She was surrounded by her parents on either side and she was blowing out a candle, which was still lit in this photograph. All around the table were children, clapping their hands, and presumably parents of those children looking on, smiles on their faces.
  Not knowing where to begin he found a folder called Documents and started opening files at random, looking for any clue as to why the computer was so important.

Zoey, it has come to my attention that you have approached several lab subjects with an offer to participate in an unauthorized research project called Aura. I would like to understand the nature of this research, to review any and all documentation you have thus far, and most importantly to get an explanation why you felt no need to notify me or any other manager to get permission use these facilities for your own research (which I remind you belongs to the Andromeda Group, based on section 41-B of the employee contract). Please see me in my office when you arrive and bring along the requested documents. Also your work computer.

Thank you,

ShoelessJoel: I like red and t-shirts but I don't like red t-shirts.
PinkHatGirl: I’m guessing your name is Joe and you are currently sans podiatric apparel?
PinkHatGirl: nice, I like red though - I bet you’d look good in a red t
ShoelessJoel: sure??? but it's irrelevant....
PinkHatGirl: oh
PinkHatGirl: what is relevant?
ShoelessJoel: Well... why are you in this site?
ShoelessJoel: You don't look like you need a place like this to find people...
PinkHatGirl: for random sex of course
PinkHatGirl: jk!
ShoelessJoel: Ok... you got me there for a second!
PinkHatGirl: but I do need this place, I never meet cool guys
ShoelessJoel: So... what is it? Maybe you don't have any time to socialize in real life?
PinkHatGirl: do you know any?
ShoelessJoel: You're talking to the coolest guy in town!
PinkHatGirl: I thought I might be, the arm tattoo tipped me off
PinkHatGirl: are you kidding I work all the time
ShoelessJoel: If I sound dull it's just 'cause I had a long day at work today...
PinkHatGirl: what are you here for?
PinkHatGirl: oh, what do you do?
ShoelessJoel: I'm just getting my mind off suicidal thoughts...
ShoelessJoel: But I'm fine! talking to you makes it better.
PinkHatGirl: oh no, I hope you’re joking
ShoelessJoel: I work at a shoe factory.... putting pieces together...
ShoelessJoel: It's boring as hell but it pays my livin'
ShoelessJoel: How 'bout you?
PinkHatGirl: hmm
PinkHatGirl: any shoes I might recognize?
PinkHatGirl: I work in a research lab
ShoelessJoel: It's classified...
ShoelessJoel: Cool! Sounds way more interesting than my story
ShoelessJoel: What's it about?
PinkHatGirl: oh really? so is my work but I won’t tell if you won’t
ShoelessJoel: Ladies first! 😜
ShoelessJoel: The factory I work for makes bowling shoes... and tap dancing ones...  weird combo, I know...
PinkHatGirl: this is going to sound ridiculous but I swear it’s real, we’re doing research to experiment how to control software by thoughts
ShoelessJoel: Already?!
ShoelessJoel: Sounds like a sci-fi movie
PinkHatGirl: it’s an honest to goodness field, look up neuroimaging electrophysiology sometime
ShoelessJoel: You look very young... how old are you?
PinkHatGirl: I like bowling
PinkHatGirl: not sure about tapdancing
ShoelessJoel: I like neuroimaging neurophysuiiiology😜
PinkHatGirl: it’s on my profile, 28
PinkHatGirl: haha, it turns on all the boys
ShoelessJoel: Almost 30! You look 20!
PinkHatGirl: it really can be like sci fi
ShoelessJoel: I know... science nerds get us all the time... 🤓🤤
PinkHatGirl: I work on visualizing the neurological data, nevermind it gets dull
ShoelessJoel: Does it work?
ShoelessJoel: I mean... like... it seems like Bs but hey, it's the new age of civilization
PinkHatGirl: it does but not to the level you want, like we can hook up nodes to your head and place you in front of two buttons, red and blue, if you think hard about the blue button are able to see that and trigger the button click
PinkHatGirl: it’s not at all really but I know why you’d say that
ShoelessJoel: Think... hard... trigger... hmmm.. sex!
PinkHatGirl: the group I work for is sponsored by all the big companies, google, amazon, Apple, facebook
PinkHatGirl: not THERE yet I’m afraid!
ShoelessJoel: Heh...jk
PinkHatGirl: bit who knows, one day maybe
ShoelessJoel: But... I would think those companies would fight for it
PinkHatGirl: it’s a consortium, it’s like an open source thing
ShoelessJoel: Like to get the whole thing... sounds like someone will get a lot of money out of it
ShoelessJoel: Aha... open something...
PinkHatGirl: well, I think so too
ShoelessJoel: So.... do you get bored?
ShoelessJoel: Sounds interesting but tiring
PinkHatGirl: we even had the guy who used to be head of cia under president bush come by to see a demonstration
PinkHatGirl: not at all, I love it!
ShoelessJoel: Cia..... oh man... are you kidding me?!
PinkHatGirl: I even work weekends, hence lonely and surfing dating websites
PinkHatGirl: no I’m not, unfortunately
ShoelessJoel: Good for me!
PinkHatGirl: thank you 😊
ShoelessJoel: It sounds like a cool job...
PinkHatGirl: what do you do for fun?
ShoelessJoel: I talk to pretty ladies like you....
PinkHatGirl: it’s very cool, but way too bureaucratic for me
PinkHatGirl: and stuffy
PinkHatGirl: everyone is wearing khakis and blue button downs
ShoelessJoel: Aha... you need more action...
PinkHatGirl: I’m not that pretty!
ShoelessJoel: You are!
PinkHatGirl: thanks
ShoelessJoel: To me, you're gorgeous..m
PinkHatGirl: I do need more action, I want to dance
PinkHatGirl: do you like dancing?
ShoelessJoel: What are you doing tonight?
PinkHatGirl: I’m at the lab
ShoelessJoel: Let's go!
PinkHatGirl: can’t, waiting on test results to compile
PinkHatGirl: but maybe this weekend I could meet up somewhere
ShoelessJoel: Ehhm....
ShoelessJoel: Sure!
PinkHatGirl: for a drink or something, maybe first
PinkHatGirl: then we can talk about dancing
PinkHatGirl: for all I know you’re into square dancing
ShoelessJoel: Sounds good to me
PinkHatGirl: you did mention tap shoes
ShoelessJoel: I make them...not use them 😜
PinkHatGirl: cool, what’s your real name by the way?
ShoelessJoel: I like more electronic music...
ShoelessJoel: Joel.
PinkHatGirl: oh, EDM?
ShoelessJoel: Yours?
PinkHatGirl: I love that shit
PinkHatGirl: listening right now
ShoelessJoel: More like tramp...m
PinkHatGirl: I’m Zoey
PinkHatGirl: nice to meet you Joel
PinkHatGirl: tramp, I don’t know that
ShoelessJoel: Zoey! Good to meet you too.
PinkHatGirl: yes sir
PinkHatGirl: well I need to get going Joel
ShoelessJoel: You'll like it if you're into electronic sounds
ShoelessJoel: Alright Zoey
PinkHatGirl: if you want to text off this site, my number is 706-204-9224
ShoelessJoel: It was cool talking to you.
PinkHatGirl: ok, I’ll check it out
PinkHatGirl: you too!
ShoelessJoel: Sure thubg
ShoelessJoel: Thing
PinkHatGirl: can wait to hear more about your adventures in the shoe factory
PinkHatGirl: 😜
PinkHatGirl: bye!
ShoelessJoel: 😂😂😭😭😭
ShoelessJoel: Bye!

  It was after 1 am when he lifted his eyes from the screen and glanced at the clock on the wall. Outside the glass windows was the glow of amber pole lights and trash and leaves blowing down the sidewalk. He wiped his eyes and went to the water fountain nearby. He splashed some water on his face and then drank a cold sip. Then he walked to the window and looked out and began once again to contemplate the things he had been reading for the last several hours. It still made no sense to him. He still didn't understand what was so important about this computer or have any clue who was after him for it. He was not a computer guy. Understood almost nothing of what he was reading, but despite that he had managed to piece together the beginning of the story.
  Zoey Jackson had worked at this research facility for some private entity named the Andromeda Group, which according to the Wikipedia page he found was 'a consortium of technology giants working towards the future of human-computer interaction'. Zoey wrote software, manipulating image data read from the brain activity, the best he could understand it. She did not fit in here very well. In fact it doesn't seem she would ever have been hired here without her relationship to Richard Dewey, the Director. Even so, she had done something to piss everyone off, and was fired. The firing had everything to do with Project Aura, but what was that? He had gone through all the folders and files and nothing except for those few emails from Richard Dewey mentioned it. But this was her computer. Maybe the Aura Project was a red herring as to why these people were after the computer, but he didn't think so. Something about the email with those 'men in suits'. He had found plenty of power point and word documents, code files which made no sense to him but seemed related to the day to day work of the lab. Everything seemed very much on the up and up. He didn't know of course but it didn't seem right that this would be what they're after, futuristic as it all was to him, it was related to manipulating buttons and form entry with thoughts, just like she told the man in the chat.
  He paced up and down the corridors of books. He felt safe here for the time being. But he did not feel safe. He knew they would find him again. Maybe it would be for the best to get rid of this damn computer. Hide it somewhere, send them a text of the location, and walk away. He was reasonably sure that was an option. But, if he played his cards rights, if he was smart enough to figure out why this machine was so valuable, he might find leverage to turn this whole nightmare into something good for himself. Pay off Rodriguez for good, get a place, then maybe -- Once these thoughts had grabbed hold of his mind they crowded out anything else that spoke against it. And the other big question was who was after him. If he knew that too it could be leverage. Maybe they had money. Maybe they were the sort that wanted to avoid authorities at all costs. But he knew as much about them as he did about this computer. They were invisible.
  He stopped where he was, on the other side of the library, and ran back to the computer. He had remembered a moment from high school, to a computer class he had taken one semester. He had accidentally erased a report he was writing about the Etowah Indian Mounds field trip, but when he told his teacher in panic she smiles and told him there was probably a backup in the hidden files. Hidden files and folders which were not visible by default on the file system. You had to enter special commands or enable certain options to see them. And when she enabled it for him, he found the backup of his lost report. 
  At the computer he did a search how to see invisible files and folders on an Apple computer, and followed the step by step instructions to turn it on using Finder. And then started at the top-most directory he could find, from the Macintosh HD drive and went through them again, looking for anything he could have missed. After another couple hours of looking he found it.
  Buried inside the directory logs->old->backup he found a hidden folder called p.aura. He opened it and found dozens of files. At the top was a file called _log.txt. He opened that first.
  
Excerpt from _log.txt
  
The neanderthals who discovered fire would not have understood the complex chemical reactions which lead to combustion, but importantly that didn't prevent them from harnessing its power for the benefit of all humanity. - An Analysis of Anthropologic History

Confirmed: I walk through a corn field, somewhere in Ohio? Blue sky. Dried, yellow stalks. I am a child, can't see where I'm going. It's a maze. I'm not supposed to be here. I stumble into a spider web. I panic and fall to the ground and look at the spider in the center of the web. Its enormous. Beautiful patterns on its torso.

Confirmed: My sister and I walk up a large hill next to a road. The hill is covered with trees. We push up a small pink bike, with sparkly tassels, hers. At the top we both get on and ride down together. We go really fast! So much fun!

Confirmed: Sitting on my mother's lap, near a vanity a mirror, reflecting us. The room is yellow. She is reading a letter from my father, he left us. I ask her, 'Is our heart broken?'

Confirmed: At the back of a backyard is a fence. Beyond the fence is a field. A yellow horse grazes there. Named Dusty. She crawls through the fence wires one day, not supposed to go there. Horse chases her. She runs, terrified, to the woods beyond the field. Finds a lake.

Confirmed: At the skating rink, Girls Just Wanna Have Fun, the lights in a star pattern on the ceiling, mother working the concession stand, nacho cheese dip crusty on top, boy with spiked hair, she pinches his butt as he skates by. Eye contact.

Confirmed: A dog, a white house, a man in camo shorts grilling burgers with a beer in hand, a screened-in backporch, a small yard, torn badminton set, trash cans out by a chainlink fence. Rubbing the dogs belly. Sun setting behind the trees.
  
Modified the device harness to be more user friendly. Now the boys in the lab will never find it. I need more test subjects. Was unable to reach Shiela today.

I'm having a hard time thinking about my day to day work. It seems pointless compared to this. So dull. But I can't work on this project when they are around. Only weekends. But I have a codename for it. Aura. I like it. And it suits the experience. My subject, Shiela I'll call her here, is getting a little anxious with my experiments. It doesn't harm her but she says she doesn't like the idea of it. Today I let her try the device on me, since I wanted to experience it from the other side also. She got sick too and that's when she started to complain. After I took her to lunch at the Cracker Barrel and explained that eventually it will be a two-way thing, like a telephone call, and that it doesn't really make sense without that component. She saw through my pie-in-the-sky ruminations though. She said, 'The US military would think it makes sense'. I have been avoiding facing that conclusion, but she's right.
  
Eureka! Over the weekend I found a willing subject to help me test the device. She's an older lady who collects cans along the route I take to get here in the morning. I see her all the time. I stopped and offered her fifty dollars and McDonald's to let me run her through some tests in the lab and she agreed. Tests good so far. Doesn't use too much power. Was able to receive clear visualization and impressions. Subject reported no awareness when device was transmitting. After I became very sick. Need to keep a bucket nearby in the future. For this reason had to cut session short. But it works! But there is some secret sauce that happens once everything is in place that I can't yet explain. Yet. This is all exciting but a little scary too. I don't want to show anyone here in the lab. I don't feel like they'd understand what it needs to be. Maybe its just me.

I built something and need to test it out. Hence this log, to keep track of progress, because I can be a bit of an absent-minded professor, and I don't want to forget something important. So hello future Zoey! I got the idea on a Friday night, after an all-day coding session, writing a script to aggregate image data from the pipeline. We already have one, that Stephen wrote, but its buggy and slow. I fell asleep at my desk listening to Eno. And in my dream I saw this device, something like the node contraption we use on our human lab rats, but it worked in reverse, instead of reading and interpreting it projects and opens a channel to another brainwave. When I woke up I started to think about how to implement something like it. To capture and send a wireless transmission of the aggregated signal is nothing special. Off the shelf wireless transmitting technology can do it, coupled with the systems we already have in place. And custom software of course. But now I need to sleep...zzz

 This had to be it. He read in the log and started to get a picture of things, though still vague. There was a device apparently, but it was not in the bag. He checked the pockets again to make sure. There was a folder called videos filled with recordings of the test sessions, both subject and object, as they were labeled in the filename. He opened one and saw Zoey wearing a pink knit toboggan with little cat ears. She was staring straight ahead and looked something like a zombie, not completely there. A few minutes later she startled and immediately vomited into a bucket on the floor. And then broke into a giddy laugh and raised both arms in a gesture of triumph. He also found an executable file called simply aura and clicked on it. A dialog box popped up with the message,
 
Please connect device

  Then he slept. Two hours later the alarm he set went off and he packed the computer into its bag and walked outside through the emergency exit in the back. An alarm buzzed loudly inside the building, his heart jumped and he quickened his pace. It was cold and his breath visible in front of him. The tips of his ears stung by the time he reached the parking lot. He got in and let the truck run idle for a few minutes before driving off. Only after he turned onto Broad Street did he switch on the headlights. By now it was 5 am.
  He drove Highway 27 out of the city. There was no other traffic on the road but soon a semi came over the hill and blinded him with its high beams. He turned on his own high beams and flipped the driver off with a snarl.
  "Fuck you too buddy."
  He turned left at the Coca Cola Bottling Plant and passed a sign that read Riverside Industrial Park. Lucky for him several of the pole lights were busted. He switched off his headlights and drove in the dark, able to see dimly by the pale moon over the trees. He passed the Old Fashioned Bakery Distribution center and saw a line of white trucks, drivers sleeping in the seats. Nobody around to see him. Nobody who cared anyway.
  It was obvious he had reached the research facility when he saw the bands of yellow tape across the entranceway and all around the perimeter. He drove past and nearby found a small culdesac almost completely obscured by the woods. He pulled in and parked. He fished out a flashlight and put on the backpack with the computer and set off through the woods towards the facility.
  He brushed aside limbs only to have them lash back into his head and torso. He gazed up and saw the sky had become gray with morning and he knew he didn't have as much time as he would have liked. He figured the earliest any investigators would arrive would be after 9 but wanted to be long gone by then. With luck he would be.
  Soon he emerged from the woods and saw the vast black shape of  the facility looming overhead. Doors on every side were sealed with particle board, nailed around the edges. He would rather been have subtle about this but there was no time for that. He picked up a heavy log near the edge of the woods and heaved it through a un-barricaded window on the rear of the building. It shattered into large shards which fell inward.
  With two hands on the lip of the window he pulled himself up and through, brushing against the jagged edge of the window remains. It pierced his shoulder and he winced but didn't make a sound. He came down hard inside an office. This particular office was not damaged. He went into the hallway and saw things were similar here. No fire damage. No signs of an explosion. He entered the lobby and saw the fragments of glass from the front door glass Grady and Jenn had shattered on the night.
  Several times he stopped mid-walk and stopped breathing. He listened at those moments, wanting to make sure he was still alone in the building. He was keeping a mental map of his path through the darkness, in case he had to make a quick escape. The offices on this level were definitely management, bookkeeping, HR, and not the research teams he was searching for. There were steps leading to the second floor. Here he could see indications of the explosion, random debris, charred drywall, bits of concrete, the walls scorched in places, the paint bubbled, peeling in spots. He went up.
  On the second floor he saw more destruction. This had to be the origin of the explosion. The floor seemed to have been cubicles, decimated now, the walls blackened and scattered here and there. Flat panel monitors poked through the rubble of papers and concrete. He saw the remains of office chairs, whiteboards, picture frames of cute kids. He took a brief look into the next section and saw the lab. It had been a wide open area with stations with computers, destroyed now.
  This was ground zero. This must have been the place where Zoey had run the Aura experiments. If Grady and Jenn had stolen the computer from here, then the device had to be here too, if it were not destroyed. Which it likely was. But he found himself fed by a compulsion he could not really explain, risking being found here, risking being discovered by those dark figures. It seemed worth it to him. He rummaged through the ruins, looking for any sign of Zoey's cubicle. Once he found the proximity of her desk he knew he would find more. 
  One small but important detail he had noticed in the videos he watched. They were not recorded in the lab. They were definitely at her cubicle. He even remembered the number, 21, visible on a plastic card in the background. He looked for anything.
  Outside the sun was shining through the trees, the sky an gray-orange color. Unfortunately he didn't have his phone to see the time, but he knew it was something like 6:30 am. 
  He was rummaging through a pile of rubble when he found a curious picture frame. The picture inside was burned but he could make out what it used to be. It was the same photo as the background of Zoey's computer. The old, faded polaroid of a birthday party in front of a house. He had found her cubicle. With this he quickened his pace, throwing boards and pieces of char through the air, looking for anything like the device. It seemed hopeless. Nothing he found seemed related to a device or Project Aura, or anything else of note. He found pens, staplers, a calendar of kittens, with no information of course. He found bent and burned remains of a small file cabinet. The door to it was locked but he was able to pry it open.
  The first thing that caught his eye was the pink hat with kitten ears, the same one he had seen Zoey wearing in the videos. So this was her cubicle after all. He went through the rest of the contents, cups of ramen, packets of chai, an empty binder, an instruction manual to a printer. Nothing that resembled a device. And that was it. He kept going through the rubble but found nothing of interest. He did find some cables and grew hopeful but it turned out to be for a monitor.
  By now it was past seven. Maybe even closer to eight. He knew there could be investigators, police showing up anytime. So he stopped, reluctantly, and headed downstairs. When he entered the lobby, however, he noticed something he hadn't seen before. There on the wall was a photograph of everyone, he assumed. They were standing outside the facility, on a sunny day, squinting a a crowd. All wearing the same blue Andromeda Group t-shirt. Everyone wore the t-shirt except for the girl in the back. She had on an army jacket, jeans, and a knitted pink hat with kitten ears. He looked at her face, bored, aloof, even contemptuous. And then something from the log file came back to him, "I hid the device somewhere the boys in the office will never find it." There were several women in this group photo. So her saying "boys" in that way seemed significant all of a sudden.
  Back upstairs the sun was coming into the large window towards the rear of the building. He went directly to the spot where he had found the cabinet and fished out the pink hat. It was dirty but unharmed in the explosion. Being in the cabinet had surely saved it. He folded it inside out and saw a multitude of wires and nodes.
  
  He started the pickup and let it warm up. Then he pulled out of the culdesac and left the industrial park from the other side, out Eden Valley road. It was that time of the morning, commuter traffic. He passed cars and got caught behind a school bus. He grew impatient and zoomed around the other cars, nearly ran over a pack of school kids.
  Once over the mountain he got back on the main road, headed back into town. He couldn't avoid the traffic here so just rode it out. In his mind he made plans to get another place, a hotel he knew up in Adairsville. Nobody would find him there. Then he'd have all the time he needed to examine the device and see if it still worked, and hopefully figure out how much it was worth to those guys.
  As he worked it all out he saw a car coming up on his rear. It was an old Buick, boxy-shaped. He tensed up on the steering wheel and watched them out his rearview mirror. One of the men leaned out the window and pointed a gun. It happened so fast it was like a dream. He swerved into the other lane as the shot went off. But of course the Buick just got behind him again.
  He floored the old 350 engine and his truck pulled ahead. He weaved around several cars, attempting to get out of the line of sight. One car honked at him for the reckless driving and he honked right back at them.
  Not having much time to think he just kept driving, staying on the main road. His hope was maybe a patrol car would be watching from the median. If he saw one he'd stop and get help. But he saw nothing. The Buick was approaching fast, weaving in and out of the other cars on the road like they were utterly still. As they came around a curve where the road split, one going up 411 towards Cartersville, the other into the city proper, he swerved  at the last minute and took 411. A nearby SUV honked furiously as it had to slow down to let him over. The Buick saw too late and slammed on its brakes, but there was too much traffic for it to take the turn. It kept going.
  He took 411 to the bypass to the bypass and turned left, driving past the car dealerships and the minor league baseball stadium. This would lead him into town the back way. He turned near the Board of Education offices, through an old mill village where all the houses were made of red brick. But as he went through a little roundabout he saw the same Buick appear from the other side. It swerved in front of another car, which had to stop completely, and came up on him going at least fifty.
  "Jesus Christ!"
  He hammered on the gas and a block later went over a speed bump at a crosswalk too fast. The bounce jolted him out of his seat and his head hit the roof of the car, his vision flashed. the backpack with the computer and device landed on the floorboard. But he kept going. He looked behind and saw the Buick slow down to avoid the bump. But immediately speed up.
  Nearby there was a small park with a baseball field. He used to hang out at this park with his friends when he was a teenager so he knew there was a way out of the subdivision behind that park and figured he could make it in his pickup through the park and up the small hill whereas that old Buick might not. So without much hesitation he swerved to the right and went down the grass slope into the park, tearing up clods of mud and blowing leaves into the air. He went through the swing sets and the seats and chain banged against the windshield but did not crack it. In the rearview he didn't see the Buick at all and kept going until he reached the small hill where the small road joined. The pickup swerved up the hill and he nearly lost traction in the mud, but he had enough acceleration and came down over the curb onto the road. Nobody followed him. The road in front of him and behind him was empty. Quiet. He drove the speed limit, hearing bits of mud rattle in the wheel well as they spun from the tires. He let out a breath and tried to think things through.
  The plan now was to get somewhere safe and take a closer look at this device, make sure its still working properly. Then if it was working, he'd buy a burner from Walmart and text Grady's number to see if they wanted to make a deal. And they'd sure as shit have to pay.
  He wondered how exactly they were able to track him down this time and the only thing he could figure was they had marked his pickup somehow. He guessed it wouldn't be that hard, assuming you had the manpower to post lookouts on the roads into and out of the city. This rusted piece of shit was distinct enough. The thought made him nervous. He had to ditch it.
  Turning onto North Broad he went down a dilapidated section of town. In the parking lot of a Baptist church with large slate panels he parked, near the back, behind the air conditioner units and not visible from the road. He grabbed the backpack from the floorboard and stuffed the flashlight in his pocket, as well as a pair of work gloves, and then hoofed it up a hill to the neighborhood which ran parallel to the main road.
  Low gray clouds moved overhead, a chilly wind blew through the limbs of the oak trees which grew between the homes here. He put on the backpack and buttoned his jacked, stuffing his hands in the pockets and made his way through the neighborhood's back roads in the general direction of downtown. There was another hotel he knew of, cheap weekly rates. He could hole up there for awhile. He had cash enough for that. Then there was the problem of a vehicle, but he would think about that later.
  His ears and nose and lips started to freeze. His eyes watered. He could even feel the cold seeping through his jeans. He removed his hands from his pockets and rubbed the extremities but the warmth was only temporary. He was also hungry. Tired. Despite this he picked up the pace. He had never been on these roads or even in this neighborhood but knew it had to join up with Turner McCall at some point. He could walk behind the businesses and hotels until he was in a safer area.
  Half an hour later he was surrounded by the smells of fast food joints, piping the smells out of vents to lure customers. Smells of burgers, fried chicken, barbecue. His stomach twisted and he felt a burning sensation. He spotted a local coffee shop and decided to duck in. They were well known for good coffee and damn good country ham biscuits. He walked up, turned to make sure nobody was looking at him, no boxy Buicks, and went inside.
  This time of day was the time when all the college students came here before class, studying, talking. Hung on the walls were bad pencil drawings of celebrities, bright, colorful folk art in shapes like fish, cows, farm equipment. In the back was a vintage coffee bean roaster. The music they played inside was classic Americana, Elvis, Buddy Holly, Roy Orbison. He wandered to the counter, looking for a good, hidden place to sit. The place was full of patrons.
  "What can I get for you today, sir?"
  He turned to face the woman at the register, her bright purple hair done up in a bun, smiling at him.
  "Coffee with milk,"
  But then he noticed her smile turn into wide-eyed horror. She screamed and ducked. He had just enough time to turn and see two figures, dressed in dark coats, standing in the doorway, guns drawn and pointed in his direction. He ran for the other side of the shop, to the other entrance, ducking behind a table. By now everyone in the place had seen the two men with guns and started screaming, some running for the exit, some hiding under the tables. Shots rang out. Wood splintered on the table near him. He heard shouting and took the chance to run for the door. 
  He was outside. The backpack slowed him down somewhat, its weight moving against his stride, but he pumped his feet as fast as possible and turned the corner and ran up some stone steps to a row of lawyer's offices. Behind him he heard shots and screams, running on the sidewalk. He didn't look back. Beyond the row of offices was a chainlink fence. He hopped that and found himself in a leaf-strewn alley behind several buildings. Between them he found three or four large city-provided garbage cans with yellow lids. He lifted one of the lids and smelled the sour, rotten garbage inside. He quickly reached in and tossed the bags into both the other bins until it was empty, and then got inside. The backpack snagged on the lip so he quickly removed it and held it between his legs. He closed the lid. He waited, breathing in the smell, wanting to throw up from the smell, hoping they would not find him.
  From inside the can he could hear nothing, only traffic sounds distant, a squirrel running through the leaves. There were no more shouts or gunfire. No heavy footsteps in this direction. The air inside was suffocating, several times he retched uncontrollably but still waited. It might have been half an hour later when he emerged, lifting the lid slowly, breathing in the clean air. He got out.
  He walked to a place where he could see the parking lot next to the coffee shop. Several police cars were there, blue lights flashing, an ambulance. People standing around, looking concerned. Cars pulling in and out, taking photos. He turned and walked the other way, keeping behind the buildings, hoping nobody would spot him that could recognize him from the coffee shop. He walked until he came to the river, the same path he had taken the previous day from the library. He walked the path beside the river until he was near downtown. There was a small open area where the city's pontoon boat was moored. He sat down on the bench here and waited longer, collecting his thoughts. Once again the smell of food filled his nostrils and his stomach lurched. There was a Waffle House up on the hill. He talked himself into attempting it, his reason being the all-glass front of the Waffle House would make it difficult for his pursuers to sneak up on him, and that he knew the layout of the back kitchen of these places, had a buddy that used to work there, and knew he could easily escape out the back if it came down to it. Even if that was all bullshit he was telling to convince himself, he needed food.
  Towards the back he found an empty booth and sat facing the door. A waitress came by a couple minutes later and set down a coffee with milk. He said thank you and then asked her for something to eat.
  "Pecan waffle and a side of bacon."
  "You got it, hon."
  He drank the coffee and when the food came he scarfed it down quickly, and ordered seconds. Then scarfed those down. He felt much better after eating, felt his mind getting clearer. For the first time in awhile he started to relax. Maybe the event at the coffee shop had scared those guys off. With the police getting involved. He thought about getting out there again, walking to the extended stay, but it felt good to sit here, in the warmth, with a full belly.
  Instead he unzipped the backpack and pulled out the computer. He set it on the table in front of him and turned it on. Then he pulled out the knitted pink hat, the device, and found the black USB cable which came out the back of it, and plugged it in. It occurred to him then this was something like a moment of truth and he tensed up. He found the directory p.aura just like before and started up the program. It took a few seconds but then a dialog with a progress bar appeared and a few seconds after that it was complete and the application window appeared. At the bottom of the window was a small indicator with a message in green letters,

Device is Ready

  The inside of the pink knitted hat was covered with black wires and nodes which were made of a sponge-like padding. To him the device looked dangerous yet even so he hesitated only a moment before placing the hat on his head and pulling the sides down around his ears. Then he saw and heard and even felt things that no human being was ever meant to experience.
	  To him it was like being transported to the bottom of the ocean. He was on the floor of some undisturbed plain submerged in a viscous fluid. Yet he was also still in the booth in the Waffle House, he was still sitting down, or maybe he wasn't in the Waffle House at all. It was hard to tell. At first he could see nothing. Everything was dark, even sound had gone silent. But very slowly, extremely slowly it was not dark anymore. But was not light either. And the sounds returned but very far away, really as if he were at the bottom of the ocean and listening to conversations miles above. He could not recognize his surroundings. Perhaps he was somewhere else. It could be the ocean of another planet, one of the planets of Jupiter maybe. That was as reasonable as anything else. As his vision became accustomed to the fluid he saw shapes coming into and going out of focus. The shapes themselves wavered, as if they were also made of this same viscous fluid. It was all the same somehow. He looked down at his arms and saw two dark and unfamiliar shapes that could have been his arms, might have been, but he didn't recognize them as his own limbs. They did not seem to belong to him at all and moved of their own accord, imperceptibly slow.
  He was not afraid. Nothing about it made him afraid. In fact there was a part of him, somewhere in his brain, that might have even recognized this place. It felt familiar though completely alien to his forty years on Earth. Time passed. Or maybe it didn't. That too seemed connected to the viscosity of everything else. The only indication he had that things were changing was that his eyes were becoming more and more accustomed to this way of seeing. It was getting brighter but with no discernible source of light. The dark amoeba-like shapes around him began to take on more solid form. The sounds which had been miles away were closer now. Not very close and still the effect was like listening to something underwater, but they grew louder and louder. So time was passing though very slowly. As the shapes came into focus he began to imagine what sort of creatures they might become when they did fully form. Imagine if he had been taken to some strange planet. But even fearful thoughts like this were automatic and he did not take them seriously.
  Hours passed. He never became tired or irritable. Never needed to use the bathroom. He was completely at ease just to observe his surroundings. By now he knew where he was. Still in the booth at the Waffle House. He had been all along. The dark shapes he saw floating in the fluid were patrons, the waitress approaching him with a pot of coffee, the line cook flipping a patty melt. By now the light was nearly back to normal, though dimmed, much like the light during a solar eclipse. The sounds too were back to normal with just a bit of reverberation. But the strange thing was that time had not yet caught up to the light and the sound.
  The waitress he had recognized, his waitress, bringing the pot of coffee, had been walking towards him now for hours. The line cook had been flipping the same patty melt for the same duration. Time itself was viscous but just like his eyes and ears had become accustomed to the change so too was his experience of time catching up though it was taking much longer. An overweight woman sitting with two other women two booths in front of him had been sinking her teeth into the same cheeseburger the whole time. It was fascinating to watch. Time was passing so if he watched a particular place for awhile he could see minute changes. The look in the woman's eyes kept grabbing his attention. He thought she was about to break into a laugh the way her eyes were squinting, cheeks rising. His waitress, whose name was Ann as he could read on her name tag, had tired, forlorn eyes. Her mind was elsewhere. This was the face he kept returning to. Everyone else he observed seemed in this moment, except for Ann.
  Funny things started to happen once time had caught up to his normal experience. The dimness never went away and the sounds still came from underwater, but just as time seemed to catch back up, he started noticing the people in the Waffle House. They looked different. He hadn't noticed exactly when it happened. At first he thought maybe the light was changing yet again. But no. The best way he could make sense of it was that the people, and just the people, were more transparent than they had been before. Transparent wasn't the right word. He couldn't see through their bodies in any way. He thought maybe the word he was looking for was dimension. They were more dimensional than before. He could see further into them. Further than three dimensions anyway. But only when he focused and _really_ looked at them.
  What did he see when he looked at Ann? He saw that her mind was on her husband, who had recently been diagnosed with early-stage dementia. He also had a history of gambling and used to make trips to Pearl River Casino and lie about it, telling his wife they were business trips. So he had went through all their savings, took out second and third mortgages, and accrued hundreds of thousands dollars of debt, just when they were both about to retire. So she had to get work. She worked for the state for thirty years but they wouldn't hire her now due to cutbacks. So she took this job waitressing, just to make enough money to pay their mortgages and now the doctors say he'll only get worse and worse and she'll end up taking care of him one day as if he were just a baby and then he'll die and she'll be alone for the rest of her life.
  "Let me fill that up for you, hon."
  She filled his coffee. He looked at her, rubbing his eyes. She caught his eyes and grinned.
  "I sure do like that hat."
  His eyes went to the woman who was biting into her cheeseburger. She was laughing now, the woman sitting next to her was pointing at him, at the pink hat he wore, and they both sniggered and tried to hide the fact when they saw him staring.
  At the bar he saw a character. A young man, fat and balding but whose curly hair went around his crown like a doughnut. Something repulsive about him. He was shoveling in a western omelette with sausage links and coffee. He sat alone, slouched over his plate, frowning. As he looked closer he could tell the man was counting money. Six hundred from yesterday plus the thousand from this weekend, added with what they had already saved made just about ten thousand. He found if he looked closer he could learn more about the man, from the thoughts he could go deeper and explore the memories those thoughts were connected to. Jody, his name. And then saw a young Latina woman, pregnant. She had a bruised face, bruised back where he had beaten her many times. But why? Because he forced her to have sex with strange men in a nearby motel. He had brought her to the United States, promising a future life, a husband, children. Lies he told her. But he was making a lot of money. Planning to move to Florida. Buy a fishing boat, start a business. He was very close to having enough for the down payments but was concerned, afraid even, of getting caught. He wouldn't be able to handle prison. He had started to take Xanax to deal with the stress of dealing with her. Bitch that she was. Ungrateful for the life he was planning for them both. Why was she putting him through this stress? He looked closer and saw the room numbers, 104 and 110. 104 is where they met with the johns. 110 was where they stayed and where the money was, hidden in a gash in the bottom of the mattress.
    At that moment the young man pulled a cell phone from his jacket pocket and looked at a text message. Then he stood and went to the register, paid for his food, and burped as he stood there waiting to sign the receipt. Then he walked out the exit.
    He pulled the device from his head and immediately felt vertigo, like he were falling off a tall building. He caught himself on the table and booth and yelled in a panic. Everyone turned around. But their looks went unnoticed because he next felt an intense wave of nausea come over him. He nearly vomited on the table but managed to hold it in and ran into the bathrooms and collapsed over a toilet just in time. His entire breakfast came up. When he stood he felt dizzy and heavy-headed. He went back to his booth and saw the young man outside, waiting for the light to cross the street. He quickly stuffed the computer and device into the backpack and stumbled through the exit to follow him.
His skin pale, clammy, his stomach weak, several times he had to stop and place both hands on his knees and nearly vomited on the sidewalk, drooling from his mouth onto his boots. His vision was still blurry so he was glad to at least know where Jody was headed. He even knew what room number. Still, he wanted to keep close if only to verify that the things he had seen were true. He waited for the light to change for pedestrian traffic and then crossed to the other side. Jody was straight ahead, nobody else on the sidewalk but he was far enough away that he would never suspect anything even if he did turn around. They arrived at the Super 8 and he held back, walking the perimeter to find a spot where he could stake out the rooms without being seen.
  He found a wooden fence separating this parking lot from the one just over, another hotel and a spot where one of the boards had come loose. He ducked between it and crouched. From here he could see room 110 and part of 104. At the moment the door to 110 was partway open. In a few minutes Jody emerged and stood outside the door, one leg propped up on the wall. He pulled a vape pen from his pocket and held it up to his mouth, concealed. Massive clouds of vapor billowed into the parking lot. A few minutes after that he saw a young Latina woman wearing tight jean shorts and a white tank top walk from room 104. When Jody saw her he straightened up and stood by looking around as she walked inside 110. He followed her inside and slammed the door.
  He had seen a few things. One thing he had seen was that Jody, being paranoid, had left an extra room key stuffed inside the gap in the door trim, at the top. This was in case he was out and the woman needed to get out of 104 for any reason. That was the protocol. Only business in 104. No lingering there. The other thing was that tonight was the night when he hung out with some of his other friends, down at the pool hall, for beers and to watch the game.
  Around 3pm a Ford Mustang pulled up and honked twice. A minute later Jody emerged, wearing a bright yellow jersey, but instead of numbers it had a frightening clown face. His face also was painted black and yellow, also like a clown. He got into the car and it whipped around in reverse and peeled out of the parking lot.
  He waited a little while longer and approached room 110. In his hand he carried a brick he found near the fence, just in case he needed to defend himself. Above the door he found the extra key card and put it into the slot. The light turned green and he flung the door open, remaining outside in case the woman had a weapon. Nothing. He went into the room and shut the door. Nobody was there, but the door to the bathroom was closed. The room was a disaster. Clothes were scattered everywhere, hanging on the dresser, on the mirror, black lace bras and panties, a faux leather skirt, shorts, shoes in the corner. A carton of condoms and tissue boxes on the nightstand. Empty two liter bottles of Faygo soda in an overflowing trash can, pizza boxes stuffed behind it. 
  From the things he had seen before he knew exactly where to look for the money. With both hands he flipped the large mattress on its side on the floor beside the bed. The gash was there. He reached in a pulled out several dollar rolls. There were ten total so he figured a thousand in each. He stuffed them into the backpack slung it across his shoulder. But as he began to walk out again he looked back at the bathroom door and saw that it was now cracked open, a single eye peering out.
  He approached the door.
  "I'm not going to hurt you."
  The door shut as he came closer and he heard noises inside. When he reached the door he placed his hand on the knob and twisted. It was not locked.
  Inside on the tile floor, he saw the Latina woman, unclothed, her arms twisted up behind her back, handcuffed to an exposed pipe under the sink. She was not facing him, her back was bruised purple and green, but when she heard the door open she twisted her neck around and when she saw it was a stranger she started screaming. Then a small child, a girl, ran up to her and put her arm around the woman's neck and eyed him as if she were her protector, warning him to be careful.
  He backed away. The girl also had bruises on her arms and cheek. Her hair was unwashed. Clothes covered in old food stains.
  "My mom is hurt."
  He said nothing.
  "She needs a doctor. Are you a doctor?"
  "No."
  "Then you can't help her."
  She let go of her mother and reached out and shut the door on him. He stood for a few moments and then went to the door to the parking lot. He took one more glance around the room and walked outside.
  Jody stood there. He was much taller and stared down at him, his eyes narrowed, his expression hard, still in the clown makeup. He felt something on his chest, the point of a knife.
  "Get inside."
  The blade dug into his chest.
  He inched backwards into the room. Jody followed and shut the door behind them. The knife continued to press him back until his legs hit the edge of the bed and he sat down on it. Jody stood over him, looking at him. Then Jody went to the mattress and stuck his hand into the gash. He pulled out nothing and suddenly flew at him.
  "Where the fuck is my money you goddamn thief? You piece of human shit! You fuck!"
  Jody kicked him hard in the shins. And then stomped around the room, fuming, his chest expanding, arms flexing as if he were ready to explode.
  "In my backpack."
  Jody snatched the backpack off his shoulders and rummaged through it. He dumped the computer, the device, everything onto the box spring. The rolls of money came out too, bounced. He picked up the rolls one by one and counted them.
  Jody had stopped fuming and now just stared at him.
  At that point the door to the bathroom opened and the girl ran out. Everyone turned to her.
  "Daddy, momma's hurt. She told me she needs a doctor."
  Jody frowned at her.
  "Go back to the bathroom, sweetie. Daddy's working."
  The girl returned to the bathroom, looking from her father to the man on the bed to the mattress on its side. She closed the door once inside again.
  "Let me tell you why you're gonna give me that ten thousand."
  Jody leaned in close to him and looked curious.
  "Why?"
  The man looked at him.
  "Because you don't want anybody to know about your business in this room and room 104. That would be very bad for you."
  Jody stood up again, eyes widening.
  "Because I need money. I got debts. So the deal is you give me that money, and I walk away forever. And nobody finds out about your business here."
  Jody nodded and pulled out his knife.
  "There's another option, can you guess what that would be?"
  "You could kill me and dump the body in the river, or somewhere hidden."
  "That would be a hell of a lot better deal for me."
  The man stared.
  "Sure would be. But you won't do that."
  "Why not?"
  "Because you're a coward."
  Jody rushed in again and got right in his face. He held the knife to his neck, the blade on his jugular.
  "You frontin, motherfucker? You ain't go no idea what I'm about! Ask my boy Trey, ask Dave Wallace. You think you hard?"
  He stared Jody in the eye and saw all the same things he had seen in him earlier, in the Waffle House. Then he closed his eyes and imagined that he would die at this moment and discovered that he truly did not care. He let go of all the waste his life had become, of the things he had held out hope for, to get back again. And it was freeing. A sense of freedom was in that. So he embraced it. And it really was a shock to him when Jody folded and handed him the ten thousand and gave him back his bag and the computer and device. And he was in a sort of unreal state of not being fully present when he back out of the door into the parking lot and walked onto the sidewalk beside the traffic. He only felt himself again after walking a few blocks and started to think about the money in the backpack and that he should pay off Rodriguez in Kennesaw as soon as he could but that he needed a car to do that.

  Along the sidewalk beside Shorter Avenue he went, unsure where he was going or what he was looking for exactly. Yet something like a plan was slowly growing in his mind. He had ten thousand, which was about half of what he owed to Rodriguez. This would buy him time no doubt but he would still be in debt. Yet when it had occurred to him that he needed a car to get to Kennesaw where Rodriguez did business, it also occurred to him that if he were to hijack a car worth some money, drive it there, and hand the keys along with the cash to Rodriguez, that might be enough to clear his debts. There were some details to work out, but the important thing was he knew Rodriguez and his crew were known to deal with lifted vehicles, from time to time. And if not, at least he would know where it could be unloaded without drawing suspicion and before the police in that area were looking for a vehicle with that description. The only thing was he had to get out of the city without drawing attention. Assuming he took the backroads into Kingston, he could reach Cartersville, then 75 without even seeing any cops. That it was close to five worked in his benefit, since there would be a lot of traffic on the roads for distraction.
  He crossed the road, stopping in the turning lane to wait for a break in the line of cars. When he reached the other side he went into a Tom Thumb and got a coffee, hot dog, and a pac of Marlboro Lights. He hadn't smoked in hours and was feeling the jitters all of a sudden. As he stood around back of the gas station he saw a gravel parking lot full of cars. Most of them old pickups, old sedans, but there was one that stood out. It looked like a brand new Toyota Tacoma pickup, 4x4, red metallic paint. That truck is worth at least thirty thousand, he thought, and imagined the respect he'd get from Rodriguez if he handed over the keys to that bad boy, along with the ten thousand in cash. After he finished his coffee and hot dog, he smoked while he scoped out the area.
  The parking lot adjoined a garage for big trucks, a big blue building with a huge sliding door for an entrance. From here he could see all of them inside, one leaning over the engine bay of some school bus, one wrenching underneath a cabover, the others on break outside, smoking, bullshitting. One guy remained in the office but came out eventually and hollered for one of the mechanics.
  He stubbed out his cigarette and walked over to a hidden spot underneath a tree with some bushes. He knelt low and hooked up the device to the computer. It occurred to him that he might be able to leave the computer on in the bag, with the USB cable connected to the device. This would allow him to wear the device while the software was running on the computer in the backpack on his back. He changed the setting that turned the computer off when the clamshell was closed. He then started up the program and put on the device.
  Once again he was transported to the bottom of the ocean but it seemed less intense this time - the visual, auditory, and time drag, all took less time to return to normal. It felt to him like his body was becoming accustomed to the weird transition. So again he found himself looking out at a dim world where things were nearly the same but not quite. He looked at the mechanics in the shop and saw they also had that same kind of extra dimensionality as those people in the Waffle House.
  One by one he looked closer at them, this time concentrating on the thing he wanted to know. Which car was theirs, where were the keys, and were there any hidden in the cars themselves, to make his plan easier to pull off. And he found that he could see that information. _Seeing_ was the wrong word but there is no word for the exact experience, though _knowing_ might be closer. 
  The mechanics drove the cars and trucks he was not interested in. But the manager, the pencil pusher who stayed in the wood-paneled office most of the time, when he came out and he focused on him, he saw the whole thing. First laying eyes on it at dealership on a Sunday evening, going for a test drive that next day, talking to the credit union about a loan, getting fucked over on the trade-in for the his old Mitsubishi Montero Sport, but doing it anyway because he was so excited, signing the paperwork and driving off with it that same day. He saw him wash and wax it and wipe it dry with a microfiber cloth. And then he saw him buy a magnetic key holder and put the spare inside it, and then place the holder under the passenger wheel well, on the frame, hidden from all thieves.
  He removed the device and once again felt the nausea, enough to make him vomit up the hot dog and coffee from earlier, but again not quite as intense as before. And he guessed the more he used it the less nauseous he would be after, until he was no longer nauseous at all. Recovered, he placed the device in the backpack and waited until everyone in the garage seemed occupied. When they were he crept across the road and knelt inside a drainage ditch. Then on hands and knees he crawled to the passenger side of the Tacoma and slid as much under the truck as he could get. Then he fished in the wheel well for the key holder and after a few blind grabs he found it and pulled it  loose. He removed the key and tossed the holder on the ground, then slid out the other side and stood up.
  Two hands grabbed him around the shoulder and slammed him into the ground.
  "What the fuck do you think you're doing, buddy?"
  A kick hit him in the ribs and he doubled over, groaning involuntarily.
  "That's my truck asshole! You messed with the wrong guy this time."
  Another kick. Then there were voices.
  "What's going on, James?"
  "Caught this sonofabitch trying to steal my Tacoma."
  "Let's call the cops on his ass!"
  "Hey man, you got like since two seconds ago to get the fuck outta here or we're calling the cops!"
  One more kick into his side, as he stood up. He fell against the door of the Tacoma.
  "Off the truck!"
  The man named James grabbed his hand and twisted it hard until he felt his wrist was about to break, and he collapsed to the ground again, but quickly got to his feet and stumbled off, into the ditch. He felt a fist come down hard on his left cheek and saw a flash of light and then black as his head hit the grass. Another kick and then the voices were further away.
  "We'll be keeping an eye on you. Don't be showing your ass around here no more!"
  They were gone. He limped to the place behind the Tom Thumb, where he had eaten his food and drank his coffee and smoked. He collapsed agains the brick wall and sat there for some time, wincing from the pain. He was sure he had a broken rib. After awhile he went inside and went to the bathroom and washed his face. Already his wrist was beginning to swell and it hurt when he twisted his back. He went outside, the store clerk eyeing him suspiciously as he winced out the door.
  He kept walking the sidewalk. Inside he was furious. At himself. At those mechanics. Especially the one. James. He imagined stabbing him in the eye with a fork and pulling out the fork with the eyeball impaled on it and then shoving it down his fucking throat until he choked on it. He wanted to fucking kill him and then keep on killing him until there was nothing left of him to kill. 
  He found himself in another parking lot, walking on gravel. He was walking through a storage facility. He saw a sign, U-Stor-It. Rows and rows of of white buildings with sliding doors, padlocked. He walked through them, not seeing anything really, still enraged. But then his eyes caught something in the corner of the place, near the chainlink fence at the edge of the property. An old Chevrolet Citation, green, covered with leaves and pollen dust, a tire partially flat. He changed direction and walked up to it. The door was open. Inside it was musty. He got in. Under the floor mat he found a key. He turned the ignition and the engine turned over but didn't start. He tried again and the same. He tried a third time and it started.
  When the engine had warmed for several minutes he put it into gear and drove it slowly off the lot, out the exit gate. He returned to the Tom Thumb and put some air in the flat tire. Now the thing to do was to get to Kennesaw, pay off Rodriguez the ten thousand, buy himself some time. So he started the car and pulled around and parked around the back side of the gas station, where he could observe the garage and the mechanics. He switched off the car and sat there for some time, watching them. 
  Ever so often they'd scan the parking lot, looking for him no doubt, then return to the job at hand. He hooked up the device and placed it on his head. After becoming acclimated he spied on them again. Inside he was seething. Most of all he wanted to see the manager James. Soon he came out of the office and sipped from the water fountain. He used this moment to focus in on him, traveling inward, inward as much as he could, directing his rage inward. And then as he was walking back into the office he slipped on a spot on the concrete floor and fell hard onto his back and his head banged the concrete floor hard. The others saw the accident and ran over to him. He sat up, looking confused, disoriented, and felt around the back of his head. On his fingers was blood.
  One of the mechanics grabbed a rag and brought it over and held it over his wound. Eventually one of them stuck out his forearm and James held on and pulled himself up. He was a bit shaken, laughing it off. The other guys laughed too but they secretly looked one to another with concern. He watched James enter the office and sit behind the desk. He sat there for some time, not doing anything, staring at the paperwork. A couple times he rose from the seat but sat down again, confused.
  He could not explain the mechanism by which the event occurred but he felt as if he could do it again if he wanted, and without  too much difficulty. It was a matter of projecting your own thoughts into the subject. He hadn't commanded James to slip and fall on the floor. It didn't seem to work specifically like that. It was like he had been projecting the thought of _harm_ towards him and something within James had received that thought and then acted upon it, and from what he could tell, it was on a completely subconscious level.
  From here he could see into the office by a little window. He could see his forehead and a little of his shoulders but that was all. He decided to try it again. All he had to do was think of the beating James had given him and all the rage and anger rose up again in his imagination, and he once again projected those feelings towards his adversary. A moment later James picked up a stapler and a moment after that he heard the muffled shouting from inside the office. He saw him dancing around inside, the staple gun hanging from his thumb. A couple of the mechanics went inside and looked shocked. It appeared that he had not just stapled his thumb but had stapled through his thumbnail into the quick. James held out his arm and one of the guys gave a tug upwards and it came out. There was some blood but not a lot. He wrapped it with the same rag he had used only minutes ago on the wound from his fall.
  It was getting to be quitting time. He saw the others wrapping up their work, sweeping the floor. One of them got into the bus they were working on and started it. He pulled out of the garage and seemed to be finding a spot to park it for the night, outside. He focused in on the driver and kept focusing while he did a three point turn in the parking lot. But then when the bus was in reverse it suddenly accelerated at full speed backwards. The driver looked as if he had forgotten how to drive. As the bus gained speed the driver laid on the horn just as the rear of the bus smashed into the front of the red Tacoma, still parked in the same spot as before. The bumper and hood of the pickup crumpled and inside the cab the driver side airbag deployed. The force of the impact pushed the truck into the ditch. For a few seconds the wheels of the bus kept spinning until finally it seemed the driver regained control and put the bus in park. The side door to the bus flew open and the man jumped out and looked with horror at what he had done. Soon after that James saw the wreckage and took off in a sprint over to it. He was shouting and raising his fist in the air.
  The driver of the bus raised his hands and looked as if he were apologizing. James did not even hesitate. He shoved the guy to the dirt and began pummeling his face. The others came over and pulled him off. He relented and came up face red and chest heaving. The driver lay there holding his nose. James was shouting in frustration and went to the oak tree nearby and kicked it with all his strength, which seemed to only injure himself as he limped back to the others.
  He started to imagine the possibilities this device had and more importantly he started to understand why it was so deadly important to his pursuers. In the wrong hands this device could do some real damage. He watched them pull the bus around to the side of the building. He saw James walk over and apologize to the mechanic who drove the bus though he still looked very upset. They eventually shook hands. James got into the pickup and started it up. It still ran. He put it in gear and turned the wheels. It was drivable. They pulled the sliding metal door closed and locked it up. By then the sun was going down, the evening cold and the light darkening. Cars on the road next to the shop already had their headlights on. 
  He removed the device and put it into the backpack. When he saw the wrecked Toyota pull into the side street to enter traffic he backed out of the Tom Thumb parking lot and turned in the same direction, several cars behind. If you had asked him why he was following the driver of the Tacoma he would not have been able to say why. The smarter thing would have been to drive on to Kennesaw and pay down his debts to Rodriguez. But the anger he felt had not been erased by his acts of revenge. In fact they only seemed stronger. Whenever he imagined James kicking him in the ribs he felt a welling of frustration and violence inside. He breathing was so rapid and shallow it looked as if he had run a marathon.
  "Motherfucker."
  He clenched the steering wheel of the Citation and growled violently. He beat the passenger seat with his right fist.
"You goddamn sonofabitch. I'll murder you. I'll eat your liver. I'll eat your brains and kidneys and rip out your fucking spinal cord and shove it up your ass!"
  James took the bypass home and he followed close behind. By now it was dark and there was no way for him to be spotted so he was not concerned about that. James turned onto Eden Valley road and disappeared around the first curve of that road. He followed him there and when he made the curve he saw the red tail lights just ahead. No lights on this road. They were in the country now. No other cars. Now was the time.
  He floored the accelerator and heard the engine rev and saw those tail lights getting closer by the second. And then a hard crunch as the Citation rammed into the rear of the Tacoma. The truck swerved into the next lane and accelerated at the same time. He nearly lost control of it, even going off the road into the brush for a moment but then brought it back. He took the opportunity of confusion to ram the truck again, this time clipping the side. He laid on his horn at the same time. He saw James in the cabin turning around, headlights on his face. He looked terrified as he just floored it. By now he was probably going seventy, on these back roads that was a death sentence.
  But then he laid off the gas. He switched off his own headlights and drove in the dark, far behind him.
  The Tacoma continued to drive fast and nearly lost it around some curves up the road. He had another idea what to do and was a least a quarter mile behind at this point, following the small tail lights in the dark, using them to tell him where to go. He made a right turn here and a left turn there and came to Price road. When he turned onto Price he kept back even further. He saw the Tacoma pull into a driveway and found a spot off the road to park, hidden from the road, behind the bushes and trees.
  He got out of the Citation and walked the road to where he had seen the Tacoma pull in. It was a nice house, painted white with gray shutters, simple but modern, with a front porch and a garage, and a large yard in front, with kids toys strewn about. A nice home to raise a family. He stayed in the darkness of the bushes as he approached the house on the other side of the road. James it seemed was still in the Tacoma. Soon he got out and walked around the vehicle, from time to time looking up the road. He was on his cell phone. Eventually he saw a patrol car pull in from the other direction. An officer got out and shook his hand. He seemed to be telling him the story of the truck but more importantly how some crazy driver had crashed into him on the way home. He showed him the damage to the rear of the truck. The officer took down notes on a pad.
  At that point the porch light came on and a woman in a night gown and coat came down the steps. James turned to her and they embraced. When she saw the damage to the Tacoma a hand went to her mouth and her eyes widened. She rubbed his back in consolation. He watched and all those feelings of rage melted into jealousy. What a kind and beautiful woman. She had always been kind to him. His fucking up their relationship was something he'd never forgive himself for. Now she had moved on and found a provider, stable, in good health. But the pangs in his heart did not leave him. Still as beautiful as ever she was. It had been over a year since he'd last seen her, at the court hearing. Maturity was making her even more beautiful, untouchable in some way. She gave off a glow that to him felt decent and radiant and heartwarm.
  "Suzanne," he whispered from the shadows of the woods across the street. Speaking her name brought her closer to him, somehow. Made their time together more real. She held onto his arm like she used to hold onto his. It hurt to see that. The police officer got back in the patrol car and backed out. He ducked in the bushes so as not to be seen. When its tail lights had disappeared around the curve in the road he stood up again.
  James and Suzanne were on the porch, gazing with forlorn expressions at the pickup, holding onto one another for support. They went inside and turned off the porch light. He came out of the bushes and walked across the street, closer to their house, where he could see into the large bay window. Through the living room he could see the kitchen, Suzanne in the kitchen, finishing dinner for them. James was not around, probably washing up, changing into more comfortable clothes. He went closer, now in their yard, hiding under the canopy of a Southern Magnolia. The smell of the food seeped through the cracks in the ventilation, through the windows and doors. He smelled her meatloaf, mashed potatoes, and green beans cooked in ham. James entered the kitchen just as she was pulling a hot rolls from the oven. She set the aluminum pan on the kitchen table and broke them apart. Her husband came up behind her and wrapped his arms around her waist. He saw her eyes shut and a warm smile appear on her face. She turned with the pot holders still over her hands and kissed him.
  Tears fell onto his cheeks. They nearly froze in the cold January air. He looked above him and heard the large, waxen leaves rustling in the wind. Beyond them he saw the sky, black out here in the country, the stars shining bright. The tears he wiped away. They had surprised him because he had not even realized he was crying. But it made sense. So many things made sense to him now. He missed her. God how he missed her. 
  And then his boy Joseph, now taller and dark in the hair than he remembered, sauntered into the dining room, giggling. He ran up to James and hugged his legs. James ruffled his hair and leaned down and kissed the top of the boy's head. Then the family sat down to dinner.
  He watched them eat and talk to one another. He guessed the main topic tonight was the truck and how one of the guys at the shop hit it with a school bus and then how a crazy person out of nowhere rammed his car down on Morrison Campground. His eyes were fixed on his boy. His heart dropped out of him as he realized how much time had really passed since he had seen him. How important all those days and weeks and months are to a child. He was growing. He had grown so much. The ache he felt inside was like a bottomless pit sucking the rest of him into it. He wanted so much to provide for his son. To be able to provide for him. To give to him. To give him the world if he asked. To give and give again and never stop giving.

  He awoke with a jolt the next morning and before he even realized where he was he gripped the steering wheel with both hands, as if to avoid an immanent traffic accident. But the car was parked. The sound that had woken him was only a nearby Mexican worker with a leaf blower, creating a wind storm for all the rogue leaves in the same parking lot where the Citation was sitting. He wiped his eyes and looked all around. He did not remember driving here. He didn't even know where here was.
  The laptop was open in the passenger seat. He pushed some keys on the keyboard but it seemed it had run out of battery. The device sat in the floorboard, crumpled. The parking lot was mostly empty, a few cars here and there. Nice ones. A Lexus, a late-model Range Rover in burgundy, a silver BMW.
  His mouth was very dry and he had a crick in his neck from sleeping in the drivers seat all night. He got out of the car and stretched. The morning air was crisp and cold, the sky clear, a bright sun just over a huge, white office complex across the street. He waved his hands at the Mexican with the leaf blower. After several seconds of no acknowledgement he walked up and waved his hands directly in front of his face. The Mexican looked up, wearing safety glasses, and pulled one of the neon green earplugs out of his ear. He then switched off the blower and all of a sudden the man could hear again.
  "Where are we?"
  "Que?"
  "What is this place?"
  "Name this place?"
  "Yes. Si."
  "Avalon."
  "What?"
  "Avalon. Av-a-lon."
  He thanked him and the Mexican went back to work. He knew Avalon. It was an upscale outdoor shopping center in the next town over. Just opened, right after Thanksgiving. He had never been there, here. He had only heard the ads on the radio. He packed up the computer and device into the backpack, slung it over his shoulder, and walked towards what looked like the main entrance way, trying to remember why he had driven here the night before.
  It was very nice, much nicer than any mall or store he had ever been to. What struck him the most was how clean everything was. Some of that had to do with the newness of it. But part of it too was how expensive and refined the buildings were. It was like they had spared no expense. The buildings were all the same, a beige sandstone with dark gray trim. The concrete sidewalk was almost white and ever so often there would be a little Bradford Pear tree, its limbs barren now. But in springtime he knew it would be that much more fancy. At the end of the main block he spotted a place that looked open. There was a couple sitting outside, drinking smoothies. He decided to walk there to see if he could find a place to charge up the computer.
  The place was called Just Juice. The sign was bright orange and purple. He went inside where everything was very clean, just like outside. Like a museum. It felt so clean it made him uncomfortable, like he was contaminating the perfection of the place with his human body, with all its hair and sweat and skin. A young woman stood at the counter with a large smile.
  "Good Morning! Welcome to Just Juice. What can I get for you today, sir?"
  "You got coffee?"
  The woman closed her smile just a bit, and winced, as if she hated to have to give him bad news.
  "No sir, we're just juice. For breakfast we make really great smoothies. Would you like one of those?"
  "Yeah, I'll have a smoothie."
  "What flavor combination would you like this morning?"
  "What flavors you got?"
  She pointed to the sign above her.
  "I'll have the strawberry."
  "You get two flavors and one extra for a dollar."
  "Just double the strawberry."
  "Okay, sir. That'll be $5.99."
  While he waited he looked for a free outlet but didn't see any inside. Out the window he saw an extension cord connected to a power strip, with a single fan hooked to it. He figured he could use one of those outlets. A few minutes later the woman handed him the smoothie and he went outside and sat around one of the tables with the umbrella in the middle, close enough that the power cord would reach to the extension cord. He took a sip of the smoothie but found it way too sweet. So he went back inside and ordered a water, just something to quench his dry mouth. Then he sat outside and let the computer charge, all while trying to remember what had brought him here the night before.
  And then he did remember. After leaving the house where he saw Suzanne and Joseph, and that guy James he had the radio on, and heard about a sale at Avalon for one of those video game systems that Joseph had been wanting. So he got on the road and drove here, not thinking the place would be closed. So he pulled into the parking lot and must have fallen asleep. There was a lot going on and he had the feeling that using the device might of had something to do with it too.
  A couple hours later it was warmer and the shopping center was picking up a crowd. The sidewalks were dotted with packs of families, groups of women, carrying bags, dressed to the nines in fancy clothes they probably bought here. He felt out of place but didn't feel like getting up at the moment. The computer was nearly charged. And then, coming down the sidewalk, he saw a woman by herself. He sat up and watched her. There was something about the way her auburn hair blew in the wind and the way her thin figure filled out the peacoat she wore in just the right places, with just the right curves. Her delicate neck was exposed whenever the wind blew her hair the right way and her gloved hands he could tell were just as delicate.
