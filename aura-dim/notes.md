Epilogue begins: My imprisoners depart and I am left alone. In the silence and the darkness of this room I return again to the place I once was.

Epilogue: And then he goes. And the door closes. And the darkness and the silence returns. So then I return to the place I was.

Prologue: Rewrite in First Person

Do not abandon me in this wilderness. Do not abandon me in my days of needs. Come back to me. Father, please. In the wilderness I will wait for you.


15 ============================================

  What happens in this scene?

  We are in an impressionistic memory of Zoey's birthday party, from her point of view, and then when playing tag the grass with her friends, it changes into Joseph's memory of their day flighting the kite together, ending with him waiting for father in the woods.

  What is the purpose of this scene?

  To establish that Zoey no longer needs the technology to utilize the Aura communion. To establish that Joseph believes in his father.


Hears the voice, unsure where its coming from
Asks questions
Is told it is not his place to ask questions
Is reminded of his recent actions, theft, rape, murder
Defends himself, saying his loves his family, his son
Comparison with a dog. But you are forgiven. We expect nothing from you, except to obey.
I ain't free. I ain't never been free.
You are free. But you don't want freedom. What people want.

Zoey is free. She will release the technology and it will change the world.
It's not her decision to make. She doesn't get to decide.
How he helped them find Zoey, how he only sees what they want him to see.
Show me her.
You won't like what you see.
Clocks out for a break.
Walks downstairs where a man leads him downstairs, through a corridor.
Finds Zoey, like a skeleton. She won't eat. We force her to drink. She'll die soon.
Looks at her. She recognizes him. A tear falls from her eye.
He is reminded his break is over. Walks out.

I done it for my family. I done it for my boy.
Say why
I done it for the money.


I do not understand this wilderness or the creatures who inhabit the darkness here. I do not understand how they are able to live or what they feed upon to give them strength. The laws which govern this place are alien to me. I am filled with confusion and doubt. I am lost.

Explanation from voice, we were always following you, choosing for you, people dont want control, woman is dead

Unfortunately it doesn't work that way, James. You are not in a position to ask questions of us. You are not in control here. This will be hard for you to accept but it is the truth, and you will understand that truth in time. Further, you are not in control of your own life. You never have been. You never will be. Do you know the most influential force in the world? Inertia. People do not want freedom. They want comfort. To be taken care of. A life of ease and entertainment, of rich food and parties. To be soothed and pampered from the time they are born until their bodies are lowered into the ground.

That ain't true. I love. I have loved. My boy. I love him more than my own life. I know that.

Dogs love their own James. Do you think of yourself angelic because of that? It is instinct. He loves you because you provide for him, give him that comfort we are speaking about. And you love him because of chemicals in your nervous system, millions of years of genetic programming to keep our species propagating. That's all.
That's not true.
We are afraid so.

As you judged others we judged you. We forgive you.


People want to sleepwalk through life, people want to get fat. Once you had access to the device what did you do? You might have done anything, you looted a pimp, a restaurant owner, a lawyer. Think about that won't you.


He leads her to them. They had been monitoring him all along.
We judged you as you judged others. Why didn't you help the girl in the hotel room? Why didn't you stop to help the people in the car accident?
You were supposed to kill our man. You were supposed to discover the keycard. As we suspected you felt nothing.
Talks through intercom.
She did this to herself. No clothes, no food or water.
Talks in the voice of his son, forgiveness. Return to me, father return. Forgive others as I have forgiven you. This is my prayer.
There's no such thing as a search for power. Only a search for security, for comfort. We provide that. That is our purpose. We are justified by your actions. It is a good for the service of mankind.

After being told that his life is not his own, the evil he's done is not his concern. Do not worry, it was not you. But that was a lie.

And you sold drugs to Grady and Jenn, long before we ever met, and maybe you were afraid to get caught with the computer at their botched robbery so maybe you killed them. You definitely have it in you. You murdered Randall, after all. Are you beginning to understand how things really are? We control the narrative. We control you. You work for us. You will work for us. I know there is a part of you that wants to believe you are free. That you ultimately decide the way your life is. But that is't so. You are not free. You have never been free. More than that, you don't want to be free.

Who is us? Who are you? I don't get the big picture.
It doesn't matter who we are, or what you call us, the company, the government, the man, the 1%, we are those who make the decisions about how things will be and you are he who obeys.


You're not a good person. That is true. But you don't have to be. You have no need to feel guilt anymore. It's OK. Morality is a human invention. It has outlived its usefulness for control, we have better tools. We have technology. Be who you are. Do not be ashamed.
The mutilators. The desecrators.
In the GE plant, am I really here? I don't know if I'm here. Well you tell me? But I don't know. Then what difference does it make.
Don't say things like that. Like what? Like killin don't matter. Well it doesn't. Folks don't talk like this. This is a movie. I'm afraid not. This is our new world, a world of the Aura stream, properly moderated of course, properly calibrated, we don't want to hurt anyone, after all. You're full of shit. I can't understand you.





It's been fifteen minutes. Return to your station.










They get so happy. And it makes me very sad. Because something has been lost.

The workers on the assembly line are folding some organic matter from a black square into a ball.

14a ======================================================

What happens in this scene?

Will awakens in a strange place, on a table, wrapped in bandages. His wounds are dressed. Time has passed and he is no longer in any pain. He is wearing coveralls. He unwraps his head and looks at himself in the mirror, he's covered in scar tissue, no hair on his head. He breaks down. He leaves the room and walks through an empty building, the ceiling caved in, water pooled on the floor. Very dark. He sees boxes piled and hears something like a generator in the next room. He enters the next room, up some stairs, and there is a long conveyor belt, affixed to machinery, rusted. Out of the machine is the blob and men in coveralls like his own are hard at work down the line, packing it into the boxes. He sees a light on in an office above the line and walks up to it but no one is in the office. But he hears a voice in his head.

What is the purpose of this scene?

To describe what he sees. To lead into the scene with the voice.

13b ======================================================

What happens in this scene?

To wait until night to cross the street, sidewalks, in another set of woods behind the ruins of the GE plant. Scales the fence and traverses the parking lot, around the broken glass, the faded paint on the aluminum walls, the rusted door with a circle and an x through it, sealed with a keypad lock.

What is the purpose of this scene?

To reveal where he is going. To build mystery what's behind the door to the plant.

13a ======================================================

What happens in this scene?

Will hides in the woods, delirious from his wounds, hurting in the sunlight, he creeps during the day, hiding in the brush and only when its night does he emerge and make his way out of the woods. A dog approaches him, a large black dog. It sniffs and starts to attack his arm, biting into it. He beats it with a piece of wood until its dead.

What is the purpose of this scene?

To establish the extent of his burns, to show that he is going somewhere and to build mystery from that


12a ======================================================

What happens in this scene?

Will uses clues to locate Zoey, a landmark in the photo that he recognizes. He goes there, sees the place and explores it. Zoey is not there. The house is dilapidated, her computer is set up in her old bedroom. 

What is the purpose of this scene?

To build anticipation for the climax, to show that the character is invested in Zoey since their communion.


Richard was a painter who never sold his paintings until he caught on during an election. Now selling plastic frames.


He has to find the house, something in the background of the photo gives him a clue, a landmark, the house number

"You were a painter. And I watched how you betrayed it. Over the years...I saw that much."
  
He walks inside the house, sees the equipment, then outside to birthday party.

I'm very close to being able to open a two-way channel. 
The one-way channel is too invasive. It shouldn't ever be used. 
How do you know?
I've done it.
The President of the United States.
Zoey, that's treasonous
I know but I did it. And it works.
A two-way channel is secure. It depends on a handshake, it asks permission. I need more time to get there.
It's possible that what's happening is the technology acts as an amplifier to some dormant capability of the human brain. In other words the technology is just an amplifier, like waving a fan over flames.
What are you saying?
I don't really know but it seems possible that once the brain has used this channel enough, the technology would no longer be required.
Zoey, this is extremely dangerous. What you are talking about. This needs to be regulated. Controlled.
You can't control it. It's not yours to control. Its something within us. Untapped.
There may be a reason for that. Did you ever think of that?
Maybe its time has come. It's like Darwin and the theory of evolution. If not me, then someone else.


As he walks through the woods he finds a black dog, who attacks him. He kills the dog.

1000
Start with how it’s different, not direct communication, free access to her being and she had free access to his, she saw the things he had done but he did not feel judged, she is able to guide his focus.

4000
  1500: She shows him the story of how she discovered the technology, and how she tested it and the breakthrough which led to it becoming a one-way tool to a two-way communication tool
  2000: her dream of Donald Trump
  2000: what her vision of the future is. That the device is only an amplifier to something dormant within us. Once awoken the device will not be necessary. 

4000
But then reality as she introduced it to Richard, the corporate stranglehold and difference of vision, intimdation from men in suits, ending with her fleeing the night Grady and Jenn broke into the facility. 

1000
Pulling out of the birthday party, Help Me...


You talk about your work and you can tell nobody gives a damn. But as soon as you mention money, watch their eyes light up. Then you see what truly stirs their souls.

You sound like you're reading a poem. Get real. This technology is not ethical.


Do you mind if we take this?
Sure, that's fine. Go ahead.

Does meth. They stand in line, hands over possessions. I'm an addict and I need a fix, gets a grain, eats it all. She starts running, kicking children, breathes shallowly. He calms her. He takes her to customer service, to ask for help. I'm afraid she might overdose on the meth she took. A giant with a head like two flaps of skin and a hollow inside walks up to her. She falls on the floor asleep and the man wraps the flaps around her head and begins extracting the meth.


He wanted to give him everything. Give him the world if he could. To give and give and keep on giving.

He texts Grady's cell with offer to sell computer for a million. when they learn he has device he'll make 
another offer. Where? He gets on computer and opens map program.

duckdodgers2450@protonmail.com wants to be your friend. Do you accept?

duckdodgers2450: who r u
duckdodgers2450: do u have the device
z.jackson: yes

duckdodgers2450: ?
z.jackson: yes
duckdodgers2450: run it pls

It really was her. She was alive.

Tells story of her developing technology, friction with Richard Dewey, ostracized by teammates. Not a weapon, a tool for empathy and ultimately communication. V1 requires subject in range but V2 works with media of subject. Test on Donald Trump, most despicable person she can imagine. His dream. Interest by government, military. Fallout with Richard Dewey. A vision of the future, of what's possible, back to the party, inside the photograph, walks among the party-goers. On the cake, a message from Zoey, "Help Me".

Then uses already open map program, and sees the road sign in the back of the photo, locates it.

11a ======================================================

What happens in this scene?

Will communes with Zoey. He describes what the experience is like. And then he explores her memories of the discovery of the aura stream.

What is the purpose of this scene?

To show how a two-way communication stream works. To deepen the story of Zoey.


10 ======================================================

What happens in this scene?

Will activates a burner cell phone he purchased at WalMart and texts Grady's cell phone with the message that he's willing to sell the computer for one million dollars cash. He figures they do not yet know about the device and that he'll protect himself with the knowledge that he has it. They ask for a location. He looks on Google Maps to find a suitable spot and tells them by the quarry, where he used to go drink beer with friends, with no place they can sneak up on him. After his text he message from duckdodgers2450@protonmail.com, asking who he is. He plays coy but eventually convinces the person he is sincere. He is emailed an executable called aura2 and told to run it with the device connected and focus on the girl in the background of the desktop. It was her.

What is the purpose of this scene?

To show that he realizes how valuable the device is and also that he plans to profit from it. To reveal that Zoey is not dead, to build suspense to what he sees when they commune.

09 ======================================================

What happens in this scene?

Will gives the gifts to Joseph, setting them on the porch in the evening, just before bed.

What is the purpose of this scene?

To connect with the last scene, show him giving what he is able to give, seeing his son and having a moment of connection

08a ======================================================

What happens in this scene?

Will wakes in his car in the parking lot to Avalon, an upscale shopping center the next town over. He finds an outside cafe where he can charge the computer, watching people go by, sees a woman who he can't take his eyes off of.

What is the purpose of this scene?

To establish the change of scene, set up that he is getting the computer ready. Introduce woman (do not compare her to Suzanne)

07b ======================================================

What happens in this scene?

He gets out the machine and tortures the workers, both funny ways and not. He ruins the guys truck bed by having a guy pull out in a truck and smash into it. Follows the man home after, tries to run him off the road. At the house he watches him go in, shaken, calls police. Sees family greet him. It's Suzanne and Joseph.

What is the purpose of this scene?

To establish he can control people with the device. To establish the man's real identity and his connection to Will.

07a ======================================================

What happens in this scene?

Will needs a car so he is walking around, looking for one. He sees a bright red Tacoma in a mechanic shop's parking lot, along with several other cars. He sees the workers in the shop, the large doors are open. He finds a spot to hide in the bushes across the street and gets out the device, while still on his back. He looks at each of them, trying to learn about the cars and where the keys are. One guy has a brand new 4x4 Toyota Tacoma, metallic red. He keeps a spare key in a holder under the rear wheel well. This is good enough for him. His idea is to take the truck, drive it to Kennesaw with the 10K, pay off Rodriguez with the car and the money. Rodriguez deals with hot cars all the time. When he walks over there, he is discovered and runs, a man catches him and beats the shit out of him for messing with his truck. I'll be keeping an eye out. Fuck with my truck again and I'll call the cops. He walks off, wanders through a Storage parking lot. Towards the back he finds a Chevrolet Citation parked there. It looks like its been sitting there for a long time. He walks over, the door is open. Under the floorboard mat he finds the key. Drives off but feels compelled to park in a nearby gas station, side spot, where he has a clear view of the garage and parking lot. He gets out the machine

What is the purpose of this scene?

To introduced nemesis, though unknown. To get him in a car, a boxy model from the 80s. To establish he can control people with the device.

06 ======================================================

What happens in this scene?

Will dons the device and is immediately immersed in a strange environment. He feels as if he has been transported to the bottom of a deep ocean. The light is very dim, sounds like underwater, resonant, as if from far away, his vision dim, things coming into and out of focus. Some dark shape approaching him, slowly. He cannot stop staring. Then his eyes slowly become accustomed and he realizes he is still in the Waffle House, the shape he sees is the waitress coming towards him with a pot of coffee. He watches her walk for minutes, approaching, moving almost imperceptibly towards him. But he cannot look away. After awhile the hazy scene fades, things are not the same exactly. The people he sees are more transparent, not bodily. But they are even more dimensional in a way he could see straight into. Looks at them, one scary individual at the bar is counting his money in his mind, as he eats a double cheeseburger and hashbrowns.

What is the purpose of this scene?

To introduce the device, deepen the mystery, answer a bit of what is going on.


05 ======================================================

What happens in this scene?

After a short nap, Will drives to the research facility to look for the device, before dawn. He finds it in a drawer but doesn't realize it until he puts the clue together when seeing the photo of the group in the lobby. Zoey is wearing the pink kitty hat, looks bored, and remembers 'I hid it where them boys will never find it.' When he leaves he is chased by a car, is shot at. He crashes the pickup into a pole coming into town. He runs on the side streets, ducks in a coffee shop, 'Sir, can I get you a coffee?' But they enter and and pull gun, everyone dives to the ground, he runs out to a back alley and hides in a parking garage. When he's sure they're gone he jogs to a waffle house and sits down to collect his thoughts, has a cup of coffee, pecan waffle, and a side of bacon. He finally feels safe enough and gets out the laptop and hooks in the device.

What is the purpose of this scene?

For Will to get ahold of the device, to take away his vehicle, to ratchet up the tension, danger, to create a compelling lead-in for the next scene.

04a =====================================================

What happens in this scene?

What is the purpose of this scene?
To introduce readers to Zoey, establish her character. To introduce mystery of the device, that it was based on a technology that Zoey developed in secret, while working for this research department. That there was a confrontation and intimidation by men in suits.

03b =====================================================

What happens in this scene?
Will runs into a 24 hour clinic and lab facility, ends up in the xray room, surrounded by nurses, saying no one is here, sir. We can't give you any drugs, sir. Give me the fucking pen, you bitch! Takes it from the nurse, who is afraid he'll commit suicide. He writes down the number in the phone, takes a large machine and crushes it. He runs off and takes a route through the woods and down under the path along the river back to the library. Inside the library he walks upstairs to a small bathroom near the back. He hides in a stall, on top of the toilet, until closing time, only an hour. Someone opens the door and says, 'Anybody in here? We're closing for the day.' Once alone in the empty library he finds a computer and researches how to bypass a login on an Apple computer. He fights with it, not understanding the technical details, then at last he gets in.

What is the purpose of this scene?
To ratchet up the tension, paranoia, and erractic behavior of Will. To strip away his possessions. To show his ingenuity. To create a compelling end note for the section leading to the emails, chats...etc.

03a =====================================================

What happens in this scene?
Will, concerned they may have seen his truck, parks at the library across the river, down the street, and hoofs it back to the weekly-rate hotel where he discovers his room has been ransacked. Upon discovering this, he immediately locks the door and sees two old box-style sedans in the parking lot, with dark figures inside. He finds all his documents strewn, the restraining order from Suzanne. At this time he receives another text asking where is the notebook? i don't have it. please stay put, the message says. by now the sun is going down. he phones in a fire in room 216 nextdoor and awaits the fire engine, ambulance, and several police cars to arrive. then he makes his escape to the bin, he hears them outside, throws a garbage bag onto the ground in the opposite direction, sees the dark figures pounce and leaps out the other side, dashes up the hill, and runs into a 24 hour clinic and lab facility, ends up in the xray room, surrounded by nurses, saying no one is here, sir. We can't give you any drugs, sir. Give me a fucking pen!!! Takes it from the nurse, who is afraid he'll commit suicide. He writes down the number in the phone, takes a large machine and crushes it. He runs off and takes a route through the woods and down under the path along the river back to the library.

What is the purpose of this scene?
To establish they know where he lives and are actively after him. To ratchet up the tension, paranoia. To strip away his possessions.


02b =====================================================

What happens in this scene?

Will enters the mobile home through a child's bedroom. There is suspense as he walks through the hallway. Calls out for Grady and Jenn? The house is a disaster area, trash, clothes piled up, ashtray full, boxes of fast food, pizza boxes, a rank smell, not old garbage. In the bedroom he finds a bloodbath, splatters of blood on the walls, closet, nightstand and the bed a pool of limbs, viscera. Mutilated. He backs away in horror, falls down and sits on the sofa, breathing heavily. Then jumps when he gets a text. He takes a deep breath in while he turns over the phone, from Grady. "We need the notebook back. Stay put." He looks out the window and sees a car coming up the drive, dashes off through the woods, sloshes through the leaves. Hears shouting, hears the back door open of the trailer. Gets in his truck and leaves, driving through the drainage ditch.

What is the purpose of this scene?

To escalate the value of the computer, to show that its own by some malevolent force, to introduce an element of horror, to introduce the shadow people who in this scene are heard but not seen. To establish they have Grady's cell phone.


01a =====================================================

What happens in this scene?
Will meets Grady and Jenn behind the Huffaker Crossing Strip mall, to sell them meth. It is sleeting outside. They are driving an old Dodge Dart. Will is waiting for them. They get into his truck with a backpack. Jenn tells Will this is their last time. Will doesn't speak much if at all. Jenn kids him about this and tells him how bad meth is. Three hundred, he tells them. Grady and Jenn awkwardly reach for the backpack. Will draws the gun and points it at them. Whoa, buddy! It's just a notebook. What? A notebook, that's all it is. We wanted to tell you...Computer? Yeah, computer, notebook you know. It's got all the wires. They want to trade for the meth.

What is the purpose of this scene?
To establish that Will is living a different kind of life as a drug dealer, that it is mid-winter, that Will is not the same Will we saw before, harder, violent. To introduce us to Grady and Jenn. To introduce the notebook.


01 =====================================================

What happens in this scene?
Will, his boy Joseph, and his wife Suzanne fly a kite in the tall grass field on a nice spring day. After, they have a picnic of burgers, potato salad, pickles, with sweet tea to drink. After, they nap and daydream, Joseph goes to pee by himself, gets lost in the woods. Will runs through the woods to find him, shouting his name. He finds Joseph crying in a dark part of the woods, tangled in thorns. He extracts him and holds him. Joseph is shivering and shaking. He carries him out and they eat fried strawberry pies.

What is the purpose of this scene?
To set up the end, to show how life used to be for Will. To establish they are rural people, the setting rural, when life is good, in order to contrast later.




Makes a deal with the juggalo to not tell if he pays him, after being caught.
What if I just gut you right now?
Then you'll have to dispose of my body. Not easy. More chance to get caught. I'm not greedy, just 
give me half, I walk away for good. I know if you see me again, you'll kill me.
You not gonna say nothin?
Ain't my business. 
Not gonna go to the cops?
I just need money.
Hard to make a livin these days.
You tellin me?

Atlantis, not Avalon


When he gets out with 5K, he figures he needs a car to make the drive to Kennesaw to pay off Rodriguez.
That leads him to the truck in the big truck garage parking lot. He figures out how to use the device while the laptop is in 
his backpack, but the computer will only last five hours or so. He uses it and learns the location of the keys...gets caught, beat up, 
finds another car with keys in it but returns to the garage to mess with the man (somehow he needs to discover he has control). Forklift drops a load onto the truck bed, denting it badly. Follows the man home. He sees Suzanne and Joseph welcome him. Suzanne is pregnant. He drives off.
  
Bound prostitute has ties to Amara from Trinidad
He finds another car, boxy old model, with keys under the seat
Woman in coffee shop asks if he'd like anything. He says 'Coffee', just before the men enter
At the Waffle House the waitress brings him a coffee withot asking, he also gets a pecan waffle and side of bacon

But what about the body? The police said they identified Zoey Jackson.
You know what we want you to know, haven't you figured that out by now?

Daddy, can I have your pickle? 
Boy you gonna turn into a pickle one of these days.
No I ain't.
Go on then, eat it and see what happens.
Suzanne, look at Joseph. Look, he's turning all green. I think he's turning into a pickle!

He nestled his head on her chest.
Baby.
What?
Your titties sure do make good pillows.
Thanks honey, that's sweet of you to say.

Why did you do it?
I done it for the money. And now my life is ruint. And I can't ever go out in the sunlight like I used to done.

The promise of money gives him hope, a euphoria.

Someone snaps a photo of him the first night in the hotel, when drunk, when the police are there.

The man who hires Zoey is the project lead, you answer to him. He uses a phrase, something unique 'I reckon...' and at voice at the end uses the same phrase, this is how we know its him.

Try not to describe surroundings outside of action. Avoid rote phrasing, cliches, or telegraphing ideas. Do not narrate the story like someone telling a story around a campfire. It must be immediate, immersive, present.

"There's always that one person that always has hope in you, and when that last person gives up on you," he says, before trailing off. 
"I don't think that person realizes how that little bit of hope they had for you helps keep you alive."

Because I am your child I believe in you. I am from you. I am you. With your eyes I gaze upon you. With your ears I listen to you. Do not abandon me in the wilderness. Do not abandon me in my days of need. Return to me. In the wilderness I will wait for you.

Opening of the book, a scene describing the beautiful day at Berry flying a kite in the tall grass, boy crawling in the grass like a puppy, a picnic of cheeseburgers and onion rings and fried strawberry pies. Mother is with them while flying the kite. Mister Joseph. Which way is the wind blowing? Plans to go to the 411 drive in. What are you thinking about, baby?

Has the restraining order taped to the mirror of his hotel room, to keep him strong. Unexpressed desire to make things right. Save money, puts it in a hidden stash. This money gets taken when his room is ransacked for the computer.

This is not my circus. These are not my monkeys.

I wish my parents were still alive.

'The neanderthals who discovered fire did not understand the chemistry behind 
combustion, but importantly that didn't prevent them from harnessing it for the 
benefit of humanity.'

- quote from something

He sees this before knowing what is going on, what the device is

The device can only go one-way. She has figured out how to make it work two-ways. Breakthrough.

Symptoms and Signs of a Meth Addict

During methamphetamine use, a person's pupils become dilated, their heart rate increases and they may show signs of physical exertion (such as sweatiness and elevated body temperature). They may seem particularly agitated, nervous or frustrated. Because it is a strong stimulant, users will often go for long periods - possibly even days at a time - without sleep and a diminished appetite. Looking gaunt, drawn or undernourished is frequently a cause for concern even if it isn't indicative of a drug addiction, but when coupled with other symptoms of meth abuse these signs should be taken very seriously. Over long periods of addiction, the harsh chemicals in the drug cause oral deterioration, often termed "meth mouth", and skin health also suffers as increased acne and sores from skin-picking begin to appear.

SHORT TERM EFFECTS INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING:
Increased heart rate and blood pressureIrregular heartbeat and cardiovascular problemsInsomniaIntense irritabilityAnxiety/ParanoiaConvulsionsPossibility of stroke

LONG TERM EFFECTS INCLUDE:
DelusionsAuditory hallucinationsViolent behaviorHomicidal or suicidal thoughts

A story about a man who buys a laptop off craigslist. A scientist has committed suicide, working on a prototype that was meant to change the world, his house robbed and lab burned to the ground. The man discovers its the laptop of the man who committed suicide.

He didn’t commit suicide. It was murder. He’s not really dead, destroyed the technology, the world isn’t ready for it. The man inadvertently releases into the world, where it falls into the wrong hands, despite the scientists best wishes.

The stream can work at different magnitudes. You can learn information, history, thoughts, dreams, ambitions. He uses it as a mind-reader and learns the man next door is a pimp, trafficking underage girls.

Privacy

Empathy > Telepathy > Mind-Reading

Sells edibles from Colorado. He lives in a non-descript town in North Georgia.

But the real application is telepathy, two way communication, and deeper than that, true empathy.

The technology works with media, images, video, sound, physical specimen

Neanderthals who discovered fire did not understand the physics or the chemistry behind 
combustion, but that didn't prevent them from using it for the benefit of everyone.

The Aura Stream

President Trump

Down on his luck, used to work the extruder at the carpet mill until it shut down. No more work, town like the molt of a cicada, retaining the shape but dead, brittle, hollow. Now I got this deal where this guy I know trucks edibles from Colorado every few weeks. They are harder to detect by drug dogs. I sell those on forums.

I used to think about what else I could do, but I don't feel any heart anymore, any excitement.

The scientist has gone mad? Holy fool. Absolute empathy.

The woman in the dark.
Make it dim. Make it dim.

The story ends with the main character emerging from somewhere, the government 
people are there, shadowy people, call out to him.

"Here I am."

Part One leads up to unlocking the encrypted drive to better understand the device. Turn, device is not just for mind reading, but for telepathy.

Part Two is story of the creation of the Aura algorithm and what led up to the fire. Turn, she is not really dead. Rant on money, feeling alone when friends abandon dreams.

Part Three, search for her, evade government agents, and company men. Turn, she is mad.

He needs to progress through three stages, maybe ending with empathy.

Drug buyers were hired to rough her up, steal equipment, government? corp?

Ends in vision of empathy

The man is bad in his heart. The woman is good in her heart. The discovery brings out 
what is in them. He becomes worse. She becomes better. We never know who the authority 
figures are, whether they represent the corporation or the government. At the end, 
he joins them, or rather it is left as an unknown, "Here I am."



Man: Fell on hard times -> Corrupt
Woman: Cold, analytic -> Empathetic


This is not science, this is pseudoscience at best. Snake Oil.
But it works.


Still got that lappy for sale?
Yeah I got it.
Take five hundred?
Its worth more than that.
How much you take?
Eight hundred, like it says in the ad.
Oh, alright then.

After returning from the deal with the laptop he looks out the window because 
the mexican who works the night shift at the office is beating on the door of the 
family across the way, the pimp next door is yelling at his girl, the pool with 
the brown tarp peeled back over dark green water, reminds him of a Florida vacation he 
took with his dad and brother and sister when they were just kids. They wore orange 
floatation balloons on their arms in the blue water of the pool and the sky was very blue against the 
white clouds. It was funny how clearly he could still recall it and even smell it and 
he then felt a deep sadness at how far he was now from those days and 
how fun it all was and how life would never again be so fun. He thought about that. 
Then he thought of his own son and what he was doing right now and if he would ever think about 
him as he remembered his own father and that was the last thing he thought before sleep took him.

I can't help you.

Unfortunately it doesn't work that way, James. You are not in a position to ask questions of us. You are not in control here. This will be hard for you to accept but it is the truth, and you will understand that truth in time. Further, you are not in control of your own life. You never have been. You never will be. Do you know the most influential force in the world? Inertia. People do not want freedom. They want comfort. To be taken care of. A life of ease and entertainment, of rich food and parties. To be soothed and pampered from the time they are born until their bodies are lowered into the ground.

That ain't true. I love. I have loved. My boy. I love him more than my own life. I know that.

Dogs love their own James. Do you think of yourself angelic because of that? It is instinct. He loves you because you provide for him, give him that comfort we are speaking about. And you love him because of chemicals in your nervous system, millions of years of genetic programming to keep our species propagating. That's all.
That's not true.
We are afraid so.

As you judged others we judged you. We forgive you.

In light of recent events I feel like I need to address something. There has been an unspoken presumption among us that I need to address at this time, especially now. The presumption is this - that only work which can make us money or has potential to make money in the future is worthy our time and attention. I reject that presumption. From the core of my being I reject it. And though I have no evidence for it, a part of me knows in fact the opposite is really the truth.

Leaves gifts for son. Is confronted by mother, calls him a piece of shit, gives the gifts back.

He learns the device is not for reading minds, it's for communication. Zoey opens a stream and they join. This is where he learns her story, the dream of Donald Trump, and where she is in hiding.

He leads her to them. They had been monitoring him all along.

DT in the back of a Maybach, listening to the original version of China Girl. Awash with feelings of feminine ecstasy, vulnerable, yielding.

DT slithering on his stomach like an obese serpant, his red tie scraping on the dirt, his head upturned, his beady eyes looking.
teener, ball, geeked up
Needs a scene where he exploits a woman's fantasy for his own pleasure.
He wakes up from a dream reunited with carol and walker, in his loneliness he finds an unhappy woman who has fantasies of an unrequited love, he uses those fantasies to seduce her - a scene at Christmas, floating on a moving sea of wrapping paper, she loses him momentarily.
She routinely has affairs, trying to recapture that feeling of a perfect love.
They have sex, each thinking of others they want to be with.
Truth is losing. Losing out to fantasy and delusional belief systems.



You used to be someone who didn't care about money. Remember those conversations we had, late in the lab, of doing great work, helping others, Jonas Salk, you know?
The world isn't as black and white as we thought when we were undergrads.
We help people. You can't say we don't help others doing what we do. And I make enough money 
now to help my parents now. How is that not a good thing? Its only a good thing.
different. Something slipped in along with all those good intentions. Something cynical and ugly.
I feel like everyone who used to be on my side has abandoned me, one by one, and I'm alone.
It's called growing up.
The world is much bigger than we knew back then. We were just kids.
I feel alone.
Elementary school, one boy started and whoever he tagged had to hold his hand so they 
formed a human chain, and the chain reached out and tagged others and slowly the chain grew, link by link, and 
before long it was this long swaying thing, undulating with the kids faces laughing, and soon only she was left. 
But it was coming for her too. And it did.

Impatience, agitation with others. Blaming others for his problems.

They encourage you with their words but their eyes are uninterested. But as soon as you talk of money, of the prospect 
of making a profit, their eyes light up, their voices jump an octave. Then you see what moves them, truly. You see then what stirs their souls.

Sick boy pulling a barrel full of trash. He is sick so having a hard time. He has a snake growing out of his forehead, it curls around his head and neck, very slowly it slithers out, as it comes it covers more and more of his face.

A scene where they meet in a luxurious shopping center. He feels unclean. Is greeted with some insincere corporate speak.

Welcome to Avalon, we're having a wonderful day, let us know how we can bring some joy to your life!

Fuck you.

Revenge on Carols new boyfriend. Works at a shop, compels him to do something that gets him fired, or worse? This ties into the man he murders later on, feels compelled to do it...

Smoked a foil

Man he kills is step father

After being told that his life is not his own, the evil he's done is not his concern. Do not worry, it was not you. But that was a lie.

He eats the man, like a drug-induced psychotic episode

oman sex - I hate my life

mother is with them while flying the kite

snake trump -> gay trump -> compassionate trump

he brings gifts and leaves them at the door. he receives a note? talks to ex? you don't get to do that anymore. you don't have the right. receives them, burned.

they were controlling him the whole time, manipulating him to locate her

he grows more paranoid, more agitated, less hungry, as time goes by
^^^ as a meth addict

bites nails, covers pot belly with arm

why is this happening to me?

  can I go?
  will he hurt me?

  will he hurt kurt?

he destroys step dads new truck, later sees it at house, leaving gifts

finds cell phone, they left it open to his text, they text him to make a deal

killing the stepfather gives them leverage over him, entrapping him to work for them

we never needed the computer, we just needed an innocent set of eyes on the data, a level of indirection, 
to lead us to her. We thought it would be those tweakers we hired, just bad luck it was you.

I ain't innocent.
To Zoe you were.

We used to talk about important things. How we were going to change the world. What happened? When did we lose that? 
When did it become about money? Life happened. I'm married now. I have two girls. Do you know how expensive private school is?

This technology should be free. This is a tool for communication. It will change things. It will change the world. There's 
nothing wrong with making money.

at the house, her childhood home, he murders then eats, a fire, he runs away, burned, hides in the woods, like an animal

I done it for the money. I can't ever go out in the sunlight, like I used to done. My lifes ruint.

Shit was straight. That's why we stick with you. Your shit be real and your bags aint stingy neither. Not like those other 
assholes. You be too quiet though, damn.
Shut the fuck up, Jenn.
Don't tell me Grady. He know I just playin. You don't own me.

A dream to go square, straighten up.

Feeling the drain.

Recop, buy another batch.

Behind the trailer in the woods, texts Grady, 'back door' - no response so he knocks, feels for the key and finds one, finds them 
shot on the couch, phone missing, then gets a text, 'we just want the notebook' and then 'stay put' He doesn't.
is chased through the woods by shadow people, they call his phone, he turns off, brandishes gun, then they're just gone. back at hotel, he memorizes number and gives it to the homeless guy who puts it in his cart.

don't have scenes of character development and plot action, integrate

notes.doc

you have to write detail of the settings as if its exotic, as if its completely foreign and strange.

to get out of the room, being watched, he calls 911 with reports of a fire and injuries. When the chaos of firetrucks and ambulances arrive he makes his escape around the building.

Do not distrub

Gets text message from The Bitch

Do you still have the notebook? we need to get it back, for real. $ is no issue, hit me back, bro.

computer comes in bag along with first gen headset

sex with woman is forced with mind, gets idea from that to harm husband, when drunk

walks through a birthday party in the past, their home zoey is a child, she says find me Mr. Will, Josey is there. Suzanne

Where?
she notes a visitor from government, the former director of CIA.

Suzanne Bitch

I believe in you and I'm not the only one. Help me. Find me.

Calls firetruck but then escapes out the back, grabs the computer from the bin and is chased by the man in the shadows, ends up in a chase through the hospital, sir there is nobody here, sir there are no drugs here, runs to waffle house

You murdered them, Grady and Jenn

And you sold drugs to Grady and Jenn, long before we ever met, and maybe you were afraid to get caught with the computer at their botched robbery so maybe you killed them. You definitely have it in you. You murdered Randall, after all. Are you beginning to understand how things really are? We control the narrative. We control you. You work for us. You will work for us. I know there is a part of you that wants to believe you are free. That you ultimately decide the way your life is. But that is't so. You are not free. You have never been free. More than that, you don't want to be free.

Who is us? Who are you? I don't get the big picture.
It doesn't matter who we are, or what you call us, the company, the government, the man, the 1%, we are those who make the decisions about how things will be and you are he who obeys.

eat shit and die

at the end he's burned, from the fire started in the house, after chewing off the face of Randall, like the victim of a meth lab explosion

The rich woman ran her can head on into traffic, she died on the side of the highway - he is told this by the administrator, it mirrors the fantasy vision of DT

The Wizard of Oz playing on the TV, at Grady and Jenns

Fast as Fuck = high on meth

Climbs in through the kids old room, dust on the toys, her baby taken away

Grady and Jenn are mutilated, not shot

Password is address to house, he discovers on photo of birthday party

After the escape with notebook, through the emergency room, he hides out in a Waffle House

Figures out he needs device prototype for v2, in the charred remains of the research center. He goes there instead of meeting up with the people to sell the notebook, gets the prototype and communes with Zoey. He finally understands the device is for communication, not mind control. She tells him about how she discovered the two way stream, using an impression of the person via media. She chose to test with the person who revolted her most, DT - describes the fantasy world of DT, then the birthday party. Find me.

A shopping spree at Avalon, wild euphoria, spending, wrapping, floating on wrapping paper with the woman - culminating in controlling her to have sex. I hate my life.

You're not a good person. That is true. But you don't have to be. You have no need to feel guilt anymore. It's OK. Morality is a human invention. It has outlived its usefulness for control, we have better tools. We have technology. Be who you are. Do not be ashamed.

The mutilators. The desecrators.

In the GE plant, am I really here? I don't know if I'm here. Well you tell me? But I don't know. Then what difference does it make.
Don't say things like that. Like what? Like killin don't matter. Well it doesn't. Folks don't talk like this. This is a movie. I'm afraid not. This is our new world, a world of the Aura stream, properly moderated of course, properly calibrated, we don't want to hurt anyone, after all. You're full of shit. I can't understand you.

Whoever finds this note, I need your help. Find me.

When he joins her aura stream he sees a memory from here childhood, the dilapidated house (Quail Hollow), walks around in the aura until he finds something to help locate her. When he goes there the place is empty, though there are clues she was there. Here is where he is attacked and devours the man.

She built the prototype into a knitted pink beanie with cat ears, to keep the men in the lab away from it.

The woman he has sex with he sees walking through Avalon.

Each exploitive act must tie back to family somehow, or a corruption of it. Hence, the boy in the hotel room is the juggalo's son, the woman handcuffed his mother.

something was lost, not fast, over years of time - something was forgotten

With his skin burned he cannot stand to be in the sunlight

When he drops off the presents, sees his son through the window playing, wants to keep the moment, to have it, not like a memory, but the moment itself. They touch hands through the glass...

Tries to destroy his life, the stepfather.

Woman is a lost love, plants a seed in her brain

Beat by beat description of her thoughts as they have sex, betraying her husband. His attraction to her breasts, lips, togetherness. 

Panic when over, she dries away, distraught.

His life as it was held together by whatever strength he had, even the mess of it now, he felt it took energy just to maintain, to pay the rent of the hotel, his cell phone bill, sometimes just the energy of those things was almost too much to bear. So to get back again to the place he used to be, to have the things he had, that seemed like an insurmountable wall.

In the wilderness I will wait for you.

He saw himself like a beast with a thousand arms, each one reaching out to hold his reality together, this arm paid the hotel bill each month, this one the cell phone bill, this one handled the recop whenever he ran dry. And it was too much sometimes. And all it would take for his entire reality to unravel would be to let go, to stop giving a shit. That's all it would take.

Device is at campus lab, in a pink toboggan, he retrieves it. More shadow people. Juggalo Joe returns, they fight, makes a deal. Pays off Rodriguez. Fucks with mechanic, ruins his new red truck, learning he can control others, follows him home, to family dinner, he weeps.

After dizziness, headache, dilated pupils.

Woman at Avalon he controls her to buy gifts for his family, becomes a date, she is euphoric, they have sex behind a dumpster

Needs a new vehicle after escape, passes by a beautiful red Tacoma in a builders supply parking lot. Stops and watches for the owner to come out, he learns where he hid the keys and waits for a chance to steal it. But something stops him, the man comes out, chases him away, without seeing him. He is angry, focuses on the man and causes him to hurt himself. Causes another man to run into the truck with a fork lift...follows him home...

Makes a deal to trade the device and computer for 1 million. Before he goes he discovers v2, which works with only media of the subject. He tries it with Zoey and learns she’s alive (bday party) and that the real purpose of the technology is communication. They join...dream of DT, her family, what happened before the fire. Find me she says.

feel like begotten, handmade, earthen

find me, on the cake at the party

help me, elsewhere

Store clerk badgers, man is irritated, woman slaps

Need a document of the first experiment

Father, what Zoey says to him

Unknown the woman and girl relationship to him. Daddy, the girl came out of the room, mommy’s crying. He took the distraction and picked up the phone book and knocked the knife blade

He handed the blanket to Joseph to carry to the only clear spot in the field, the rest covered in tall, green grass. Suzanne carried the picnic basket, while he fussed with the kite.

Can I have your pickle? Boy you gonna turn into a pickle one of these days.

He nestled his head on her chest.

You make a good pillow.

Mmm, and you are a good blanket.

Things with woman turns into a date, they eat gelato, rent an expensive room, make love...

Here I am. Here I am. I was always here. And I always will be.

Like being at the bottom of the ocean, walking through water.

Do you understand? Tell me that you understand.

All the workers stop and turn to face him. Their eyes blank, expectant.

I do understand.

They forgot to have her sign document that gives them right to IP, leads to argument with director. She knows him from college.

First letters is all about how it came to be, significance, shouting from rooftops

Second communion is about betrayal

This is bigger than us, this is important. It deserves to be given to people. It could change things, forever.

That’s just my concern. We don’t understand this and it could very well change things. It’s irresponsible to make this technology available to the public at large. I mean Zoey look, this could disrupt all the systems modern civilization is built upon. I hate to say things that make me sound like a comic book supervillian but that’s what we’re talking about here. 

Maybe all the systems of modern civilization need disrupting.
Oh grow up, you still sound like a rebellious teenager, against the man. The world isn’t that way.

It’s like once the pattern had been establish it’s available to me, the channel is unblocked. It could happen for everyone.

Where do you want me to come, sir?
Do it in me, baby.

Poverty, patience, assurance, and austerity: all good qualities for your writing to have.
Also humility

The underwater, slow-moving experience is temporary, like your eyes adjusting to sunlight. People also resemble their natures?

This shit right here, this will kill you. Deader than hell. It robs you of your life. Of your children. It don’t care. It will take it all from you.

Will pulls gun when Grady reaches into bag

With the woman in a department store the floor opens and there is a lake filled with coral and fish and clear water...they swim together

But you know the truth, Will, don’t you? Say it.
I am not free.
You have never been free.

A derelict warming his hands under the dryer ventilation

An interruption in the library, a bookish woman asking for a chair he has his foot propped on, he tells her he needs it. Fuck. Off.

I’m not free. I’ve never been free.

we forgive you

You oughta be ashamed to sell this to folks, it’s devilish. It’s not Godly.
Jenn, shut the fuck up.
I’m just saying, that’s all.
Three hundred.

Eat your own pickle
I already did
Boy you gonna turn into a pickle
No I ain’t daddy
Go on then...

I don’t have no filter. I tell it like it is.

The lambswool footmats, he placed his hand upon, soft, and there were tears and he knew those tears were for those who would never know this kind of excellence.

Date with woman should be like a dream, they walk through a cavern with jewels alive, they float down a stairs made from parachute material, they eat at a buffet with strange foods.

He doesn’t get money from juggalo, beaten up instead...

Funded by a consortium of technology leaders: Facebook, Amazon, Google, Apple, Microsoft. They all stand to gain by having a finger in this pie.

Fucking bean counters, making all the decisions.
Those bean counters pay your salary.

I don’t know, something has been lost here. People don’t dream anymore. Or rather we do have dreams but they must conform to parameters defined by the powers that be. Our dreams are caged in, limited by parameters of some program.

It’s like you never grew up. I’m not the bad guy. Im trying to put my kids through school, to be the best provider I can be for them. You’ll understand that one day.

There's an unspoken idea around here that only things which have the potential to make money are worth spending time on. I reject that. 

In fact I believe its really the other way around. It didn't used to be this way. What happened to you?

I want to do great things. To push against the limits of human understanding. But all we are focused on is how to speed up the transfer of money from this person's pocket into this other person's pocket. I feel boxed in, limited. It trivializes everything it touches, makes it mundane, of the world.

If I have to see another guy in a blue button down and pressed khakis I'm going to jump off this building. I swear to God. The market. That look of empty-headed rapture in all the corporate photos. Those blank smiles, empty eyes.
Where did you leave your unicorn? This relentless positivity, Jesus Christ. You are like zombies of positive thinking...

Thanks for all you’ve done.

No problem, it was my pleasure!

Woman before date, after shopping

You know what we need you to know, when we need you to know it. Just as you controlled the minds of others we were also controlling you.

What about the bodies? Grady and Jenn, Zoey, what do police know? The bodies were never recovered. They know nothing.

Give me the fucking pen!

Hides in library overnight, sleeps

Im sorry, for what I did.

You are loved. You will be loved. You have been loved.

What have I done?

Get your hands off her, don’t you dare move her!

You are loved. You are loved.

Everything is forgiven. Everything is forgiven.

They spend the night in a fancy hotel, she wakes up, is horrified, stumbles out the door. 'What did I do? What have I done?' He watches her leave in the parking lot, swiping another car, running through a median.

What is project Aura?

As reported by one of our test subjects who was approached by you last week, under the radar, so it seems. And why have you been using facilities after hours, unauthorized? Please see me when you get this. Mike

The computer should contain information about project aura, what it is about in vague terms, but also about zoeys character, rebellious, angry...

You're the one I want. You make me happy.

I love you Suzanne. I love you always.

Sees his son older, missed time

Chat log from dating site, PinkHatGirl, talks about being a visualization programmer, a way to explain in layman’s terms what she does

I don’t love money, I love freedom, opportunity, why is that wrong?

this was different.

Start with how it’s different, not direct communication, free access to her being and she had free access to his, she saw the things he had done but he did not feel judged, she is able to guide his focus, and she shows him the story of how she discovered the technology, and how she tested it and the breakthrough which led to it becoming a one-way tool to a two-way communication tool, what her vision of the future is. That the device is only an amplifier to something dormant within us. Once awoken the device will not be necessary. But then reality as she introduced it to Richard, the corporate stranglehold and difference of vision, ending with her fleeing the night Grady and Jenn broke into the facility. Birthday party, Help Me...

As he stares at ceiling he thinks about tendrils holding him to life

Don’t you feel the walls closing in, the need of money becomes the want of money, the want of money becomes the desire, the desire becomes the obsession, and the obsession leaves no room for the things in life which are truly good, selfless love and pure creativity, things which have no utility except that they stir our imaginations, our souls, and show us glimpses of the world as it could be.
pursuits which have no utility

baby carriage instead of a shopping cart

We no longer follow interests from the wellspring of our hearts, but instead what can give us the largest ROI. Why does this matter?

Write that novel, paint that picture, build that crazy statue

For these things I weep; mine eye, mine eye runneth down with water, because the comforter that should relieve my soul is far from me: my children are desolate, because the enemy prevailed.
Lamentations 1:16

I do not understand how they live or what feeds their souls

Strengthen Zoeys refusal to acknowledge their claim to the technology. This is bigger than IP, NDAs. Then bring up Jonas Salk.

The anger of the book is not against business or entrepreneurism, it’s against betraying a dream for something smaller, trading God for mammon.

A psychedelic, science fiction, mystery thriller set in the rural south...

You a lie! Jenn (about computer)

The only way it can work is if it’s free to all, that is the only way to prevent exploitation, to use it as a tool for control. That was the only way.

She understands her line of thought leads to control, but decides it must be that way, the risk of it that is

extremely high spatial and temporal resolution can be achieved with a noninvasive array of nodes, it is also resistant to ambient interference

Fearful of him. Of what he might do. He heard it in their stilted hellos. Saw it in their eyes that would not look at him. Saw it in their eyes that would not meet his.

Goddamn tennis ball stuffed in the broken tail light housing, painted red, like he’s fooling somebody.

Suzanne pinched him.
Woman!
Hey, that what happens. I see a cute tush, I pinch.

He thought about Joseph and if he would ever remember him...

As they lay he listens to the distant going by on Highway 27. He heard the mountain bikers return and pack up, but was too lazy to move to look at them. He opens his eyes and sees his son playing with some blades of grass, braiding them in some fashion around a twig. 

Angel of mine, he thought, and his heart swelled with an overwhelming tenderness towards his boy and he thought he might cry. Somewhere in the back of his mind a voice laughed at him, a younger, more immature version of himself. He didn’t care.

Hey, I see a cheek I pinch.

On the levels of phrase, sentence, paragraph, scene, chapter, book, make sure each proceeds logically from the one before. Doing this provides a sense of continuity and helps guide the reader through the story without feeling disoriented. To say another way, you may confuse the reader if the all the components of your story do not follow logically one from the other.

We used to dream about...now we dream of Roth IRAs and how to maximize our returns for the short to medium terms.

You can’t own this, any more than you can own photosynthesis or ...

We used to dream about inventing a vaccine that would save a hundred million lives, now we dream about how to maximize the annual return percentage of our Roth IRAs. We used to dream about making music that would move people to tears from its melody alone, now we dream about getting the best rate on our fixed thirty year mortgage...

...now we dream of ways to raise our Equifax credit score.

Behind an old strip mall, where the Krogers used to be, where he liked to meet up with folks this side of town, he waited.

The song popped into his head every now and then, at the weirdest of times, in a gas station buying cigarettes, at the dump tossing bags of trash, and he always had to laugh. It just wasn’t the way it was. Not no more.
