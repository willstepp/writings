REVISION 1


Prologue
========================================
*) Read chapter quiet, then read aloud
*) Make notes about what works and doesn't work on a story level, then ideas for improvement
*) Come up with ideas where chapter can be expanded by 1500 words (adding new content|deepening what exists)

  Descriptions are weak, not evocative enough. Prose awkward. Dialogue is a bit stilted in places, maybe too much 
  back and forth that doesn't need to be there. Pull back on the descriptions of him kissing his wife. 
  Do a better job of establishing the relaxed and dreamy mood towards the end. Maybe add content in the 
  form of more dialogue, better descriptions. Don't need to add anymore scenes. Perhaps expand the tension 
  when searching for his son. Focus the end of the chapter more on him holding his son, only mentioning the 
  strawberry pies in the closing narrative, don't end the action there.

-) Rewrite chapter, implementing new ideas, fixing old story problems, prose and grammar issues
