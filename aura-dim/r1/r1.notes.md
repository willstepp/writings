Prologue
========================================
*) Read chapter quiet, then read aloud
*) Make notes about what works and doesn't work on a story level, then ideas for improvement
*) Come up with ideas where chapter can be expanded by 1500 words (adding new content|deepening what exists)

  Tailgate down I pulled out the ratty quilt and tossed it to my son who took off in a sprint towards the field.
  "Joseph!", his mother yelled from inside the cab, "Boy, don't drag my good picnic blanket through the dirt!"
  Two scrawny arms lifted it off the ground, barely, until he reached the grass edge.s
  
  Descriptions are weak, not evocative enough. Get rid of stupid phrasing like 'there was a tree', 'it was hot', make 
  things sensory instead, immediate. Prose awkward. Dialogue is stilted in places, maybe too much back and forth that 
  doesn't need to be there. Pull back on the descriptions of him kissing his wife. 
  Do a better job of establishing the relaxed and dreamy mood towards the end. Maybe add content in the 
  form of more dialogue, better descriptions. Don't need anymore scenes. Perhaps expand the tension 
  when searching for his son. Focus the end of the chapter more on him holding his son, only mentioning the 
  strawberry pies in the closing narrative, don't end the action there.
