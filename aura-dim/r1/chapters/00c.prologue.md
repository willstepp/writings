 
Prologue

  Tailgate down, I fished out the ratty old blanket and tossed it to my son, who took off in a sprint towards the field.
  "Joseph!", his mother hollered from inside the cab, "Dont be draggin my picnic quilt through the dirt, kiddo!"
	Two scrawny arms managed to lift the blanket off the ground, barely, until he reached the grass edge. Suzanne got out of the truck and lit a cigarette as she came around to the back.
	"Baby, hand me that basket of food and the sweet tea." 
	I did so.
	"And them Solo cups too, behind the toolbox."
	But as I bent over to reach the cups I felt a sharp pinch.
	"Watch it woman." 
	I handed her the cups and she gave me this shit-eating grin and trotted off across the parking area, working those jean shorts like she knew how to, tossing me a sly glance over her shoulder.
	"Bring the ice when you come, baby please."
	On the way there we had stopped at the Dollar General for drinks and Joseph spotted a kite in a little kiosk next to the register. He begged me to buy one for him and picked out this rainbow-colored number, shaped like a butterfly. Now I unfurled the contents onto the bed of the truck. From memory I tried to remember how to slot the right pole into the right hole, but it had been years since I had put together machinery this complex, apparently, and failed. Eventually I read the instructions and a few minutes after that was walking towards the field, kite in hand, where Suzanne was laying out the food. She had laid out rotisserie chicken, buttered corn on the cob, potato salad, dill pickles, a loaf of white bread to make sandwiches, and fried strawberry pies from a local farm for dessert.
	Joseph tore through the grass to meet me, madman-faced, grabbing at the kite once he got close enough.
	"Now hold up a second, Hoss. Let me show you how to do it first. Theys a skill to flying a kite. If you dont hold it right, a boy your size, its liable to carry you plum over that mountain yonder."
	Incredulous. A toothy grin.
	"Will baby," Suzanne shouted, "did you bring the ice like I asked you to?"
	"Shit no."
	"I reminded you."
	"I know you did."
	"Then why didnt you bring it, grandpa?"
	"Get off my back, grandma."
	Minutes later I returned with the ice and found Joseph crawling on all fours through the tall grass, barking like a dog. Normally the field was mown by April but the county must have let it slip this year. The caterpillar-green blades went up to my knees, higher in some places. Gusts of wind blew gentle waves over the field, all the way to the road.
	I felt a tugging and looked down and saw Joseph Dog at my ankles, gnawing on my pants leg. When he saw me looking he raised up on his hind legs, tongue wagging, front paws begging.
	"Hey little doggy, you ready to fly this kite or what?"
	Excited nodding, rising to his feet.
	We walked to a clearing in the center of the field and I showed Joseph how to measure the direction of the wind by wetting my thumb and holding it up.
	"Now once you know which direction the wind is blowing, you want to turn your back to it, and hold up the kite so the sails catch the wind. Make sense?"
	A nod.
	I lifted the kite to show him what I meant and instantly the kite went taut, edges ruffling. Joseph hopped behind me, eyes wide, surprised at the force of the wind. I chuckled.
	"Oh yeah, that's what you want to see. Boy I tell you what!"
	Joseph emerged from behind me, fascinated.
	"From here on out, you gotta make sure you hold onto the spool, like this."
	I grasped the plastic spool handle and unwound five loops and let them hang in my free hand.
	"You want just enough line loose so that the kite has enough slack to get into the air and then stay there by itself. But not any more than that. Not yet."
	With that explanation I heaved the kite into the air and immediately it caught an updraft and flew backwards with strength. I let out the slack and held the spool with both hands. The line went sharp.
	Rainbow butterfly against the blue sky, bobbing, fluttering.
	At last I figured it was steady enough to hand off to Joseph so I motioned for him to come over. He looked nervous but took the spool with both hands.
	"Hold on tight."
	"I will."
	A look of deep concentration on his face. Joy.
	"This is incredible!"
	Minutes passed. Flying by himself, figuring out how to walk backwards in order to keep the line taut, how to take up slack on the spool.
	"What do you say we let it go even higher?" I asked him.
	"Yeah!"
	I showed him how to unwind the spool one loop at a time while keeping the kite afloat. Joseph studied my hand movements intently. I unspooled about ten loops, eyes on the kite. It went higher, a small triangle of color amidst the blue. The force of the wind tugged on the spool. I made sure the line wouldn't dig into his hand.
	"Its almost in outer space!"
	He laughed.
	"Sure is."
	We flew for half an hour, eventually so far from our picnic blanket we had to look for it. I showed him how to wind the line back onto the spool when the wind died down. Once, the kite dove sharply into a free fall. I tried to save it by pulling back and  winding the line but it was no use. The rainbow butterfly crashed nose first into the grass. Joseph ran over and held up the broken pieces.
	"No worries," I assured him, "We'll get her patched up and good as new again."
	About that time Suzanne called out from the picnic blanket, her voice echoing off the woods edge.
	"Ding, ding, boys, come and get it!"
	I collected the remains of the kite and tousled his hair, telling him not to look so glum. We returned together and Joseph interrupted his mother's attempt to hand him a plate several times to tell her all about how to fly a kite. Finally he finished and she handed him his plate and a cup of sweet iced tea. Instantly he downed the sweet tea, brushed the sweaty hair from his eyes, and pushed the cup towards his mother for more.
	"You can have more tea, but you need to eat too. Eat some of that chicken sandwich I made you."
	He lifted the bread suspiciously.
	"Theres no mayonnaise on it. I promise."
	I took a bite of my own sandwich.
	"Hell it dont need mayo," I observed, "This birds nice and juicy."
	We ate together, not speaking, basking in the rays of the early afternoon sunshine. Joseph broke the silence at last.
	"Daddy, can I have your pickle?"
	"Eat your own pickle," I said.
	"I already ate mine."
	"You already ate yours?"
	"Yeah."
	"Let me see."
	He showed me his plate. Chicken sandwich. Potato salad. No pickle.
	"Boy you gonna turn into a pickle one of these days."
	Laughter.
	"No I aint daddy!"
	"Alright. Go on then."
	I held out my plate to him. He snatched the pickle and shoved it into his mouth. Suzanne and I exchanged looks.
	"Oh no, Suzanne!" I said, wide-eyed, clapping both hands against my cheeks, "Look at Joseph. Oh my God he's turnin green. He's turnin into a pickle!"
	"Oh no!"
	A frown. Looking himself over. Then a smile.
	"I aint a pickle!"
	"Oh yes you are, and now I get to eat you!"
	I grabbed him under the legs and swung him up and pretended to munch on him. Then I lifted his shirt and blew fart noises on his belly and he giggled uncontrollably while trying to wiggle free. Suzanne and me both caught his laughter and it went on for awhile until finally I set him down and collapsed against my wife, who lay propped up on one arm. Joseph crawled next to me and lay against my belly. And we caught our breath.
	For some time after there was only the sound of the wind blowing over the grass and through the high branches of the pine trees. Birdsong overhead. Hikers emerged from the trailhead near the parking area and we heard their distant chatter and then the hum of an engine and then a car driving off. Against her bosom I felt her heartbeat, steady and slow. Her free hand feathered my hair as if in meditation. She pulled the loose strands behind my ears and smoothed it down in one continuous motion.
	"I need a haircut."
	"Your hair is perfect."
	"That ain't true, I got a bald spot."
	"Your bald spot is perfect."
	I leaned up and kissed her neck. She kissed my forehead. When we opened our eyes Joseph was watching us. He said nothing and then scooted to the edge of the blanket where he began pulling grass blades out of the ground and piled them up with an intensity of play that only a child can have, as if it was his own quiet work. Some time later he spoke, just as I was drifting off.
	"Daddy?"
	"Yeah?"
	"Remember when we were flying the kite?"
	"Yeah."
	"No. Remember when we were flying the kite and I said it was almost in outer space?"
	"I do."
	"Can that happen for real?"
	"A kite in outer space?"
	"Yeah."
	"Well sure."
	Joseph lay back on the blanket and looked up and I knew he was imagining that kite flying into outer space. Beyond the field. Beyond the clouds. Up it flew. Up into that part of the atmosphere where the air becomes thin and cold. The stratosphere. Beyond the stratosphere. Beyond where birds can fly. Where only manmade ships can fly. Then beyond that. Stars visible. And Planets. The planets and stars of our galaxy. Our cheap plastic rainbow butterfly kite beyond the boundary of the Earth against a backdrop of planets and stars and the darkness of the universe.
	"Where does it go then?"
	"What do you mean?"
	"After space."
	"There aint no after space."
	"I dont understand that."
	"Space goes on forever."
	"Forever."
	"Thats right."
	"How far is that?"
	"Very."
	"Can people go there?"
	"No."
	"Then how do you know how far it is?"
	"We have machines that tell us."
	"And the machines can see forever?"
	"No."
	"Oh. Then how do the machines know?"
	"I dont know, Joseph. Ask your mama."
	But she was asleep. And then so was I.
