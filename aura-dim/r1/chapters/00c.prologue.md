 
Prologue

  Tailgate down I fished out the ratty old quilt and tossed it to my son, who took off in a sprint towards the field.
	"Joseph!", his mother hollered from inside the cab, "Don't be draggin my picnic blanket through the dirt, kiddo!"
	Two scrawny arms lifted the quilt off the ground, barely, until he reached the grass. Suzanne got out of the truck and lit a cigarette as she came around to the back.
	"Baby, hand me that basket of food and the sweet tea." 
	I did so. 
	"And them solo cups too, behind the toolbox."
	But as I bent over to reach the cups I felt a sharp pinch.
	"Watch it, woman." 
	Then I handed her the cups and she gave me this shit-eating grin and trotted off across the parking area, working those jean shorts like she knew how to, tossing me a sly glance over her shoulder.
	"Bring the ice when you come, baby please."
	On the way we had stopped at the Dollar General for drinks and Joseph spotted a kite in a little kiosk next to the register. He begged me to get one and he picked out this rainbow-colored one, shaped like a butterfly. Now I unfurled the contents onto the bed of the truck. From memory I tried to remember how to slot the right pole into the right hole, but it had been years since I had assembled machinery this complex, apparently, and failed. Eventually I swallowed my pride and read the instructions and a few minutes later headed towards the field where Suzanne was laying out the food - a rotisserie chicken, buttered corn on the cob, potato salad, dill pickles, a loaf of white bread to make sandwiches, and fried strawberry pies from a local farm for dessert.
	Joseph ran to meet me with a wild look in his eyes, grabbing at the kite once he got close enough.
	"Now hold up a second, Hoss. Let me show you how to do it first. They's a skill to flying a kite. If you don't hold it right, a boy your size, its liable to carry you plum over that mountain yonder."
	Incredulous eyes, a toothy grin.
	"Will baby," Suzanne shouted, "did you bring the ice like I asked you to?"
	"Shit no."
	"I reminded you to bring it."
	"I know you did."
	"Then why didn't you remember the ice, grandpa?"
	"Get off my back, grandma."
	Minutes later I returned with the ice and found Joseph crawling on all fours through the tall grass, barking like a dog. Normally the field was mown by April but the county must have let it slip this year. The caterpillar-green blades went up to my knees, higher in some places. Gusts of wind blew gentle waves over the field, all the way to the road.
	I felt a tugging and looked down and saw Dog Joseph at my ankles, gnawing on my pants leg. When he saw me looking he raised up on his hind legs, tongue wagging, front paws begging.
	"Hey little doggy, you ready to fly this kite or what?"
	Excited nodding, rising to his feet.
	We walked to a clearing in the center of the field and I showed Joseph how to measure the direction of the wind by wetting my thumb and holding it up.
	"Now once you know which direction the wind is blowing, you want to turn your back to it, and hold up the kite so the sails catch the wind. Make sense?"
	Nodding.
	I lifted the kite to show him what I meant and instantly the kite went taut, edges ruffling. Joseph hopped behind me, eyes wide, surprised at the force of the wind. I chuckled.
	"Oh yeah! That's what you want to see. Look at that, boy howdy!"
	Joseph emerged from behind me, fascinated.
	"From here on out, you gotta make sure you hold onto the spool, like this."
	I grasped the plastic spool handle and unwound five loops and let them hang in my free hand.
	"You want just enough line loose so that the kite has enough slack to get into the air and then stay there by itself. But not any more than that. Not yet."
	With that final explaination I heaved the kite into the air and immediately it caught an updraft and flew backwards with strength. I let out the slack loops and held the spool with both hands. The line went tight.
	Rainbow butterfly against the blue sky, bobbing, fluttering.
	At last I figured it was steady enough to hand off to Joseph so I motioned for him to come over. He looked nervous but took the spool with both hands.
	"Hold on tight."
	"I will."
	A look of deep concentration on his face. Joy.
	"This is incredible!"
	Minutes passed. Flying by himself, figuring out how to walk backwards in order to keep the line taut, how to take up slack on the spool.
	"What do you say we let it go even higher!" I asked him.
	"Yeah!"
	I showed him how to unwind the spool one loop at a time while keeping the kite afloat. Joseph studied my hand movements intently. I unspooled about ten loops, eyes always on the kite. Imperceptibly it went higher, a small triangle of color amidst the blue. The force of the wind tugged on the spool. I made sure the line wouldn't dig into his hand.
	"That kite is almost in outer space!"
	He laughed.
	"Sure is," I agreed.
	We flew for half an hour, eventually so far from our picnic blanket we had to look for it. I showed him how to wind the line back onto the spool when the wind died down. Once, the kite dove sharply into a free fall. I tried to save it by pulling back and  winding the line but it was of no use. It crashed nose first into the grass. Joseph ran to it and held up the broken pieces.
	"It's alright," I assured him, "we'll get her patched up and good as new."
