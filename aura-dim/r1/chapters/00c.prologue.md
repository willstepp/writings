 
Prologue

  Tailgate down, I fished out the ratty blanket and tossed it to my boy, who took off in a sprint towards the field.
  "Joseph!", his mother hollered from inside the cab, "Don't be draggin my picnic quilt through the dirt, kiddo!"
	Two scrawny arms managed to lift the blanket off the ground, barely, until he reached the grass. 
	Suzanne got out of the truck and lit a cigarette as she came around to the back.
	"Baby, hand me that basket of food and the sweet tea." 
	I did so.
	"And them Solo cups too, behind the toolbox there."
	As I bent over to reach the cups I felt a sharp pinch in my nether regions.
	"Watch it woman." 
	I handed her the sleeve and she gave me this shit-eating grin and trotted off across the parking area, working those jean shorts like she knew how to, tossing me a sly glance over her shoulder, "Bring the ice when you come, baby please."
	On the way there we had stopped at the Dollar General for plates and utensils and Joseph spotted a kite in a little kiosk next to the register. He begged me to buy one for him and picked out this rainbow-colored number, shaped like a butterfly. Now I unfurled the contents onto the bed of the truck. From memory I tried to remember how to slot the right pole into the right hole, but it had been years since I had put together machinery this complex, apparently, and failed. Eventually I read the instructions and a few minutes after that was walking towards the field, kite in hand, where Suzanne was laying out the food, a cornucopia of rotisserie chicken, buttered corn on the cob, potato salad, dill pickles, white bread for sandwiches, and for dessert fried strawberry pies from a local farm.
	Joseph tore through the grass to meet me, face like a madman, grabbing at the kite once he got close enough.
	"Now hold up a second, Hoss. Let me show you how to do it first. They's a skill to flying a kite. If you don't hold it right, a boy your size, its liable to carry you plum over that mountain yonder."
	Incredulous. A toothy grin.
	"Will baby," Suzanne shouted, "did you bring the ice like I asked you to?"
	"Shit no."
	"I reminded you."
	"I know you did."
	"Then why didn't you bring it, grandpa?"
	"Get off my back, grandma."
	Minutes later I returned with the ice and found Joseph crawling on all fours through the tall grass, barking like a dog. Normally the field was mown by April but the county must have let it slip this year. The caterpillar-green blades went up to my knees, higher in some places. Gusts of wind blew gentle waves over the field, all the way to the road.
	I felt a tugging and looked down and saw Joseph Dog at my ankles, gnawing on my pants leg. When he saw me looking he raised up on his hind legs, tongue wagging, front paws begging.
	"Hey little doggy, you ready to fly this kite or what?"
	Excited nodding, rising to his feet.
	We walked to a clearing in the center of the field and I showed Joseph how to measure the direction of the wind by wetting my thumb and holding it up.
	"Now once you know which direction the wind is blowing, you want to turn your back to it, and hold up the kite so the sails catch the wind. Make sense?"
	A nod.
	I lifted the kite to show him what I meant and instantly the kite went taut, edges ruffling. Joseph hopped behind me, eyes wide, surprised at the force of the wind. I chuckled.
	"Oh yeah, that's what you want to see. Boy I tell you what!"
	Joseph emerged from behind me, fascinated.
	"From here on out, you gotta make sure you hold onto the spool, like this."
	I grasped the plastic spool handle and unwound five loops and let them hang in my free hand.
	"You want just enough line loose so that the kite has enough slack to get into the air and then stay there by itself. But not any more than that. Not yet."
	With that explanation I heaved the kite into the air and immediately it caught an updraft and flew backwards with strength. I let out the slack and held the spool with both hands. The line went sharp.
	Rainbow butterfly against the blue sky, bobbing, fluttering.
	At last I figured it was steady enough to hand off to Joseph so I motioned for him to come over. He looked nervous but took the spool with both hands.
	"Hold on tight."
	"I will."
	A look of deep concentration on his face. Joy.
	"This is incredible!"
	Minutes passed. Flying by himself, figuring out how to walk backwards in order to keep the line taut, how to take up slack on the spool.
	"What do you say we let it go even higher?" I asked him.
	"Yeah!"
	I showed him how to unwind the spool one loop at a time while keeping the kite afloat. Joseph studied my hand movements intently. I unspooled about ten loops, eyes on the kite. It went higher, a small triangle of color amidst the blue. The force of the wind tugged on the spool. I made sure the line wouldn't dig into his hand.
	"Its almost in outer space!"
	He laughed.
	"Sure is."
	We flew for half an hour, eventually so far from our picnic blanket we had to look for it. I showed him how to wind the line back onto the spool when the wind died down. Once, the kite dove sharply into a free fall. I tried to save it by pulling back and  winding the line but it was no use. The rainbow butterfly crashed nose first into the grass. Joseph ran over and held up the broken pieces.
	"No worries," I assured him, "We'll get her patched up and good as new again."
	About that time Suzanne called out from the picnic blanket, her voice echoing off the woods edge.
	"Ding, ding, boys, come and get it!"
	I collected the remains of the kite and tousled his hair, telling him not to look so glum. We returned together and Joseph interrupted his mother's attempt to hand him a plate several times to tell her all about how to fly a kite. Finally he finished and she handed him his plate and a cup of sweet iced tea. Instantly he downed the sweet tea, brushed the sweaty hair from his eyes, and pushed the cup towards his mother for more.
	"You can have more tea, but you need to eat too. Eat some of that chicken sandwich I made you."
	He lifted the bread suspiciously.
	"Theres no mayonnaise on it. I promise."
	I took a bite of my own sandwich.
	"Hell it don't need mayo," I observed, "This here bird's nice and juicy."
	We ate together, not speaking, basking in the rays of the early afternoon sunshine. Joseph broke the silence at last.
	"Daddy, can I have your pickle?"
	"Eat your own pickle," I said.
	"I already ate mine."
	"You already ate yours?"
	"Yeah."
	"Let me see."
	He showed me his plate. Chicken sandwich. Potato salad. No pickle.
	"Boy you gonna turn into a pickle one of these days."
	Laughter.
	"No I aint daddy!"
	"Alright. Go on then."
	I held out my plate to him. He snatched the pickle and shoved it into his mouth. Suzanne and I exchanged looks.
	"Oh no, Suzanne!" I said, wide-eyed, clapping both hands against my cheeks, "Look at Joseph. Oh my God he's turnin green. He's turnin into a pickle!"
	"Oh no!"
	A frown. Looking himself over. Then a smile.
	"I aint a pickle!"
	"Oh yes you are, and now I get to eat you!"
	I grabbed him under the legs and swung him up and pretended to munch on him. Then I lifted his shirt and blew fart noises on his belly and he giggled uncontrollably while trying to wiggle free. Suzanne and me both caught his laughter and it went on for awhile until finally I set him down and collapsed against my wife, who lay propped up on one arm. Joseph crawled next to me and lay against my belly. And we caught our breath.
	For some time after there was only the sound of the wind blowing over the grass and through the high branches of the pine trees. Birdsong overhead. Hikers emerged from the trailhead near the parking area and we heard their distant chatter and then the hum of an engine and then a car driving off. Against her bosom I felt her heartbeat, steady and slow. Her free hand feathered my hair as if in meditation. She pulled the loose strands behind my ears and smoothed it down in one continuous motion.
	"I need a haircut."
	"Your hair is perfect."
	"That ain't true. I got a bald spot."
	"Your bald spot is perfect."
	I leaned up and kissed her neck. She kissed my forehead. When we opened our eyes Joseph was watching us. He said nothing and then scooted to the edge of the blanket where he began pulling grass blades out of the ground and piled them up with an intensity of play that only a child can have, as if it was his own quiet work. Some time later he spoke, just as I was drifting off.
	"Daddy?"
	"Yeah?"
	"Remember when we were flying the kite?"
	"Yeah."
	"No. Remember when we were flying the kite and I said it was almost in outer space?"
	"I do."
	"Can that happen for real?"
	"A kite in outer space?"
	"Yeah."
	"Well sure."
	Joseph lay back on the blanket and looked up and I knew he was imagining the kite floating into outer space. I admired him while he admired the sky, his face that sublime mix of masculine and feminine features as only the face of a child can be. Like an angel carved out of marble. Angel of mine, I thought, and my heart swelled with an overwhelming tenderness towards him, so overwhelming I just about cried. And somewhere in the back of my mind somebody laughed at me, a younger, more immature version of myself. But I didn't give a damn. Then my eyes went up like his, beyond our picnic blanket, beyond the field and the surrounding forest. Beyond the wind and the clouds. Up our kite flew. Up into that part of the atmosphere where the air becomes thin and cold. The stratosphere. Beyond the stratosphere. Beyond where birds can fly. Where only manmade ships can fly. Then beyond that. Stars visible. And planets. Our cheap dollar store kite, a rainbow butterfly, floating beyond the boundary of the Earth against the backdrop of planets and stars and the darkness of the universe.
	"Daddy?"
	"Yeah?"
	"Where does it go then?"
	"What do you mean?"
	"After outer space."
	"There ain't no after outer space."
	"I don't understand that."
	"Outer space goes on forever."
	"Forever."
	"Thats right."
	"How far is that?"
	"Very."
	"Can people go there?"
	"No."
	"Then how do you know how far it is?"
	"We have machines that tell us."
	"And the machines can see forever?"
	"No."
	"Oh. Then how do the machines know?"
	"I don't know, Joseph. Ask your mama."
	But she was asleep. And then so was I. Or I must have been, because the next thing I remember was sensing the sunlight fade behind my eyelids and opening them to see a billowy cloud moving across the afternoon sky, obscuring the sun, and all the colors of everything turned muted as they do during an eclipse.
	My wife woke and wrapped her arm around my belly and pulled me closer.
	"Baby."
	"What?"
  "Them titties sure do make good pillows."
  "Thanks honey. That's sweet of you to say."
	Then Joseph was hovering over me.
  "Daddy."
  "Yes?"
  "I gotta pee."
  "Well go pee then."
  "Where should I go?"
  "By them trees, by the woods. Just walk over there and unzip, just make sure nobody sees your pecker."
  "Will."
  "What?"
  "Don't teach our son to say pecker."
	"Why not?"
	"Its uncouth."
	"I'll show you uncouth."
	I turned to face Suzanne and kissed her neck and behind her ears and placed my hand between her thighs and felt the warmth of her body heat. We kissed. Slow and long and hard. Our tongues entwined. I reached my hand up her shirt and felt her smooth skin, cupped her naked breasts. But we didn't allow our lust to progress too far and eventually lay on the blanket side by side, breathing deeply, in time.
	"Baby," she said, "we need a house."
	I knew that was coming. Our apartment was too small. Much too small to raise a family in. One bedroom, one bath. No yard. We had talked about having another baby, hopefully a girl this time, but it seemed impossible the way things were.
  "After we see what happens with these layoffs at the plant and I know I still got a job. It'll have to wait till then. You know that."
	She turned away from me.
	"I know."
	I thought about touching her back but hesitated.
	"I know you get tired of hearing that. I love you."
	Her head angled towards me.
	"I love you too."
	"You're a wonderful woman, you know that?"
	"Yes."
	I wrapped my arms around her waist and inched closer, pressing into her.
	"How about after we leave here we ride up Big Texas Valley and take a look at some of them properties for sale?"
	"Okay. I'd like that."
	"Man I hope that one piece of land is still for sale, the one with twenty acres and the woods with the creek running through it."
	"I know the one you like the best. The house on that property is too small."
	"But if we buy, we can expand the house. Think of all that land. It will be a great place for a boy to grow up."
	"Who's going to maintain that land, cut all that grass?"
	"We'll get cows."
	She laughed.
	"What do you know about cows?"
	"I'll get a tractor, like Mr. Gambel does."
	A quiet moment. Then she spoke.
	"It would be nice. We could have a big bonfire area, sit around it at night. Invite people over."
	"Now you're talking."
	We lay together and did not speak. I listened to the grass rustling in the wind and the buzzing of insects nearby. I nestled my face against her shoulder blades and kissed her back. She took one of my hands into hers and squeezed. I knew without saying anything that she was on the property now, we were both there, together, exploring the acreage, walking through the house, imagining what a future there would be like. Soon we were both asleep again or we must have been because I don't remember anything else after not even what I was dreaming about.
	A distant scream. Joseph. Far from them.
	Before awake fully I scrambled through the tall grass towards the woodline, hands cupped to my mouth.
	"Where are you son? Shout so I can find you. Joseph!"
	Behind me I heard Suzanne call out too.
	Another shout. Then crying, panicked and afraid. It hurt me deep inside to hear him like that. Then pangs of guilt went through me. I reached the edge of the woods where the brush was thick and overgrown. Without a thought I dove into a dense opening where kudzu blanketed the ground, feeling something stir out of the way in the undergrowth. I shouted back too my wife to stay in the clearing in case he wandered out. She stopped at the place I had entered with her arms crossed, looking fearful.
	It was impossible to hear anything over the stomping of my boots, so I stopped where I was, heartbeat pounding in my ears. His cries came again from my right and I took off in that direction. 
	The muted sunlight dimmed the further into the woods I went. My vision was a blur of branches and leaves and small trees in my path. I wanted so much to take away the fear that my son might be feeling. As I ran I called to him.
	"Joseph, Stay where you are, okay? I'm coming boy! It's going to be okay. Can you hear me?"
	No response. Only his crying. Louder now but still far. In my mind I cursed myself and begged the Lord for him to be alright. Fearsome images of rattlers, mountain lions, and black bears flashed in my mind's eye. Attacks I had heard or read about, victims poisoned to death by snakebite, blue and swollen in the face. And visceral bite wounds resembling roadkill on the side of the highway, unrecognizable masses of flesh and bone and blood. These are the things I saw. 
	Soon I reached the ruins of an old stone bridge. It broached a creekbed that fed into a lake that no longer existed. Here the trees thinned exposing a flat, cracked dirt bowl with dead reeds and fallen tree trunks filling the empty space. But this was not where Joseph was.
	More cries. I knew he must be up the creekbed somewhere and lucky for me it was easier to make my way through its winding and mostly open pathway than it was through the trees. And then I saw him. There was a small drop-off to my left and down at the bottom in the brambles was my son. He was caught in a tangle of briars and brush. My heart almost went out of chest when I saw him and I cried out.
	"Joseph." 
	He looked up the hill.
	"Daddy!"
	Then I shuffled down the hillside, careful not to stumble into the briars myself, and got as close as I could to him.
	"Joseph, don't move at all! Stay still so them thorns don't cut you."
