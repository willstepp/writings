 
 Prologue
 
 Tailgate down I fished out the ratty old blanket and tossed it to my boy who took off in a sprint towards the field.
  "Joseph!", his mother hollered from inside the cab, "Son, don't be draggin my picnic quilt through the dirt!"
  Two scrawny arms lifted the blanket off the ground, barely, until he reached the grass edge. Suzanne got out and lit a cigarette as she came around to the back of the truck, "Baby hand me that basket of food and the sweet tea." I did so. "And them solo cups too, behind the toolbox." As I leaned over to reach the cups I felt a sharp pinch on my behind. "Woman!" When I handed her the cups she just gave me this shit-eating grin and walked off across the parking area, working those jean shorts like she knew how to, but then tossed me a glance over her shoulder, "Baby you know me. I see a cheek, I pinch." And then once she had reached the grass, "Bring the ice when you come!"
