 
 Prologue
 
 Tailgate down I fished out the ratty old quilt and tossed it to my boy who took off in a sprint towards the field.
  "Joseph!", his mother hollered from inside the cab, "Son, don't be draggin my good picnic blanket through the dirt!"
  Two scrawny arms lifted it off the ground, barely, until he reached the grass edge. Suzanne got out and lit a cigarette as she came to the back of the truck, "Baby hand me that basket and that gallon of tea." I did so. "Thank you baby, and them solo cups too, behind the toolbox there." But as I leaned over to reach the cups I felt a pinch. "Woman!" I handed her the cups and she gave me this shit-eating grin and walked off across the parking area, working those jean shorts like she knew how to, and then tossed me a glance over her shoulder, "You know me. I see a cheek, I pinch."
