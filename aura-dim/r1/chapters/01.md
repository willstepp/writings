  Behind the abandoned strip mall where the Krogers used to be, where he liked to meet up with folks this side of town, he waited in the dark, in his pickup, alone. Sleet and rain pummeled the roof and every ten seconds the wiper blades brushed away the icy accumulation on the windshield with a steady _ca-chunk_, _ca-chunk_. This storm was something fierce. Violent gusts of wind whipped the CB antenna against his truckbed, moaning like some ghoul from a B horror movie. He was glad he was not out in this shit. Or exposed, at least. He turned the heater knob to full blast and rubbed his hands together under a vent to warm his fingers, which had gone numb in the drafty cab. The only light inside came from the gauges on the dashboard, casting a dim, green pall over his exhausted face. He fumbled in the seat for the cell phone and checked it one more time for any new messages. But nothing. Then he palmed the gun in his left jacket pocket, liking the feeling of safety it gave him, especially here, and stared absently into the alleyway, past the trees at the opposite end, behind which he knew was an unused railroad track and beyond that a trailer park where Mexicans lived. Then out of nowhere a thought crossed his delirious mind. Lou Reed was full of shit. Aint no _Waiting for the Man_. Not no more. These days you got there first, before your customer did. Scope things out, peer behind the trash bins, around the corners. Inside the fucking drainage ditch. Everywhere. That is, if you wanted to live a long life. Be paranoid. That was the rule now. Be like a fiend yourself.
  Later, just as he was about to nod off, beams from car headlights emerged from around the corner and spread up the side of the building, cutting through the downpour and across a toppled baby stroller and some crates stacked in the alleyway. He jerked upright. After a few moments he recognized the pattern of the lights to be those of that piece of shit muscle car Grady had been restoring for years. That old Dodge. He flashed his own lights twice to indicate where he was and the car stopped momentarily, then slowly continued to the corner where his pickup was parked. 
  The Dodge switched off its lights as it got close, but not before the beams flooded the cab and blinded him momentarily. He shielded both eyes with his right arm. And after his eyes readjusted to the dark he could see movement inside the car, now pulled beside him. Suddenly both doors of the Dodge swung open, then shut again, and a few moments after that the passenger door of his pickup opened and two figures slid inside, bringing with them a cold blast of wind and rain.
  "Shut the goddamn door you pokey bastard."
  Jenn was the first one inside and had inched up so close to him her knee was pressed into his own. Despite the bad weather all she wore was a pair of jean shorts over ripped, black leggings and a fake leather jacket over a neon halter top, exposing the loose paunch of her midriff. She was thin. As thin as he had ever seen her, despite the gut. Her hair was stringy and unkempt. Her fingernails bitten to the quick. Dark circles under her eyes told him she had not slept for many days. Her face and arms were pockmarked with sores and her complexion was the hue of cigarette ash. And those teeth. Jesus Christ. He remembered a time not too long ago when she had been attractive. Sexy even. Back then her hands did not tremble like they did now. Back then there was still something alive behind those glassy eyes.
  "Fuck. Off. Bitch. If youda just gone when I said to--"
  "Boy," she said, pointing a finger in his face, "You dont you talk to me like that. Grady, I swear to God!"
  "Swear what Jenn? Last I checked its a free country, by God."
  He had known Grady for years. Had worked with him at Marglen until they shut the doors two years ago. He was good people until he hooked up with Jenn and they popped out some babies. She was his downfall, the way he saw it. It was her that got him to try meth for the first time. And that was that. But they were reliable customers. And those were hard to come by these days as he was starting to learn. That fact alone was what got his ass out of bed at one this morning in this shit.
  And then, it was like Grady and Jenn both realized where they were and what they were there for and stopped bickering.
  She turned to him, a kind smile on her face, the rage gone just as fast as it had come.
  "Will baby, how you been darlin?"
  He nodded. Said nothing.
  Grady gave a small wave from the passenger seat.
  "Hey dude, thanks for meeting us out in this weather. We appreciate it greatly."
  "Damn right," she said, "And dude, what you gave us last time was straight. We was trippin balls for like seven days. No lie."
  In the silence that followed it was clear to him that despite their friendly talk, Grady and Jenn were very much afraid to be in the truck with him. Fearful, and very much so. He saw that in their sidelong looks that never lingered too long on his eyes. In the worried, clandestine glances they exchanged with each other when they thought he wasn't looking. He felt their fear and wondered where it had come from. Because, what had he done to deserve it, really? Nothing. But maybe because he was dealing for Rodriguez from Kennesaw that gave him an aura of danger he had not earned. It isolated them from him, even from Grady with whom he had once been friends. And a part of him regretted that. But he was glad at the end of the day. He wondered if they knew what he carried in his left jacket pocket. They probably did.
  Then from his other pocket he pulled out a plastic baggie in the shape of a ball and set it on the cup holder in front of them, white shards packed tightly within. For a moment they all looked at it without saying anything. Then Jenn spoke.
  "Well there it is."
  More silence. He waited. Then she spoke again.
  "Suppose we oughta be upfront and let you know this right here will be our last score. That's right. After tonight, me and Grady, we're going straight edge. No more of this poison in our bodies. God as my witness."
