  Behind an old strip mall where the Krogers used to be, where he liked to meet up with folks this side of town, he waited in the dark, in his pickup, alone. Sleet and rain pummeled the roof and every few seconds the wiper blades brushed away the accumulation on the windshield with a loud ca-chunk. This storm was something fierce. Violent gusts of wind whipped the CB antenna against the truckbed, moaning like some ghoul from a B horror movie. He was glad he was not out in this shit. Or rather, exposed to the elements. He turned the heater knob to full blast and rubbed his hands under a vent to warm his fingers. The only light in the cabin came from the gauges on the dashboard, casting a dim, green pall over his face. He fumbled in the seat next to him for his cell phone and checked it once more for any new texts. But nothing. Then he palmed the gun in his left jacket pocket, liking the feeling of safety it gave him, and stared absently into the alleyway, past the tree line at the opposite end, behind which he knew was an unused railroad track and beyond that a trailer park where the Mexicans lived. Then out of nowhere a thought crossed his mind and he had to smile, Lou Reed was full of shit, wasnt he? Aint no _Waiting for the Man_. Not no more. These days you get there first, before your customer. If you wanted to live a long life that is. Scope things out, peer behind the trash bins, around the corners. Under the fucking rocks if you had to. Be paranoid. Be like a fiend yourself.
  Later, as he was about to nod off, headlight beams emerged from around the corner and spread up the side of the building, shining through the sleet and across a toppled shopping cart and some piled crates in the alleyway. He jerked up and recognized the pattern of the headlights to be those of that piece of shit muscle car Grady drove. That Dodge. He flashed his own beams twice to indicate where he was. The car stopped when it saw his lights then slowly continued to the corner where his pickup was parked.
