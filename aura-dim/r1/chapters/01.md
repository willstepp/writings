  Behind the old strip mall where Krogers used to be, where he liked to meet up with folks this side of town, he waited in the dark, in his pickup, alone. Sleet and rain pummeled the roof and every few seconds the wiper blades brushed away the accumulation on the windshield with a loud _ca-chunk_. This storm was something fierce. Violent gusts of wind whipped his CB antenna against the truckbed, moaning like some ghoul from a B horror movie. He was glad he was not out in this shit. Or rather, exposed. He turned the heater knob to full blast and rubbed his hands under a vent to warm his fingers, which had gone numb in the drafty cabin. The only light inside came from the gauges on the dashboard, casting a dim, green pall over his tired face. He fumbled in the seat for his cell phone and checked it one more time for any new texts. But nothing. Then he palmed the gun in his left jacket pocket, liking the feeling of safety it gave him, especially on a night like this, and stared absently into the alleyway, past the tree line at the opposite end, behind which he knew was an unused railroad track and beyond that a trailer park where the Mexicans lived. Then out of nowhere a thought crossed his delirious mind. Lou Reed was full of shit, wasnt he? Aint no _Waiting for the Man_. Not no more. These days you got there first, before your customer did. Scope things out, peer behind the trash bins, around the corners. Inside the fucking drainage ditch. Everywhere. That is, if you wanted to live a long life. Be paranoid. That was the rule. Be like a fiend yourself.
  Later, just as he was about to nod off, beams from car headlights emerged from around the corner and spread up the side of the building, cutting through the downpour and across a toppled baby stroller and some crates stacked in the alleyway. He jerked upright. After a few moments he recognized the pattern of the headlights to be those of that piece of shit muscle car Grady had been restoring for years. That old Dodge. He flashed his own beams twice to indicate where he was and the car stopped momentarily, then slowly continued to the corner where his pickup was parked. 
  The Dodge switched off its lights as it got close, but not before the beams had flooded the pickup cabin and blinded him momentarily. He shielded both his eyes with his arm. And after his eyes readjusted to the dark he could see movement inside the car, now pulled into the space beside him. Suddenly both doors of the Dodge swung open, then shut again, and a few moments later the passenger door of his pickup opened and two figures slid inside, bringing with them an icy blast of wind and rain.
  "Shut the goddamn door you pokey bastard!"
  Jenn was the first inside and had inched up so close to him her knee was pressed into his own. Despite the bad weather all she had on was a pair of jean shorts over ripped, black leggings and a fake leather jacket over a neon halter top, exposing the loose paunch of her midriff. She was thin. As thin as he had ever seen her, despite the gut. Her hair was stringy and unkempt. Her fingernails were bitten to the quick. Dark circles under her eyes told him she had not slept for many days. Her face and arms were pockmarked with sores and her complexion was the hue of cigarette ash. And those teeth. Jesus Christ. He remembered a time not very long ago when Jenn had been attractive. Sexy even. Back then her hands did not tremble like they did now. Back then there was still something alive behind her hardened eyes.
  "Fuck you, Jenn."
  "Boy you dont you talk to me like that! Grady, I swear to God, one of these days."
  "One of these days what? Last I checked, its a free country, by God."
  He had known Grady for years. Worked with him at Marglen until they shut the doors. He was good people until got hooked up with Jenn and they popped out some babies. She was his downfall. At least it seemed that way to him. It was her that got him to try meth for the first time. And that, as they say, was that. But they were reliable customers. And those were hard to come by. He was starting to learn. That fact alone was what got his ass out of bed at one this morning in the storm.
  Then, it was like Grady and Jenn both realized where they were and what they were there for, and stopped bickering.
  Jenn turned to him, smiling.
  "Will, baby, how you been darlin?"
  He nodded, but said nothing.
  Grady gave a small wave.
  "Hey man, thanks for meeting us out in this shit. We appreciate it. You know we do."
  "Damn straight," Jenn agreed, "and dude, what you gave us last time was the bomb. We was trippin balls for like seven days, I swear to God!"
  In the silence that followed it became clear to him that despite the friendly greetings, they were very much afraid to be in the truck with him. Fearful, and very much so. He saw that in their eyes that would not look at him directly. In the worried glances they exchanged with each other under the radar. He felt their fear of him and wondered where it came from. Because, what had he done to deserve it really? Nothing. But maybe because he was dealing for Rodriguez from Kennesaw that gave him some kind of dangerous aura he had not earned. And it isolated them from him. Even with Grady with whom he had once been friends. But he was glad for the fear at the end of the day. It protected him from erratic behavior. He wondered if they knew about the gun he carried in his jacket pocket. They probably did. That was okay too.
