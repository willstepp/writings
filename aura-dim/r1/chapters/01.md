  Behind the abandoned strip mall where the Krogers used to be, where he liked to meet up with folks this side of town, he waited in the dark, in his pickup, alone. A freezing rain battered the rooftop and intermittently the wipers brushed away icy accumulation from the windshield with a rhythmic _ca-chunk_, _ca-chunk_. Rogue gusts of wind whipped his CB antenna against the truckbed, moaning like some ghoul out of a B horror movie. He turned the heater knob to full blast and articulated his fingers under a vent to warm them after they went numb inside the drafty cabin. The only light was emitted from the dashboard gauges and cast a dim, green pall over his tired face. He fumbled in the seat next to him for the cell phone and checked it one more time for any new messages. Nothing. Then he palmed the gun in his left jacket pocket, liking the feeling of safety it gave him and then stared absently into the alley, past the line of trees at the end, behind which he knew was an unused railroad track and beyond that a trailer park where Mexicans families lived. Then out of nowhere a thought crossed his unfocused mind. Lou Reed was full of shit. There werent no _Waiting for the Man_. Not no more. These days you had to get there first, before the customer. Scope things out, check around the corners, peer behind the trash cans, crawl inside the fucking drainage ditches if you had to. Look everywhere for signs of danger. That is, if you expected to live a long and fruitful life. Be paranoid. That was the rule. Be like a fiend yourself.
  Fifteen minutes later, just as he was about to nod off, beams from a car's headlights emerged from around the bend and spread up the side of the long brick building, cutting through the downpour and across a toppled baby stroller and some busted palettes in the alley. He jerked upright but after a few moments recognized the pattern of the lights to be those of that piece of shit muscle car Grady owned. That old Dodge. He flashed his beams twice to indicate where he was and the car braked momentarily then slowly continued to the corner where his pickup was parked.
  The Dodge switched off its headlights when it got close but not before light flooded his cabin and momentarily blinded him. He shielded both eyes with his right arm then after his eyes readjusted to the dark he saw movement inside the car, now parked beside him. Suddenly the doors of the Dodge flung open, two figures emerged and a few moments after that the passenger door of his pickup opened and the two figures slid inside, bringing with them a cold blast of wind and wet.
  Jenn was the first inside and scooted so close to him her knee pressed into his own. Despite the bad weather all she wore was a pair of jean shorts over ripped, black leggings and a fake leather jacket over a neon halter top, exposing the loose paunch of her midriff. She was thin. As thin as he had ever seen her, despite the paunch. Her hair was stringy and unkempt, tied in a loose and now soaking bun. Her pink fingernails were bitten to the quick. Dark circles under her eyes told him she had not slept for many days. Her face and arms were pockmarked with sores and her skin was the attractive hue of cigarette ash. And those teeth. Jesus Christ. He remembered a time not too long ago when she had been a head-turner. Sexy as hell. Back then her hands didn't tremble at rest like they did now. Back then there was still something alive behind those joyless, dark eyes.
  "Shut the goddamn door you pokey bastard," she said, her voice like gravel, a smokers voice, barely anything feminine left.
  Grady slammed the door and ran both hands through his wet hair. His whole body shivered and he bellowed.
  "Goddamn its colder than a sonofabitchin witches titty out there tonight!"
  He had known Grady for years, had worked with him at Marglen until they shut the doors two years ago. He was good people until he hooked up with her. She was his downfall the way it seemed to him. It was Jenn that got him to try meth for the first time. And that was all she wrote, as they say. But they were reliable customers. And those were hard to come by these days. That fact alone was what had got his ass out of bed at one am, in this weather, to make a sale.
  She twisted on the bench seat in his direction, beaming at him as if she were the host of an infomercial.
  "Will baby, how you been darlin?"
  He nodded. Said nothing.
  Grady gave a small wave from the passenger seat.
  "Hey dude, thanks for meeting us last minute in this shit. We appreciate it greatly."
  "Damn hero is what you are," she said, "And dude, let me just say, what you gave us before Christmas was straight. We was trippin balls for like seven days no lie."
  In the quiet that followed it was clear that despite their friendly demeanor, both of them were uneasy to be in the truck with. Fearful, and very much so. He saw that in their eyes that never lingered for too long on his own. In the worried, clandestine glances they exchanged with each other when they thought he wasn't looking. He wondered where it had come from. Because what had he done to deserve it really? Nothing he could think of. But maybe because he was now dealing for Rodriguez in Kennesaw, that gave him an aura of danger he had not earned. It isolated them from him in a way that was nearly physical, even from Grady with whom he had once been friends. And a part of him regretted that sad as it is to say. But he was glad too because it protected him from any erratic behavior on their part. He wondered if they knew what he carried in his left jacket pocket. They probably did.
  He pulled out a plastic baggie in the shape of a ball and set it on the dash in front of them, the white shards packed tightly within, and for a moment they all looked at it without saying anything at all. Jenn spoke first.
  "Well there it is."
  Yet more silence. Then she spoke again.
  "But here's the thing. We thought we oughta let you know this will be our last score. That's right. Me and Grady are goin straight edge. For good this time. No more of this poison in our bodies. We agreed as a couple."
  "Three hundred."
