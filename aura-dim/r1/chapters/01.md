  Behind the old strip mall where Krogers used to be, where he liked to meet up with folks this side of town, he waited in the dark, in his pickup, alone. Sleet and rain pummeled the roof and every few seconds the wiper blades brushed away the accumulation on the windshield with a loud _ca-chunk_. This storm was something fierce. Violent gusts of wind whipped his CB antenna against the truckbed, moaning like some ghoul from a B horror movie. He was glad he was not out in this shit. Or rather, exposed. He turned the heater knob to full blast and rubbed his hands under a vent to warm his fingers, which had gone numb in the drafty cabin. The only light inside came from the gauges on the dashboard, casting a dim, green pall over his tired face. He fumbled in the seat for his cell phone and checked it one more time for any new texts. But nothing. Then he palmed the gun in his left jacket pocket, liking the feeling of safety it gave him, especially on a night like this, and stared absently into the alleyway, past the tree line at the opposite end, behind which he knew was an unused railroad track and beyond that a trailer park where the Mexicans lived. Then out of nowhere a thought crossed his delirious mind. Lou Reed was full of shit, wasnt he? Aint no _Waiting for the Man_. Not no more there aint. These days you got there first, before the customer did. Scope things out, peer behind the trash bins, around the corners. Inside the fucking drainage ditch. Everywhere. That is, if you wanted to live a long, happy life. Be paranoid. That was the rule. Be like a fiend yourself.
  Later, just as he was about to nod off, beams from car headlights emerged from around the corner and spread up the side of the building, cutting through the freezing rain and across a toppled baby stroller and some crates piled in the alleyway. He jerked upright. After a few moments he recognized the pattern of the headlights to be those of that piece of shit muscle car Grady was restoring. That old Dodge. He flashed his own beams twice to indicate where he was and the car stopped momentarily, then slowly continued to the corner where his pickup was parked.
