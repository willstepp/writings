  Behind the abandoned strip mall where the Krogers used to be, where he liked to meet up with folks this side of town, he waited in the dark, in his pickup, alone. Sleet and rain pummeled the roof and intermittently the wiper blades brushed away the icy accumulation on the windshield with a steady _ca-chunk_, _ca-chunk_. This storm was something fierce. Violent gusts of wind whipped the CB antenna against his truckbed, moaning like some ghoul from a B horror movie. He turned the heater knob to full blast and rubbed his hands together under a vent to warm his fingers, which had gone numb in the drafty cab. The only light inside came from the gauges on the dashboard, casting a dim, green pall over his tired face. He fumbled in the seat for the cell phone and checked it one more time for any new messages. But nothing. Then he palmed the gun in his left jacket pocket, liking the feeling of safety it gave him, especially here, and stared absently into the alleyway, past the trees at the opposite end, behind which he knew was an unused railroad track and beyond that a trailer park where Mexicans lived. Then out of nowhere a thought crossed his somewhat delirious mind. Lou Reed had been full of shit when he sang that song, because there aint no _Waiting for the Man_. Not no more. These days you got there first, before your customer. Scope things out, peer behind the trash bins, around the corners. Inside the fucking drainage ditch. Everywhere. That is, if you wanted to live a long and fruitful life. Be paranoid. That was the rule. Be like a fiend yourself.
  Later, just as he was about to nod off, beams from car headlights emerged from around the corner and spread up the side of the building, cutting through the downpour and across a toppled baby stroller and some crates stacked in the alleyway. He jerked upright. After a few moments he recognized the pattern of the lights to be those of that piece of shit muscle car Grady had been restoring for years. That old Dodge. He flashed his own lights twice to indicate where he was and the car stopped momentarily, then slowly continued to the corner where his pickup was parked. 
  The Dodge switched off its lights as it got close, but not before the beams flooded the cab and blinded him momentarily. He shielded both eyes with his right arm. And after his eyes readjusted to the dark he could see movement inside the car, now pulled beside him. Suddenly both doors of the Dodge swung open, then shut again, and a few moments after that the passenger door of his pickup opened and two figures slid inside, bringing with them a cold blast of wind and rain.
  Jenn was the first one inside and had scooted up so close to him her knee pressed into his own. He inched away. Despite the bad weather all she had on was a pair of jean shorts over ripped, black leggings and a fake leather jacket over a neon halter top, exposing the loose paunch of her midriff. She was thin. As thin as he had ever seen her, despite the paunch. Her hair was stringy and unkempt, tied in a bun. Her fingernails bitten to the quick. Dark circles under her eyes told him she had not slept for many days. Her face and arms were pockmarked with sores and her skin was the hue of cigarette ash. And those teeth. Jesus Christ. He remembered a time not too long ago when she had been good looking. Sexy even. Back then her hands didn't tremble like they did now. Back then there was still something alive behind her joyless eyes.
  "Shut the goddamn door you pokey bastard," she said, her voice deep and gravelly, a smokers voice, barely anything feminine about it.
  Grady slammed the door hard and ran both hands through his wet hair. His whole body shivered.
  "Goddamn its colder than a witches titty out there!"
  He had known Grady for years. Had worked with him at Marglen until they shut the doors two years ago. He was good people until he hooked up with Jenn and they popped out a kid. She was his downfall the way he saw it. It was her that got him to try meth for the first time. And that was that, as they say. But they were reliable customers to him. And as he was starting to learn, those were hard to come by in these lean times. That fact alone was what had got his ass out of bed at one am in this weather.
  She twisted on the bench seat, beaming at him, as if she were about to sell him something.
  "Will baby, how you been darlin?"
  He nodded, but said nothing.
  Grady gave a small wave from the passenger seat.
  "Hey dude, thanks for meeting us last minute in this shit. We appreciate it greatly."
  "Damn hero is what you are," she said, "And dude, let me say, what you gave us before Christmastime was the bomb. We was trippin balls for like seven days. No lie."
  In the silence that followed it was clear that despite their friendly demeanor, both of them were uneasy. Fearful even, and very much so. He saw that in their eyes that never lingered for too long on his own. In the worried, clandestine glances they exchanged with each other when they thought he wasn't looking. He wondered where that had come from. Because what had he done to deserve it, really? Nothing he could think of. But maybe because he was dealing for Rodriguez from Kennesaw that gave him an aura of danger he had not earned. It isolated them from him in a way that was almost physical, even from Grady with whom he had once been friends. And a part of him regretted that, sad as it is to say. But he was glad too, because it protected him from any erratic behavior on their part. He wondered if they knew what he carried in his left jacket pocket. They probably did.
  He pulled out a plastic baggie in the shape of a ball and set it on the dash in front of them, the white shards packed tightly within, and for a moment they all looked at it without saying anything at all. Then Jenn spoke.
  "Well there it is."
  Yet more silence. He waited. Then she spoke again.
  "But here's the thing, suppose we oughta be upfront and let you know this will be our last score. That's right. After tonight, me and Grady are goin straight edge. Forever. No more of this poison in our bodies. God as my witness."
  "Three hundred."
