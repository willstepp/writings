Tall Grass, Pickles, Kite, Woods, Fried Strawberry Pies

  He flipped down the rear gate of the truck and dug out the blanket and handed it to his boy Joseph, who immediately ran off towards the field, dragging it through the red dirt of the parking area. Suzanne lifted the picnic basket with one hand and cupped her other hand to her mouth and shouted to their son.
  "Joseph Michael, get my blanket off the ground before I drag your ass through it!"
  The boy awkwardly lifted the blanket over his head and kept walking until he reached the tall grass. His wife grabbed the gallon of sweet tea and red plastic cups and headed toward the field.
  "Will, honey, grab the bag of ice when you come."
  "Okay, let me get this kite put together and I'll be over."
  "Don't forget the ice."
  It was a cheap kite they had picked up at the dollar store on the way over here. He opened the bag and attempted to put it together first without the instructions but he couldn't figure out which pole went into which hole and got mad and finally followed the instructions and it was okay. The kite was a rainbow colored butterfly. 
  He wound the string around his hand and held the kite at his side so the wind wouldn't catch it and headed off to where his wife and boy had set the picnic, right in the middle of the field. It took him a few minutes to walk out there and Joseph saw him and ran up and asked to look at the kite.
  "Hold up a minute, let me show you how to do it first. They's a skill to flying a kite. If you don't hold it right its liable to carry you plum over the mountain."
  Joseph grew wide eyed. Then his dad grinned and Joseph laughed. Suzanne was pulling things from the picnic basket, arranging them on the blanket.
  "Did you bring the ice?"
  He shook his head.
  "Shit no."
  "I reminded you to bring it."
  "I heard what you said."
  "Then why didn't you remember to bring the ice, grandpa?"
  "Get off my back, grandma."
  He returned with the ice and saw Joseph playing in the tall green grass. The field was usually mown by April but the county had let it slip this year. The grass went up to his knees. Whenever the wind blew it made gentle waves along the tops. Joseph crawled through the grass like a dog. He popped up every now and then, panting with his tongue hung out. He barked when he saw his father and held up both hands as if he were begging.
  "Hey doggy, you ready to fly this kite or what?"
  The dog boy nodded and jumped to his feet. He ran over and they took the kite out to a little bald spot near the blanket.
He showed Joseph how to measure the direction of the wind by wetting his thumb and holding it up.
  "Now, when you know the direction the wind is blowing, you want to turn your back to the wind and hold the kite up so the wind is blowing into it. Does that make sense?"
  The boy nodded.
  He lifted the kite and the wind filled the sails and ruffled the edges. Joseph jumped behind his father, his eyes wide.
  "Look how the kite catches the wind. That's what you want to see. From here, you make sure to hold onto the spool, like this."
  He grasped the plastic handle of the spool and unwound five loops and let them hang in his other hand.
  "You want just enough line loose so that the kite has enough slack to get into the air and stay there by itself, but not any more than that. Not yet."
  With this he heaved the kite into the wind and it caught the updraft and flew backwards with some force. He let out the slack loops and held the spool with both hands. The line went tight. The kite bobbed against the blue sky, the wind strong. He figured it was a bit too strong for the boy to hold it by himself. But he called him over and let him hold the spool handle with his father.
  "This is incredible!"
  "I know. What do you say we let it get even higher?"
  "Yeah!"
  He showed him how to unwind the spool one loop at a time, safely. The boy studied intently. They unspooled about ten winds and looked at the kite. It was higher now, smaller against the sky. The force of the wind tugged on the spool. He made sure the line wouldn't dig into the boy's hand.
  "It's almost in outer space!"
  "Almost."
  They flew the kite for several minutes. He showed him how to wind the line back onto the spool in case the wind grew slack. The kite dove a couple times and he showed him how to pull back and wind the spool to keep the line taut. In working the kite they had wandered from the picnic site and soon they heard the mother shouting.
  "Boys, time to eat some lunch!"
  Joseph looked disappointed but his father assured him they could fly more once they had eaten. They pulled in the kite and wound the spool around it. He collapsed the wings and folded it under his arm and they returned to the blanket.
