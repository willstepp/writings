TRINIDAD: A VOYAGE
by Daniel Stepp

















DOCKSIDE








October 23
The young man wore a black skull-cap pulled over his ears and a long-sleeve thermal underneath his work shirt. The night air was cold and clear and his breath came out like smoke as he walked through the high, unkempt grass, a garbage bag slung over each shoulder. It was quiet here except for the insects. This far from the main dock area it was just swamp and bugs and darkness. Yesterday the mate had even seen a cottonmouth slither from the river onto the bank, and though he wore his steel-toes, the young man put that out of his mind as he struck out across the yard. Each footstep he took through the grass was cautious and light, as he also knew there was plenty of muck out here to sink his boots into. He learned that the hard way two weeks ago, the night the boat arrived in Cameron, after a rough trip from Fourchon, side seas all the way.
The dock he now approached resembled most Louisiana docks post 9/11, with a high chain-link fence and plenty of lights. Next to the entrance sat an aluminum guard shack where an old coonass, who took his job a little too seriously, signed people in and out. Along the western wall of the dock were the trailers where oil company dispatchers and dock workers were housed. On any given night you could smell burning charcoal from the grills, hamburgers and hot dogs during the week, steaks on Sunday. Along the eastern wall was an enormous warehouse where the forklifts and other heavy machinery was kept and maintained. At the rear was the parking lot, next to the dirt road, where a sign read Park At Your Own Risk. The dock was active twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week, servicing all kinds of vessels, from rusty old work boats like the young man came from to the most technologically advanced seismic vessels in the Gulf. This night was no different.
He tossed the bags over a small iron gate and climbed over himself, one leg at a time, into the main area. He was now in the light – an amber glow which emanated from the fluorescent lamps running the length of the dock. Forklift drivers passed in front of him as he made his way to the garbage bin. He passed a large red crane with tank treads. It growled and creaked as cargo boxes were lifted from the dock to the vessel and from the vessel to the dock. As he went by he couldn’t help but notice one worker on the deck of a beat-to-hell utility boat. In one hand he held a cell phone, and with the other hand he caught each joint of drill pipe the crane lowered to him, setting it down in the right place, and unhooking the shackle with just one hand. Down on the other end of the dock, well past the dumpsters, he saw two welders at work on the hull of a three-hundred and twenty foot survey vessel. One man was lowered on a harness, suspended halfway down the bow, doing the actual work, and all the other man had to do was stand up top and watch until the welder needed to piss or take a break.
At last he reached the dumpster and a dog and some raccoons scurried out of sight. Their eyes glowered at him underneath the scattered debris. One at a time, and with a tremendous effort, he shot-putted the two bags into the bin. The first one went in fine, but the second one not quite. It snagged on a metal lip and a day’s worth of garbage spilled out all over the ground.
“Fucking hell.”
It took a few minutes to gather all the stray pieces of trash the wind had caught. Finished, the young man wiped both hands on his jeans and spit on the ground in defiance as he turned to make his way back to the boat. 
Just then in the shadows behind the bin a voice whispered to him.
He looked in the direction of the whisper and saw an indistinct shape waving him over. He hesitated. Again the whisper came but he could not make out what was being said. He did not move. At last the shape saw that he hesitated and took one step into the light. Again she motioned for him to come with her. The young man noticed her eyes were tired, impatient. She was not American. With some caution he followed her behind the dumpster where no one else could see them.
“Just so you know,” he began, “I don’t have no money. Them dock workers might have some.”
The girl did not respond. Once completely out of the light, she turned to him and pulled a small scrap of paper from her purse. She showed him the back of it. Scrawled in pencil were the words,
Etawah River Dock 2 Slip 5
She pointed at the words on the paper, then at the boat down on the other end of the dock, where he had walked from. “Will,” she said, “is that your boat?”
“What?” he asked.
“Is that your boat?”
“Yeah,” the young man answered, “How you know my name?”
She pointed at the name embroidered on his work shirt. He nodded.
“Yes, that’s my boat. Did you watch me walk over here? I need to get back.”
“You the captain?” she asked, not listening to a word he said.
“Just a hand.”
“Oh.”
“If you need something,” Will began, “you should go talk to the office, over there in that building, at the top of the steps. That’s where they are.”
He gestured to a large wooden building sat next to the trailers. This was not what she wanted to hear. She became nervous and shook her head no. Will could not place her accent. She was young, maybe early twenties, and average-looking, short but shapely. It was obvious she had not bathed or changed clothes in many days. There was a momentary silence as each sized up the other.
“They tell me you are going to Trinidad.”
Will observed her with a curious expression. The Etowah was in fact meant to depart for Trinidad the day after tomorrow, whenever the captain returned. The boat had been in Cameron for fifteen days, having some major hull damage repaired, and because of the downtime involved she lost her contract job with Ensco and picked up a spot job, delivering one piece of drilling equipment to Port Lisas.
“Who told you that?” 
She would not say. 
“Look,” she said at last, “I need a ride down there. You think you can help me out?”
Will looked at her, then said, “We’re not that kind of boat. You need a passenger boat or a plane.”
She shook her head no.
“But we’re not that kind of boat,” he repeated, “The Etowah is a supply boat. We work for the oil companies. It’d be against the law for us to give you a ride. You’re gonna have to find another way.”
Her eyes dropped. She pulled another small piece of paper from her purse and showed it to Will. It was actually an old Polaroid. On the photo was a small girl in pigtails. She sat in the lap of an older gentleman who playfully rested his head on her shoulder, both of them grinning like mules at the camera. They sat on a bench next to what looked like some brightly-colored tourist attraction. A signed overhead spelled out Trinidad in cartoon letters. The photo was quite worn.
She pointed out the sign in the photo. Will leaned in to have a closer look.
“Yeah, I see it,” he observed, “and that must be you and your daddy there on the bench.”
“Yes.”
“Look,” he began, “I understand your situation. I ain’t heartless. Don’t get me wrong. But the Coast Guard would have our ass if they found out we were giving rides to folks. We might go to jail over something like that. I’m just a hand on there. I couldn’t help you out if I wanted to. There’s bound to be all kinds of paperwork involved. It just ain’t gonna happen.”
It occurred to him as he spoke that likely this girl had come to the US illegally in the first place, otherwise why try to catch a ride back to your home country like this? Likely, he thought, she had hooked up with some asshole captain over there who promised her a good life in the States, screwed her brains out on the ride over, only to ditch her when they got here. That sort of thing happened all the time, or at least he heard it did. Out here you hear a lot of stories, but you never know for sure what to believe.
Will continued, “I need to get back to my watch now. I do understand where you’re coming from. But you got to understand where I’m coming from.”
He did not look at her once as he spoke these words. She was silent. Over and over she turned the photograph in her hands. Then from her purse she pulled out a wad of money. Before Will could react she grabbed his left arm and stuffed a bunch of old bills into his hand. He counted it, about a hundred bucks – a little less than half his day rate.
“I can’t help you.”
#
The Etowah River was a sixteen-hundred ton supply vessel, according to the brittle, sun-dried certifications on display in the wheelhouse, built in 1973 out of Morgan City, Louisiana. Its dimensions were one-hundred and ninety feet long by fifty feet wide. A hundred feet of that length was open deck space, used for various purposes but mostly to carry drilling supplies and machinery to and from oil rigs in the Gulf of Mexico. The Etowah was in very good condition for a boat as old as it was, one of the better boats in the fleet. The company which now owned the Etowah had purchased it cheaply after it collided with another work boat on a foggy night in 1987 and sank to the bottom of Bayou LaFourche. Many hands would not work on the Etowah for this reason, as a cook and engineer had drowned in the collision. The boat was then known as the Freedom II. Floating around the company were photographs of the boat being hauled out of the muddy water by crane, a gaping hole carved into its side.
Tonight the vessel sat dockside, motionless and silent. Against its barnacled hull the river water lapped gently. Ripples in the stream reflected lights from the docks across the channel. Everyone on board was now asleep except for Will and the oiler. But that only meant three others. At the moment the oiler was down in the engine room performing a last-minute oil change on the two generators before the trip out. From below the main deck came the occasional clang and thud of his labor.
As he approached the boat, Will saw that once again he had forgotten to turn on the flood lights at sundown, so the hundred foot span of deck space aft of the cabin was mostly dark. Back there a large shadow loomed in the center of the deck, the piece of equipment the Etowah was to deliver.
The gangway rose up and down like a seesaw as Will crossed from the dock to the boat. He walked straight to the galley door before remembering to wash off his muddy boots with the garden hose. After they were clean he removed them and placed them just inside the galley door, taking care it did not slam as it closed. Then, in his socks, he crept up the outside stairs to the wheelhouse deck, entering the cabin by the side door, again very carefully and without a sound.
Just then a crew boat passed nearby on its way out the channel, the high-pitched engine disrupting the near complete silence. A few seconds later its wake reached the Etowah. The boat rocked gently up and down. The mooring lines were pulled taut then relaxed again with the sway.
Minutes later Will appeared at the galley door, back on the main deck level, and peered out the plexiglass towards the direction of the passing crew boat. He came outside and paused momentarily beside the hose rack. He seemed distracted. The sight of the gangway, pushed crooked from the crew boat’s wake, brought him out of his contemplation. He straightened it with little effort and then tightened the line that held it to the gate shackle. Then Will walked the circumference of the main deck, making sure the mooring lines were secure. As the boat drifted forward again he took slack out of the stern line. Next he closed the engine room hatch on the port stack and dogged it down. Finally he came around again to the gate. Will cupped his hands around his mouth and gave a low whistle. Soon the girl appeared out of the grass. He took her by the hand and helped her across the gangway onto the boat.
It was nine past eleven now. The hands on the Etowah worked alternating twelve-hour watches, each man acting as relief for the other. Will worked the noon to midnight watch and the other hand worked the midnight to noon. Will knew the other deck hand would be awake soon as his watch began at midnight. So there was not much time to do what he had decided to do.
At the moment he was not much concerned with the oiler – he would never come out of the engine room in the middle of an oil change, made too much of a mess. It did concern him that the mate or engineer might be in the galley for a late-night snack. For this reason he walked well ahead of the girl and made her stand in the dark underneath the stairs while he surveyed the galley to make sure it was clear. Once satisfied no one else was around, Will took her by the hand forcefully and stepped into the galley first and walked her straight to his room down the hall.
Fortunately his room was removed from the main galley area, a fact which led him to choose that room as his own in the first place. It was about the only place on the boat you could have any real privacy. The only other room down this hallway was a small head, and it sat between the galley and his room, so there was that extra buffer. One negative about his room was that it sat just above the bow thruster and behind the anchor chain locker. These facts had caused him quite a few sleepless nights, he would admit.
They reached his state room with no trouble and Will showed her inside. His room had three bunks total. There were bunk-beds on the left and a single bed on the right. Will always slept on the top bunk and the bottom bunk was in such a location that unless you walked all the way into the room and turned to the left, you could not see what was in it. Clothes were strewn on the floor and piled up on the empty bunk. Will shut the door behind them and quickly tossed his clothes into an empty cardboard box which served as the laundry basket.
“Put your things in the locker here,” he gestured to the wooden lockers next to the bunk. She did as he said. He then pointed out the bottom bunk.
“You will stay here always. Do you understand? If you need anything I can get it for you.”
“Fine,” she nodded.
She set her purse down on the bunk and surveyed the room, wrinkling her nose.
“What do I smell in here? It smells really bad on this boat.”
“You get used to it after awhile,” Will replied.
He then improvised a plan to prevent anyone from walking into his room unannounced. It was rare for anyone to come in anyway, but as a precaution he reasoned it would be better to keep the door locked at all times. Normally the crew left their doors unlocked for safety reasons. It would be suspicious now if anyone tried to open the door when he was not inside, but he thought he could play that off easily enough. He showed her how to lock the door and explained that he would keep it locked whenever he was on watch. She would therefore be responsible for unlocking it when he returned, so she needed to pay close attention. Will rapped a unique pattern on the locker and told her that would be their secret knock. If the knock at the door was not the secret knock, you do not open it. No one ever saw Will go into and out of his room, so he reasoned this could be managed with little suspicion. When he finished, he observed her expression to make sure she really understood. He asked her to repeat what he said and with a little resentment she repeated it all without error. This satisfied him.
By then it was eleven thirty. The other hand would definitely be awake by now. Will needed to make it up to the wheelhouse before the other hand since he was supposed to be on radio watch. He gestured once more to the bunk and without hesitation she began to undress in front of him, jeans first. She pulled them down around her hips, exposing a pair of orange gym shorts underneath. When she knelt to pull the jeans over her ankles he couldn’t help but notice her breasts moving freely under her blouse. He stopped her, unsure whether she just didn’t care or that maybe she thought he was ordering her to undress.
“What are you doing?” he said, “You don’t have to take off your clothes.”
She startled at his outburst and froze in place.
“I’m sorry,” she said, “I don’t want to sleep in my jeans tonight. Do you think I should leave them on?”
“No,” Will replied, confused. He hadn’t meant to frighten her, “I mean, do whatever makes you feel comfortable.”
“Thank you,” she answered, then continued to undress as before, only down to her shorts and a t-shirt. She set her clothes on the locker next to the bunk.
Once again Will reminded her she needed to listen for the secret knock. She nodded politely and climbed into the bottom bunk, pulling the old blanket over her. He stood there a moment, in thought, and then walked out of the room. Outside, he turned the knob to make sure it was locked and continued upstairs to the wheelhouse.

“Mr. Will, Mr. Will,” The other hand said as lumbered up the steps to the wheelhouse, coffee mug in hand, stepping lightly so as not to wake the other crew, “Good morning to you sir.”
“Morning, Nathan.”
Will’s feet were propped on the rear console. He casually flipped through the pages of an old Maxim magazine, and gave a slight nod to Nathan. In the background the radios blared intermittently. The windows which lined the wheelhouse glistened with beads on condensation. Outside, insects hovered around the flood lights Will had since turned on. Nathan walked to the helm, set down his mug, and tied an old bandana around his short, salt-and-pepper afro.
“Mr. Will,” Nathan said, “I got a quick question for you.”
“What’s that?”
“Well, I was just in the galley and I noticed something peculiar.”
“What’s that?”
“Well,” Nathan said, a bit hesitant, “it ain’t that important, but did you happen to finish off my Golden Grahams?”
Will did not answer, nor even look in Nathan’s direction. He just flipped through the magazine as Nathan watched. Finally Will shrugged his shoulders.
“Those aren’t your Golden Grahams,” he replied, “They’re the boats.”
Nathan looked hard at Will. He took a sip of coffee, as if he needed time to respond.
“Okay,” he restarted, “Did you finish off the rest of the boat’s Golden Grahams?”
“Yep.”
“Well look, I ain’t mad about it, but I put Golden Grahams on the list ever week specific, so I’d like if I could have me a bowl now and then, if that’s not too much to ask.”
“If you aren’t mad,” Will replied, “then why mention it?”
Nathan’s eyes grew wide.
“What you say?”
“I said, if you aren’t mad, then why mention it at all? There’s more important things in life than Golden Grahams for Christ’s sake.”
“Okay,” Nathan admitted, “I am mad about it.”
“Okay then, that’s all you had to say. I’ll try to leave you some Golden Grahams from now on.”
“Okay then.”
Nathan walked over and sat next to Will. Neither spoke, but ever so often Nathan glared at Will from the corner of his eye. This went on for minutes, the glaring, and from time to time sips from his coffee mug. The silence in the room was unbearable, but pretty soon Will grinned. He tried without success to suppress it. They both laughed.
“So what did I miss?” Nathan asked. He leaned back in the chair and propped his feet on the console, mimicking Will.
“Nothing really,” Will said. He set down the magazine, “Jesse had me down there with him all day, doing maintenance work for the trip. Feel like a damn grease monkey.”
“It’s good for you. Put hair on your chest. Me, I can’t wait to get my oiler ticket. I’m tired of chipping and painting all the time. That’s for young men like you.”
“You can have it. Martinez is down there, changing the oil on the generators,” Will added, “Oh, I took off the trash a little while ago.”
“Okay,” Nathan said, pleased, “Good man. Thank you. Looking out for me, huh?”
“Yeah.”
The radios became noisier and noisier, so Nathan got up and turned them down a notch.
“Radios!” Nathan shouted, with an exaggerated redneck drawl, “I hate radios. Radios all the time!”
“Okay, Captain Frank,” Will laughed, “I hate cars. I love trains!”
They both laughed.
“I don’t know why you laughing so much,” Nathan said, “You his pet. Did he get back yet?”
Will shook his head, “He called Drew and said he’d be here sometime in the morning. Has to come from Mississippi.”
“Yeah.”
They both sat there, saying nothing.
“They we’ll be underway, out of the country.”
“Yep.”
“You know,” Nathan said, “I’m surprised Renee let the crew stay on. They was supposed to get an alternate crew.”
“I guess they decided it would be best to have a crew familiar with the Etowah making the trip.”
“I guess,” Nathan said, then he laughed, “I figured Renee would probably send me off to five different boats in one day, like what happened last year. That was a mess, boy. Let me tell you what.”
“I remember that.”
“Renee calls me up, so Nathan look here, we need you over there on the York River, can you make it to Intercoastal City by seven in the morning? Okay Renee, I’ll be there. Click. So I go to the York, ain’t had no sleep yet keep in mind. I get over there, relieve the hand. The mate says get some rest, so I lay down. Not five minutes later the sideband goes off. Renee again. Change of plan, Nathan. Need you in Fourchon tomorrow morning at five, got to catch a crew boat out to the James River. Hand on there got sick. Okay Renee, I’ll be there. Click. I’ll be doggone if I ain’t gonna get some some rest first. You know what I’m saying?”
“I hear you,” Will said, “Then you had to go the Elkhorn, right?”
“Well I got me some shut eye that night. Fourchon ain’t but a four hour drive from Intercoastal, so I got there in plenty of time. Guess what happened then?”
“The hand wasn’t sick.”
“Renee calls just before the crew boat’s leaving. Nathan, sorry buddy, that hand don’t need to come off no more, just come on back here to Houma, behind the office, you can stay on the Elkhorn until we got someplace you can go. Okay Renee, I’ll be there. Click. Man, let me tell you. I drove to Houma, took my sweet time with it though. Stopped at the Wal-Mart along the way, picked up some videos. Get to Houma. Captain on the Elkhorn says, are you Nathan? Yes, sir. Let me guess, they need me back on the Etowah. How did you know?”
Nathan laughed and laughed. Will smiled.
“So after all that you ended up back on the Etowah.”
“Right back where I started from,” Nathan sighed, “Man, what a mess. I told Renee about it later too. We laughed about it. Man, oh man. This old black man gonna stay put from now on Renee, I told him. I’m too old for this stuff.”
“But you aren’t too old for Trinidad?”
Nathan smiled, “You got me there. Yeah, you got me on that one. Trust me, if it was up to my wife my butt would be at the house.”
The last words he spoke hung in the air. Neither said much after that, but the silence was not uncomfortable. They both stared out at the river, the water going by, the bugs outside. At last Will rose from his chair.
Nathan asked, “Want me to knock on your door at the usual time, make sure you up?”
“No,” Will said, “Gonna start using that old alarm clock Drew gave me.”
“Sounds like a plan.”
Will descended the stairs.
“See you on the flip side, Nathan.”
“Lord willin’ and the crick don’t rise.”
#
Will pressed his ear against the door to his room. He carried a rolled-up bag of Doritos and a can of Coke. He listened for a few moments for any sounds coming from within, but heard nothing. Then he knocked the secret knock, ever so lightly. There was no movement on the other side of the door. He paused, then knocked a bit louder, glancing down the hallway in the direction of the galley. Nothing. A look of concern fell over his face. In the haste he had not considered how much this situation depended upon her cooperation. At last the doorknob turned and the door opened just a sliver, her eye on him. He entered the room, locking the door behind them both, and handed her the snacks. She took it back to her bunk and began to shovel chips into her mouth by the handful. Will watched her.
“When was the last time you ate something?” he asked.
She glanced up, her mouth full of food. She popped the can of Coke and took a drink, holding up two fingers.
“Two days? You need more than chips after two days.”
Will went out and returned minutes later with a plate of heated leftovers. In his other hand he held a fork and napkin. He handed them to her, setting the plate down on the bunk mattress.
“Thank you.”
She placed the napkin in her lap and began eating in a more civilized way. As she ate she looked around the small room. Will did not think she was impressed. He saw her eyes rest on the calendar next to the door. On the calendar was a photo of a bikini-clad woman sprawled seductively on a beach blanket. All the previous days of the month were crossed out with a red marker. Will sat there, unsure what to say, watching her eat, “What’s your name?” he came out with at last.
“Justina,” she replied, then said, “thanks for the food.”
“You’re welcome.”
Will glanced down and saw the sheets on her bunk were fresh and clean. There was a fresh blanket as well, folded at the end.
“Where did those come from?”
Justina stopped eating when she sensed how angry he was. She did not answer, but her eyes never left his. Will’s expression hardened more and more the longer she waited to respond.
“Can you answer me?”
“I went out there,” she replied in a small voice.
“Where?”
“In the hallway. Just outside in the hallway there is a cabinet. I found sheets in there.”
“Do you remember what I told you, about staying in this room at all times? There are five other people on this boat besides me and they can never know you’re in here. Do you understand that? I told you if you needed something I would get it for you.”
Will rose and handed Justina’s purse to her. He picked up her jeans off the deck and told her to put them on. She did.
“I can’t believe this,” Will said, pulling the fresh sheets from the bunk and tossing them onto the deck in front of her, “after what I told you.”
He walked to the door, opened it quietly, and peered down the hallway into the galley. Nathan sat there at the table reading a book. He closed the door quietly and stood with his forehead pressed to the door, as if thinking. 
“Please,” she said.
Will turned and faced her without saying anything. Finally he gestured for her to sit down on the bottom bunk. She did so. He handed her the sheets and put her purse back on the locker. Then we went to the vacant bunk and lay down, his head propped against the bulkhead. He rubbed his face with both hands and for many minutes gazed at the overhead, not saying a word. Justina watched him with caution.
“This is how it’s going to work,” Will said at last, aloud yet not necessarily to her. It was also for his benefit, “First of all, you have to stay here, in this room, at all times.”
He jabbed a finger towards the deck. She nodded. Then he rose from the bunk and faced her directly.
“Look,” Will said, “I see you nodding but you did that before and then went out anyway. Please tell me you understand how serious this is or I will put you out on the dock right now. I swear to God I will.”
She nodded, and then spoke with a maturity he had not yet seen, “I understand. I apologize. It will not happen again.”
Will nodded.
“Look,” he said, “I didn’t mean to yell just now. It’s just that I could get into a lot of trouble over something like this. A lot of trouble.”
He was distracted by his thoughts.
“If you just stay in here I can bring you food or whatever you need. When we get underway in a couple days there will be less to worry about, because then everybody will just stay in their rooms unless they are on watch. It’s gonna take around fourteen days to get down there, last I heard. Once we get there, I’ll wait until night when nobody is around and you can walk off and go home, just the opposite of how you came on board. And that’s it. If we keep it that simple there is nothing to worry about. Nobody ever has to know.”
“What will they do if they find me in here? What will happen to me?”
“I don’t know about that. If we follow the rules then nothing will happen. If we keep it simple there is nothing to worry about, like I said before.”
After he reasoned everything through, Will sat back and shut his eyes. He lay there for a long time as if asleep. Soon, Justina stood up and began remaking her bunk with the fresh sheets. Before placing the sheets onto the mattress she whipped them a few times in the air. She then took her time and refitted the sheets, smoothed the wrinkles, and fluffed the pillow at the end. Once finished she climbed into the bunk and pulled the blanket over her, untroubled, almost as if the outburst had never occurred
Later Will rose from the vacant bunk and went to the door to make sure it was locked. Taking off his shirt in the middle of the room, he stopped halfway. Instead he kicked off his boots and set them next to the door. His movements seemed extra careful, as if he were trying to not make a sound. He climbed into the upper bunk and there removed his shirt and jeans, folding and placing them carefully at the foot of the bed. As he collapsed back onto his pillow, Will realized the lights in the room were still on. So, he put back on his jeans and shirt, climbed down, and switched them off.









October 24
Nathan and Martinez, the oiler, sat around the galley table at lunchtime. From inside his room, Will listened to their bullshitting and sporadic laughter and picked a time when the both got loud to emerge from his room down the hall. Just as he figured, they paid no attention when he twisted the knob to make sure it was locked. He then walked directly through the main galley area, purposely ignoring them both. This behavior was not unusual for Will, since he never talked to anybody when he first awoke. Martinez saw him, however, and interrupted his conversation with Nathan briefly when Will appeared.
“Three days, my friend,” Martinez said.
“Three days what?”
“You haven’t taken a shower for three days now, my friend. I’m counting for you. Maybe you forgot how.”
“Why the hell are you keeping track of how often I take a shower? Maybe they do that shit down in Mexico, but this is America. We don’t do faggot shit like that here.”
“Will,” Martinez said, “Mexico is America too. People in United States think they own everything.”
Will laughed, “Well maybe so, but you’re still a faggot.”
“My friend, I’m not a faggot. We have to smell your ass day in day out. You need to think of your fellow crewmembers.”
Martinez and Nathan both laughed.
 “You’re not around me all day. What if I took a shower last night before bed? You don’t know.”
“No, my friend,” Martinez said, “I know you went straight to your room, straight to your room. I come out of the engine room, twelve o five. I say Nathan, where the hell is Will? And she say, oh he went downstairs to bed. Already? I said. Already, Nathan said, that lazy motherfucker!”
Martinez formed his fingers into two legs walking down imaginary steps.
“I said that’s typical Will. He must have a lady he keep in his room. I know. I been in there before. It smells like sex.”
Everybody laughed harder. Will shook his head.
“Hey now,” Nathan said, “don’t be implicating me. You know I never said nothing like that.”
“Yeah, okay. Nathan didn’t call you motherfucker, Will. He don’t curse or God will send him to Hell. It’s okay, Nathan. I tell God you didn’t curse. He believe me. He’s good people.”
“He already know,” Nathan replied, “There ain’t nothing He don’t already know.”
With the attention off himself Will walked around to the stove to see what was for lunch. It was Nathan’s day to cook and he had prepared a large pork roast with vegetables, macaroni and cheese, and a green salad. Instead of dishing a plate, however, Will entered the walk-in cooler and emerged with an orange and a box of Eggo waffles. Martinez eyed him as he prepared breakfast. Will paid no attention.
“Hey Will,” Martinez said, “I just fuckin’ with you. You still my friend, right?”
“Yes, my friend.”
Martinez resumed telling Nathan a story Will had already heard at least three times since he began this hitch. It was about his recent visit to the naturalization office in Houston. Martinez had been trying to become a US citizen for years now, unsuccessfully for different reasons. His current problem was a traffic violation from 1993 when he lived in Los Angeles.
“So I left the lady at the front counter and sat down in one of the chairs. There were maybe twenty, thirty other people in the room easy, all my Mexican brothers and sisters. About twenty minutes later the lady at the counter, she call out Bornegris? Barneegray? Burnoghay? Whatever your name is, please come to the counter now. But I never go. She call out my name for next five minutes, never once saying that shit right.”
“You didn’t go up there?” Nathan asked.
“I know you are excited, but be patient, my friend. I will tell you what happened. Now the lady comes out behind the bulletproof glass. The one with the speaker. She walk around with the paper in her hand. She comes up to me and say, is this your name? I look at the paper and it’s mine for sure. I say yeah, that’s my name. Oh boy, now she looks mad. She says, I’ve been calling you for the last five minutes. I say, I never heard you say my name. You say everything else, but not my name. Oh, her face was red. She say, oh I know you, you smart ass. How about I call you Pancho Villa then, how you like that? Will you answer to Pancho Villa? I say sure, I’ll answer to anything. Yeah right, she say. She walks back behind the bulletproof glass, all red in the face. Ten minutes later, Pancho Villa, please come to the counter now, Pancho Villa. Everybody in the place starts laughing. I walk up there. She’s laughing, oh man, all the ladies back there are laughing. She call me Pancho Villa the rest of the day. Even when they told me I have to come back another day because my paperwork is not right.”
“Man, that stinks,” Nathan said, “So all that time and you didn’t even get what you went there for.”
“No, my friend. But everybody have a good time.”

Outside was a bright, windy day. Seagulls flew high overhead, squawking and diving sporadically into the muddy river water. One even sat perched atop the Etowah’s mast. Will put on a flannel jacket and climbed to the top of the wheelhouse to await Martinez, since a blown mast light needed changing before the trip out.
From this height Will could see across to the opposite side of the river, to the other docks, then past those he saw the hazy outline of Cameron proper – not that there was much to see. He noticed boat traffic was typical for a Saturday, with a steady line of vessels headed out of the channel. Just then a small fishing boat passed by, a man and two boys inside. The man drove while the two boys were hard at work rigging the tackle. Will waved to them, but he was so high they did not see him. In the other direction he saw the ocean stretch to the horizon. Just under the horizon-line he made out a cargo ship, outbound. Or inbound, sometimes it was hard to tell. He then remembered a hitch he had pulled here two years ago, before he was a regular hand on the Etowah.
He was a fill-in hand on that crew and felt like an outsider the entire time. It was a good crew, everybody got along great. It impressed him so much he even asked the captain if he could come back again, but the captain evaded his question and would not commit to having him back, and sure enough he did not return.
Will thought about the girl who at this moment was down there in his room. Last night it had seemed innocent, as if he stopped by the roadside to help a stranger with a flat tire. But now, in the daylight, it felt different, and because of that he had been distracted all morning – nervous that either she was going to walk out at some point like she had, or that possibly one of the crew would go into his room. The many scenarios played over in his mind to the point where he couldn’t concentrate on work. Eventually he found the only way to function at all was to put it out of his mind completely and pretend she wasn’t there. What comforted him the most was the fact he could still get her off the boat if he had to. Things could be explained away. It was not too late for that.
The wheelhouse door creaked open and Will heard footsteps up the ladder. Martinez joined him, carrying an orange and green safety harness, a navigation light-bulb box, and a screwdriver, held in his mouth like a pirate. He dropped the equipment onto the deck and zipped up the black hooded sweatshirt he wore. He laughed at nothing in particular and looked towards the sky, raising his arms,
“What a beautiful day in Paradise!”
Will took up the harness and unraveled it. It took five minutes or more before he figured out the right way to put it on, and another few minutes to properly adjust it. Martinez helped when he could, but mostly he just discouraged Will from using it at all.
“You have my knife on you?” Will asked.
“I only have my knife,” Martinez replied, “Why would I have yours?”
“You know what I mean. I mean do you have the knife I gave you last hitch.”
Martinez pulled the old knife from his pocket and opened it before he handed it over. Will held up the blade. At one time it had been a fine serrated-edge knife, perfect for cutting through line or for cutting anything else that might need cut on a boat. It was the perfect sailor’s knife. Now it was sharpened to a point. It looked like a filet knife.
“What the hell did you do to it?”
“I sharpened it.”
“I see that,” Will said, “but how are you going to cut line with it like this? There’s no more serrated-edge.”
“I don’t need to fuck with lines. That’s your job, my friend. I stay in the engine room.”
“Whatever you say.”
Will cut through a piece of line that had got tangled up with the harness. The edge was so sharp it hardly mattered there was no serrated-edge. He handed the knife back to Martinez, who folded it and put it back in his pocket. A few minutes later Will had the harness secure and the straps tightened.
“Hey,” Will said, reaching around behind him, “looks like I got it, but I can’t reach the back strap. Give me a hand will you?”
 “Ah, Will,” Martinez laughed, “you innocent.”
Will stopped what he was doing and looked at Martinez.
“Is that a compliment or an insult?”
“Compliment, my friend,” Martinez said, “Maybe you don’t know. People out here are bad people, bad in their hearts. But you are good in your heart. I think instead you should work in an office with air-conditioning, lots of ladies, find you a wife. Not out here with old beat-up boat trash.”
“I worked in an office before. I didn’t like it. Felt like I was wasting my life.”
“But you were around the pretty ladies?”
“Sometimes, yeah,” Will agreed.
“Sometimes is better than never, my friend.”
Will slid the screwdriver into his back pocket, held the light bulb box in one hand, and then hoisted himself onto the platform at the base of the mast. Here were alternating rungs that served as a ladder. Will hoisted himself onto the first rung. At each advance he stopped to fasten the safety clip to the rung above. It was a slow process.
“Hey,” Will shouted, “which light did Drew say was out?”
“The very top, all the way!”
One of the things Will learned about himself when he first went to work offshore was that he had a paralyzing fear of heights. Before that he had never known himself to be afraid of a specific thing, but the first time he had to climb fifty feet up a rusty metal pole, he learned.
“My friend,” Martinez called out, “what you doing? You okay? Be careful up there.”
Will stopped his ascent halfway up the mast, at the point where it began to waver back and forth with his weight. He always considered that the point of no return.
“I’m good.”
Another rung ascended he paused again. It felt as if his feet could slip off the rungs at any time. Then Will felt he was falling backwards and instinctively wrapped both arms around the mast pole. The jolt of this action caused him to lose footing on the bottom-most rung. His foot flailed for the rung and eventually found it. Will noticed the safety harness clip was not secured. Had he really slipped he would have fallen to the deck below.
Looking up, it was a long way to go. And there was the question of how best to get at the uppermost light. The vessel designers did not realize, or care, that it was impossible to change the light bulb the way it was positioned. The alternating rungs stopped just before the lower two mast lights, and all around them was a mess of wires. Above them was a small platform not quite big enough for a man to sit on, and on top of that was the upper mast light. Will had not changed the upper light before. It hardly ever needed changing. Several times he had changed the lower lights.
“How the hell am I supposed to climb past those bottom lights?” Will shouted, “It doesn’t seem very safe past the end.”
He inched his way up to the last set of rungs. The mast pole wavered under his weight. Will unfastened from the last rung and hesitated. He made a few attempts to climb further, but could not find a sure foothold. Then he descended.
Martinez watched him the whole way down. Once at the bottom Will did not look in his direction.
“It’s too unsafe up there,” Will said, “I ain’t changing it. I’m just gonna tell Drew he’ll have to do it. I’ll write a letter to the main office if I have to. These old boats, it’s too unsafe up there, and no safety harness, bunch of bullshit.”
“Yes, my friend,” Martinez agreed, “this is true. But light has to be changed before we go offshore. It’s your job to do it. When you are mate you can tell the AB to change the mast light.”
“I ain’t going up there again. Not today. It’s too windy.”
Will removed the harness and set the bulb box and screwdriver on the deck. Martinez picked up the tools, ignoring the harness. He placed them in the large front pockets of his hooded sweatshirt and approached the mast. His ascent was quick and sure-footed. When he reached the place where Will had turned back, the lower lights, he used those as the next stepping point, and climbed higher still, reaching the top-most platform. The mast pole swayed two feet in each direction. Martinez grabbed the small platform and pulled himself up. That platform became his elbow rest. He pulled the bulb and screwdriver from his pocket. The screwdriver he used to pry open the light housing. It was screw-top but froze up from being exposed to the elements. It broke free with little effort. He then reached into the housing, unscrewed the blown bulb, and tossed it overboard. It fell into the river where it made a small splash. Once the new bulb was in place he tightened the housing and descended, as quickly and sure-footed as his ascent.
At the bottom Will did not say anything. Martinez handed him the screwdriver and they both descended to the main deck area for a break.
#
Walking into the galley, Will spotted his laundry box in the hallway next to his room. He had washed a load of clothes earlier but forgot about it when they went up to change the mast light. He turned the knob to his room. It was still locked. The clothes inside the box were neatly folded and stacked. Only Nathan took the time to do that.
As expected, Nathan sat in the wheelhouse talking with his wife on the phone. When Will came up Nathan glanced over his shoulder and waved to him, as if to get his attention.
“Yo, Will.”
“What’s up?”
“You heard?” Nathan said, “Your daddy’s back.”
“My daddy? Oh, my daddy. So Frank made it?”
“He came on board when you were up there monkeying around with the mast light.”
“I see,” Will replied, “Hey, thanks for folding my clothes and setting them next to my room. I appreciate it.”
But Nathan was not listening. He had returned to the conversation with his wife. There was some trouble with the water bill. Nathan seemed agitated and spoke with harshness to his wife. Will went downstairs into the lounge.
#
Most of the state rooms on the Etowah were on the 01 deck, above the galley level and below the wheelhouse level. All the other crew stayed in these rooms. This deck consisted mainly of one long hallway with doors, a head, and a lounge area with a TV and DVD player. In the lounge there was also a bookshelf filled with paperbacks and National Geographic magazines.
Will approached the captain’s room down at the end of the hall. There were fabricated signs on all the officer’s doors, one for the captain, the mate, and the engineer. The door was closed but he could hear movement within and then an acoustic guitar being strummed and tuned. Will knocked lightly upon the door and the strumming stopped abruptly. But nobody came to the door. Will thought to knock again, but didn’t. He stood there until he heard the guitar again and then descended into the galley.
Martinez sat at the table writing in the engineer’s log book. Next to him lay a banana peel and a can of Coke. Will went to the fridge and got himself a Coke.
“Captain Frank is back,” Will said.
“He is here now?”
“I just knocked on his door but he didn’t answer. Heard a guitar though.”
“Oh man,” Martinez said, “The guitar. He need to leave that fucking guitar at his house. This is not American Idol.”
“I like his songs.”
“I know. Which one you like? The one about the squirrel who can’t find a nut. Stupid.”
“It’s good though,” Will said, “It’s sad.”
“It’s not good. You just his, what Nathan call you all the time, his pet.”
Martinez laughed. He rose from his seat and walked to the galley door. A beam of sunlight came through the door and caused him to squint.
“Goddamn that sun is bright today. Why the sun have to be so bright all the time?”
“I ain’t his pet,” Will said, “I just like his songs. I don’t know why you guys are so hard on him.”
“Will. I don’t care if he plays music, but he do that shit when he supposed to be captain. His job is to drive the boat, not to write songs about fucking squirrels.”
Will rose, downed the last of the Coke, and joined Martinez at the door.
“Come my friend,” Martinez said, “break time is over. I need your help in the engine room. We need to throw out old filters before we underway.”
Martinez opened the engine room hatch, allowing Will to go first, and they both descended the stairs to the deck below.
#
Will had done so well putting Justina out of his mind that he was surprised when he turned the doorknob and found it locked. But it all came back. He rapped the secret knock and even before he finished she was at the door. It comforted him to see her react so quickly, and he entered.
Her presence in the room was strange for him, and not for the obvious reasons. He was of course nervous about having a stowaway on board. He was of course shy to take off his clothes in front of her and tried to do so out of sight. But the uncomfortable feeling he had did not come from those things. Instead it came from a sensation, a sensation he could not shake, that she just did not belong here. She was out of place in this environment. Where everything to do with the boat was hard and angular and unforgiving, she was by contrast vulnerable and fragile and soft. It felt like she might be hurt just from being here, like a jellyfish washed up on the beach.
Tonight Will wanted to be alone with his thoughts, so he went directly to his locker, grabbed some fresh clothes, his bag of toiletries, and walked out of the room again, barely acknowledging her presence. He went straight to the head for a shower. Afterwards he returned already dressed in pajama bottoms and a t-shirt. Without so much as a word to her, he climbed into his bunk and pretended to go to sleep. For now he wanted to put everything out of his mind and get some rest. But soon he felt a small tap on his shoulder and rolled over. She stood there, at eye level with him, balancing her feet on the edge of the bottom bunk.
“I need to tell you something before you go to sleep,” she said.
“What?”
She stared at his pillow for a few moments before answering, her eyes downcast.
“Earlier I had to pee. I couldn’t hold it. And I didn’t know what to do, so I used the trash can in the corner.”
After a moment he climbed down and joined her in the center of the room. She would not look at him, only at the deck.
“I’m sorry.”
“Don’t be sorry,” Will said, “you don’t have nothing to be sorry about. I should be the one sorry. I should have thought things through better. Thank you for not going out. Don’t worry. We’ll come up with something so you don’t have to wait from now on. Do you think you can hold it during the day until I get off watch?”
“I don’t know. I am embarrassed. You probably want to get rid of me now.”
Will considered for a moment.
“Follow me,” he said.
The galley was empty. It was after one in the morning, so nobody would be up except for Nathan. Will listened. He heard a splash coming from the deck above, Nathan in the middle of his sanitary. It was safe.
The head down the hallway had a door you could lock from the inside just like the state rooms. Will did not attempt to explain his idea to her, but instead just took her by the hand and led her down the hallway. Once inside, Will locked the door and turned on the shower so the noise would drown out any other sound. Then he walked out again, closing the door behind him so that she was inside alone. Then he gently rapped the secret knock and waited. She opened the door, understanding his idea completely. He went to the cabinets under the sink and pulled out a clean towel. Then he showed her the soap and shampoo he used. Will looked at the clock on the wall. It was now two twenty. He walked to the clock and pointed to the seven, fifteen minutes from now. She thanked him and Will left, locking the door behind him.
While she was in the shower he went back to the room and changed the trash bag, trying not to breathe in and swearing he’d never be that negligent again. Fortunately she had already tied it up so all he had to do was throw it into the large barrel outside.
Twenty minutes later they were both back in the room. Everything had gone according to plan. Will gave her a pair of his own sweat pants and a green t-shirt for something clean to wear. She refused at first, but Will assured her he would wash her clothes the next day and give them back. Now that she had showered and her hair flat against her head, he saw she was not unattractive, as had been his first impression, but pretty in a strange way. She sat on her own bunk, went through her purse, and pulled out an old brush. Then she whipped her hair around, grabbing it with one hand, and began to brush out the tangles with a somewhat violent motion. This struck Will has very feminine. He admired her long hair, a chestnut brown which matched almost exactly the color of her skin.
He went to the cabinet and unzipped his toiletries bag. Inside was a small mirror he never used. It was covered in grime so he wiped it clean with a sock and handed it to her.
“Thanks.”
“No problem.”
She set it in front of her the best she could and resumed brushing. Will climbed into his bunk, but then wondered if she might want other things such as deodorant or cotton swabs. She didn’t seem to have much in her purse. He climbed down again and offered her the entire bag to use.
“No, thank you,” she said.
“Look here,” Will said, unzipping the bag so she could see inside, “you can use whatever you need. You don’t even have to ask.”
She nodded and set it down beside her.
“Thanks.”
Will told her he would be back and went out to the galley. He did not bother to lock the door. A few minutes later he returned with a plate of food, leftovers from lunch that day. When she saw the food her face brightened. He set the plate next to her on the bunk.
“I figured you could use something to eat.”
She left off brushing her hair and picked up a slab of the roast pork and ate it like a piece of corn on the cob. There was not much food on the plate and a few minutes later it was gone. When she had finished, Will took the plate to the galley and washed it. When he returned she was back to brushing her hair and looked at his reflection in the mirror, making him a bit uncomfortable.
“What?” he said.
“I was wondering,” she paused, “just if you would mind if I have a little drink.”
“You mean a drink drink?”
“Just a bottle I have in my purse. Jim Beam.”
“I don’t know. I don’t know if it’s a good idea to get drunk.”
“Well, just a little drink.”
“Why are you asking me?” Will said, “I mean you could easily just drink some without telling me. Did you already have some during the day?”
“Yeah.”
“How much is in there?” Will asked, “Show me what you got.”
She pulled a small bottle out of her purse, almost half full.
“This is what I got with me,” she said, “do you keep anything to drink on the boat?”
“No way. Alcohol is probably the worst thing you can bring on a boat.”
“I understand,” she nodded, “You been real nice to me so far, so if you say not to drink any, I won’t.”
Will did not respond for a few moments. Finally he looked up and smiled, “I don’t mind if you drink any, but look, only if I can have some too.”
“Do you have any cola to mix in?” she asked, “That would be good with it.”
“Sure, be right back.”
Will went out again and returned with two plastic cups and a couple cans of Coke. She took them and divided the remainder of the bottle between them. Will took a large swig, wincing at how strong it was, then added a bit more Coke. He was not used to alcohol. For him, months would go by without a single drop. It was obvious from how she drank that she had more experience.
They sat together on the empty bunk and sipped. Some awkwardness lingered in the air, they still being strangers, but after time it became somewhat more relaxed. Will took off his boots and threw them into the corner. He leaned back against the bulkhead, his favorite thinking position. Justina mimicked him.
“You know what?” Will said, breaking the silence.
“What?”
“I needed that drink,” he said, “Holy shit. I been on this boat for too long.”
“Glad I could help,” she said.
Justina created a little cubby hole for her drink between the mattress and the wall. She rose and took an elastic band from around her wrist and wrapped her hair into a pony tail.
“It’s kind of warm in here, actually.”
“Yeah,” Will agreed, “it’ll get cooler during the night.”
“Good.”
Will turned to face her.
“Hey,” he said, “I apologize for what happened today.”
“Can we not talk about it?”
“But we need to. There can’t be any more mistakes. Look, I know we’re doing this on the down low, but it doesn’t have to be that way.”
“But I paid you,” she said, confused.
“Yes.”
“Let’s not talk about it anymore, okay?”
There was some noise in the galley. It was Nathan cooking leftovers in the microwave. Soon the smell reached them, and Will rose to make sure the door was locked. He returned and there was some awkwardness as he tried to come up with something to talk about. The situation made conversation even more difficult than it would be in normal circumstances.
“When did you come to the US?” he asked.
“I don’t want to talk about that,” she replied.
“Then how did you come? On a boat? Plane?”
“I said I don’t want to talk about it,” she said, “nothing about it.”
Her expression hardened.
“Why did you come?”
“Look, I ain’t doing this,” she said, “This is weird. I don’t even know you.”
“Sorry,” Will said, taking another sip, “I’m sorry. I think the alcohol is getting to me. Not used to drinking.”
 “I can see that.”
Time passed with neither saying much. They sat at opposite ends of the bunk, sipping their drinks and thinking their own thoughts. Outside the room they could hear the radios blaring, incessant with traffic noise. It became uncomfortable sitting there without speaking. Will finished his drink off with a swig and set the cup onto the deck. She finished hers too and set hers inside his.
“I definitely feel it now.”
“Cool,” she said, “me too actually.”
By this time there was nothing left to drink and they were slightly drunk. Will more so than Justina. He stumbled into the galley and washed out their cups. When he returned he saw she had sprawled out across the length of the spare bunk, her shirt raised so that her bare waist was visible to him, her skin there pale and smooth. She was asleep. Will wedged himself into a spot next to her at the end of the bunk where he barely fit. Then, to his surprise, she shifted and lay her head in his lap. Will was ready for bed himself but did not dare to move for a long time. Then his leg began to hurt and he had to move. Soon he too was asleep. It must have been an hour or more before Justina awoke and realized where she was and what she had done. She rose quietly, switched off the room lights, and went to her own bunk, leaving Will there sat upright against the bulkhead. By then it was after three.












October 25
Weather reports said it would rain in the afternoon but so far it was just cold and overcast. Will and Jesse stood on the back deck, hovering over an opened hatch that led into the engine room. Jesse was the engineer on the Etowah. Like Will he was from Georgia, but Will did not feel like he came from the same Georgia that Jesse came from. Yet because they were from the same state, Jesse always talked to him like they were in on a secret that everybody else was not.
The blowers in the engine room provided a continuous rush of air that blew their hair back. They had to yell to talk to one another, and had to shout to talk to Martinez, who was down below with the job of filling buckets with oil-based liquid mud. It was Will’s job to haul up the buckets whenever Martinez gave the signal, and then to carry them up to the next level and dump them into fifty-five gallon drums. Jesse was there to supervise.
“Will,” Jesse began, “I promise you, if that nigger tells me one more time about how Renee sent him to five different boats in one day, I don’t know what I’m gonna do. I just don’t know, bro. I can’t be held responsible.”
Will laughed. “He tells me too. I’ve heard it probably six times this hitch. I tell him I already know the story but he just tells it anyway. He’s like my grandpa.”
“Hell, he ain’t that old, just a year older than me. Okay Renee, Click. Okay Renee, I’ll be there. Click. I can’t take it anymore. Fuck, what can you do? You tell him you already know it and he just tells you anyway, like you said.”
“It’s weird.”
“But it’s typical.”
“Yeah.”
“Look at them rappers, with that gold shit they be wearing all the time. They even cover their goddman teeth with gold. How fucked up is that? I mean, don’t get me wrong. I ain’t racist. They just a bit off in the head. I think anyway.”
“Yeah.”
The conversation broke off while they watched Martinez below deck, at the pump, filling an empty bucket with a thick, dark sludge. In total there were three buckets and Martinez made sure they were all three filled before he sent the first one up. That way he could take a break while the others worked.
“There’s another one for you right there,” Jesse pointed at Martinez, “Think about this, all these Mexicans are coming over here to work. They work for way less than you and me. I don’t have to worry cause I’m a Coast Guard licensed engineer and they ain’t gonna let no wetback engineers out here. Have to be a citizen at least. But you, bro, I’d watch out if I was you. They come out here and work for seventy-five dollars a day and all of a sudden the company is asking itself why I need to pay white boy Will two-fifty a day. Know what I mean?”
“I hear you.”
“Don’t get me wrong. Martinez is a good oiler, I don’t have a problem with Martinez, but when it comes down to it, you got to look out for your own. Do you think when it comes down to it they gonna be looking out for you? That’s just how it is. Sucks, but that’s life.”
Martinez shouted up from the engine room, “Hey, this is not break time now. Haul that shit up. Let’s go people!”
Jesse and Will turned their attention back to the opened hatch. There was a line tied to the hatch reaching all the way to the engine room deck. On the end of the line was a hook. Martinez had attached the bucket of liquid mud to the hook. The mud was so heavy it took both of them to haul it up the twenty feet or so to the top. Their pulls were coordinated perfectly, alternating back and forth, so there was no break in stride. Halfway up, the lip of the bucket caught on a rung on the ladder. Some of the sludge sloshed out of the bucket and fell onto Martinez’s shoulders.
“My friend, be careful up there!”
“What’s the matter, my friend?” Jesse shouted, “Thought you was a wet back?”
Martinez shook his head, “You funny man.”
The disposal drums were tied together on the 01 deck, behind the cabin, next to the air conditioning units. There was no easy way for two men to carry the one bucket, so it fell on Will to haul it up the stairs. The metal handle of the bucket warped under the weight of the mud. Jesse followed along, stopping each time Will had to stop to rest his arms. He gave Will a hard time about not spilling a drop. Will just nodded and kept going.
It was a big deal to Jesse if any of the mud spilled onto the deck, as it was oil-based, and if any got between the deck boards then it was near impossible to clean up, and eventually would be washed overboard and create a slick. Three years ago Jesse had been responsible for a bad fuel spill at the Martin Fuel Dock in Cameron. Jesse lost his license for two years after the incident.
Once at the top, Jesse stepped in front of Will and found the emptiest drum in which to dump the mud. He popped the lid on the drum and then helped Will heave the bucket high enough to dump it. Once it was all inside, Jesse loosely rested the drum lid on top, as they had several more trips to make. They returned to the deck to make another trip.
“But hell,” Jesse continued, “You can’t stop em. Motherfuckers come over like ants. It must be bad over there for them to do the kind of shit they do to get over here. I don’t know what to think. It must be hell on earth.”
“Yeah.”
“You remember that news story from a few years ago, when about fifty of them fuckers got in the back of a tractor trailer and paid some driver to carry them across the border. That driver got scared and ditched them fuckers on the side of the highway. They had no way to get out and suffocated to death. Remember that shit?”
“I remember.”
“That was some shit, huh?” Jesse said, “Talk about hot tamales. Hot tamales, hot tamales! Andelay! That’s some shit, huh, bro? Will, what you think about that?”
Will opened his mouth to say something, then just stopped where he was and set down the bucket. Jesse stopped too.
Will began, “Man, why don’t you just shut your fucking mouth for a change? Jesus Christ. If you ask me you sound like some goddamn ignorant hick. I can’t take this shit anymore, your fucking mouth. You talk like me and you are in a secret club. Well we ain’t. I’m so tired of hearing your shit. Fucking niggers fucking Mexicans fucking Muslims. Fuck you, man. I can’t take it anymore. I feel like I’m the one locked in some trailer on the side of the highway. And if somebody would just come along and open the doors I could fucking leave and get on with my life, but nobody comes, so I have to suffocate in here with miserable pricks like you.”
Jesse chewed on his jaw and looked at Will as if he were from another planet.
“What the fuck, dude,” Jesse said, “I was just talking shit. What you been smoking? Talk to me that way. You in the trailer but you can’t get out. You know what, fuck you dude.  I was just talking shit. You young. You can’t just talk to people however the fuck you want. Raise your voice at me. That’s a good way to get a broke jaw. Get the fuck on. Me and Martinez got this.”
Jesse walked to the stack and shouted down the hatch for Martinez to shut it down. He had to shout a few times. Will stood there for a moment and then stormed off towards the bow, shaking.
#
When he became aware of his surroundings again, Will was surprised to find himself sitting on the anchor windlass. He felt disconnected from reality. He saw everything as normal, but could not focus his attention on anything specific. He got up, walked to the tip of the bow, and draped his arms over the bulwarks. In the far distance, where the channel opened to the Gulf, his eyes caught two large workboats passing one another. At first glance it appeared as if it were only one boat growing larger, then splitting like a human cell.
Sometime later, Will went downstairs to the deck locker and pulled out the needle gun and grinder. Nobody was on the back deck. The hatch to the engine room was still open. He dragged out the orange extension cord and the air hose, and led them over to the port containment bin. As usual the air hose was all tangled up and it took ten minutes to unravel it. 
The containment bin was a four-foot square box about two feet deep, used to catch overflow in the event a product tank is filled beyond capacity. There were five different colored pipes which came out of the engine room, and whose bell-shaped openings were directed into the bin.
Deck maintenance is an ongoing cycle because you can never fully rid a vessel made of iron from rust, especially one that sails on salt water. The port containment bin was the last big maintenance job to be done, otherwise the Etowah was in decent condition for a thirty year old boat. There was so much rust on the pipes and inside the walls of the bin that if you were to take a five-pound hammer and beat against it, sheets of rust would flake off. A running joke in the company was that hands were forbidden to do any work on the hull since rust was the only thing holding the old boats together.
Will realized he needed some earplugs to begin work. The box of earplugs was in the utility pantry next to the galley. He approached the galley door from an angle where he might be able to see who was inside. Nobody was there so he went in and got some.
Once crawled inside the containment bin space, which was cramped, he began banging away on the pipes. Rust flakes and dust fell all over him. He couldn’t avoid getting it into his mouth and had to spit constantly. He was used to it though. Will never felt a job was beneath him. He could just as easily scrub a toilet or steer a boat into the channel, and be as content in either case. In fact, Will enjoyed the times he could begin a project like the containment bin as it allowed him time to work alone, and he enjoyed the satisfaction that came with completing it well.
He replayed the event over in his head as he chipped and hammered away at the rust. This only stirred his anger. Most of his anger did not stem from the original cause, but from the fact that he would have to face Jesse again and work with him again, and more than likely everyone would know about it. Soon he was cursing Jesse again, and because the tools made so much noise he found himself yelling inside the bin, cursing and shouting clever comebacks that had only now occurred to him. There would be times Will’s anger would overcome him and he would bang the hammer against the pipe as hard as he could, hurting his hand. Then he would think about the things he had been saying and wonder what in the world he was so angry about. He would then decide to let it go, but before long he began yet another tirade. This went on for hours.
It never rained as forecast but it was now quite chilly outside. Rays from the sun shone out of a break in the overcast. As cold as it was Will had not stopped to go inside for his jacket and gloves. He shivered as he worked, but ignored the chill and cold metal against his skin. He had finished chipping all the rust from the bin and pipes. Now he was buffing all the areas with the grinder to smooth the paint. He was cursing yet again. By this point the cursing was directed at other members of the crew, his family, friends, anyone who had done anything in memory to piss him off.
Will had decided for sure he was going to put Justina back on the dock. It was just not worth the headache. He felt idiotic for bringing her on board in the first place. He would just tell it like it is and no one would ever know. Just the thought of that eased his mind.
“Will,” a voice shouted.
He could tell from the tone that whoever it was had been shouting for awhile. Will shut off the grinder and stuck his head out where he could see.
“Look here. Finish up what you doing and put everything away. We done for this evening.”
“Hey Drew.”
“Hey nothing,” Drew said, “Who told you to work on that there containment bin?”
“Nobody.”
“You know we about to head offshore for two weeks or more. How you gonna finish when we underway, water coming on the deck? Didn’t think about that, did you young-un?”
Drew lit up a cigarette and shivered. He rubbed his arms together.
“It’s cold out here, Willy D. Boy why you working out in this cold in only a t-shirt?”
“I don’t know.”
“And what you cussing at? I heard you cussing all the way up the deck.”
Will did not respond.
“And yes,” Drew added, “I heard about your little confrontation this afternoon with Mr. Jesse. Why you had to shout at Mr. Jesse like that, Willy D? You know that man ain’t right in the head. That ain’t you. That ain’t the Willy D we know and love.”
Will said, “I just lost my cool. I don’t know. Fuck. Now I feel stupid about it.”
“You got to learn how to let that shit go,” Drew said, “He’s always talking shit, but that’s just talk. Look at him and Martinez. That man wouldn’t know what to do without Martinez up his butt. They practically married at the hip.”
“You’re right. I don’t have any good excuse.”
“Tell me this, how long you been on the boat?”
“Five years, thereabouts.”
“This hitch dummy, not your whole life.”
“Nine weeks.”
“Nine weeks,” Doug repeated, “And how come you didn’t get off last crew change?”
“Renee was in a bind.”
“Man, that motherfucker Renee’s always in a bind. Look, you burned out Willy D. You stressed. That’s all they is to it. Tell you what, first thing tomorrow I’ll call Renee and try to get somebody else out here for this trip, what you think?”
“Does Jesse want me off the boat? Is that why you’re asking?”
“Boy,” Drew said, “What you think? Jesse don’t have no say in that. Will, I’m looking out for you, son. That’s all. You can’t be working that straight time without no break. You need time to chill out and relax. For real, look here. You my ace hand. It’d be great if you came with us down there, and I know you looking forward to it, but if you need a break you need a break.”
“I think I’m okay,” Will said, “Is Jesse mad?”
“Yeah, but so what? He’ll get over it. Just like you gonna get over it. Now look here, let me tell you what you’re gonna do.”
“Man, I still gotta put up all this crap. It’s almost dark too. And I still got my sanitary to do.”
“Son,” Drew said, “Listen to your superior officer. Here’s what you’re gonna do. First you gonna stow all this shit. Then once that’s done you gonna go inside that there galley and Uncle Drew done whipped up some good ol turkey noodle soup with them leftovers. You gonna get you a big ol bowl of that and have you some dinner. Now, what you say?”
“That sounds all right.”
“All right? Hell you say. Sounds damn delicious. In face Uncle Doug’s about to go have himself a bowl right this minute, with some crackers crumbled up and some sweet iced tea. Hot damn that’s some good eatin on a cold October night. As soon as I finish up this here cigarette that’s what we gonna do.”
Drew took a long drag from the cigarette and flung it overboard. He exhaled and stretched his back, then headed towards the galley.
“Hey Drew,” Will said, “hold up.”
“Will, ain’t you never watched a nature show on TV? You don’t step between an animal and his food source. What you need?”
“I was just wondering if you talked to Captain Frank yet. He came on board yesterday, but nobody has seen him. He’s been locked up in his room.”
Drew returned to Will. He looked more serious than before and shook his head.
“I swear I can’t figure that man out. He’s acting real funny. His wife left him, you know. Said she cheated on him. I don’t know why he came back for this trip. Saw him yesterday for a few minutes. He’s like, you got this? And I said, yeah Frank, no problem. After that I an’t seen him at all.”
“I didn’t know about his wife,” Will said, “We all expected it, but damn. I’m telling you I haven’t heard shit since he got back. I knocked on his room yesterday but he never even came to the door. Just heard his guitar.”
“That surprises me he won’t even come out to say nothing to you. The way you and him are. I’m worried about that man. I just know he’s gonna fuck me with this trip. I’ll be driving this bitch the whole way down. Just watch.”
“Me and Nathan can drive when we’re on watch,” Will suggested, “and there’s always the settee to sleep on.”
“I know this, my peon. I’m two steps ahead of you.”
“Maybe tonight I’ll knock on his door again. He likes to talk to me about his troubles.”
“That ain’t a bad idea,” Drew said, “Go on finish up here. I’ll be in the galley if you need me.”
#
Drew, Jesse, and Martinez were all leaned up against the counters when Will came inside. Each held a steaming bowl of soup. Will went straight to the head down the hallway to clean up before he joined them.
“Damn it, Will,” Martinez remarked, “you been working, huh?”
Will noticed his face in the mirror and understood what Martinez meant. He was covered in rust dust and grime. He looked like an aborigine. He spat grit out into the sink. It was a mess, but came off easily enough with water and soap. Soon he was clean but his t-shirt and jeans were still dirty. He went into the hallway to his room, briefly hesitating at the door, and then instead walked into the galley.
“Will,” Drew said, “Boy go in that room and put on some clean clothes before you eat. At least try to act civilized.”
“That soup smells too good to wait.”
Will walked up to the counter, and Jesse had to move out of the way so he could reach the bowls. He dipped out two spoonfuls of soup from the big metal pot, steam rising from the bowl. Instead of standing around with the others, Will went to the galley table and sat down. He dipped a piece of garlic toast into the soup and took a bite. At once he felt rejuvenated. He had not realized he was so exhausted.
Turkey noodle soup for the evening watch was a part of the normal routine. Once every two weeks somebody would roast a turkey and there would inevitably be leftovers. The next day or so Drew would take the leftovers and make soup. He put in chopped celery, shell pasta, and lots of pepper and salt. It was a great meal on a cold night.
 Jesse had everyone’s attention telling a story about the captain on the York River. Will had actually worked with Jesse on the York years ago. That was where they first met. The captain of the York was a well-known pervert. Every evening you could count on hearing two sounds coming from his room, a squeaky exercise bike and a porno video, at the same time.
“We was gonna test out the general alarm in the engine room. They had done some rewiring or some shit. I had Will up top in the wheelhouse to turn off the alarm after he got the okay.”
“Will,” Martinez interrupted, “you was on the York River?”
“Sure was.”
Jesse continued without acknowledging Will’s remark.
“So I had Will up top, and down in the engine room I had my oiler Marcus to sound the alarm. I was in the galley as the go-between and to listen for the alarm on that level. At the last minute, I realized that everybody was up, but Captain RJ was in his room, so I took off up the stairs to his room and inside I could hear the exercise bike, so I knew he must be in there watching his pornos. I banged on the door real hard and yelled, hey RJ we gonna do a test on the general alarm. But right when I started yelling, Marcus sounded the alarm. So to RJ it must have sounded like the boat was on fire or sinking or some shit. He flung open the door and stormed out, butt-ass naked, with his dick sticking straight up in the air, uh uh Jesse uh what’s the matter, is the boat on fire?”
“Oh, Lord,” Drew said, almost spitting soup.
“I was like, no RJ, please go back in your room. You old pervert. Don’t nobody need to see that. We just doing a test on the alarm system. RJ grabbed his chest. He was breathing hard. Oh Jesse uh you scared the shit out of me. Damn. Don’t ever do that. I was like, motherfucker, don’t ever do that. I won’t ever forget the sight of a sixty year old boner coming at me.”
“Will,” Martinez asked, “you ever see your captain’s hard on? It’s okay you don’t want to talk about it.”
“Fuck no,” Will said.
“Oh man, that’s some shit,” Martinez shook his head, “What’s the matter with white people?”
Drew took the empty bowls from Jesse and scrubbed them out in the sink. Jesse laughed, still thinking about the story, and walked over the engine room door where he marked the daily log sheet. Will continued to eat.
Then Martinez walked to the light switch and turned off the lights in the galley. Suddenly it was dark. Everyone stopped what they were doing.
“Hey,” Drew yelled, “turn them lights back on, Mexican. I can’t see in here.”
“Where did the lights go?” Martinez asked, “We can’t escape from the trailer and it’s dark, holy shit! We can’t leave the trailer until the doors is open but nobody open them for us. What we gonna do? Oh no!”
Martinez flipped the lights back on and grinned at Will.
Drew laughed, “Ah, Will. Willy D. What we gonna do with you, son?”
Jesse came back through the galley and as he passed the table, clapped Will gently on the shoulder.










October 26
One of the reasons Will chose the upper bunk was so that he could feel the breeze from the A/C vent on his face at night. Even if the unit went out in the middle of the summer, which it frequently did, the moving air kept the sweat off. He lay there now, with a large legal pad in his lap, concentrating on it. His left foot dangled off the edge of the bunk and tapped impatiently on the wooden panel of the bed frame. Justina glanced up after listening to it for several minutes and cleared her throat with meaning. Once he stopped, she went back to eating the bowl of turkey noodle soup. Each spoonful was preceded by a tender, cooling blow. She sat bunched up in the corner of the empty bunk and gazed at an open magazine beside her.
Earlier that evening, while scrubbing the head toilets, Will decided he would write down in detail how to handle every conceivable problem that might arise during the voyage, so that mishaps like what had happened the day before would not happen again. 
A routine had already been in process of being established since she came on board and Will recognized this and used it as his starting place. First thing after watch he would take a shower. Then he would allow Justina twenty minutes to do the same. While she was in the shower, he would prepare something to eat and have it ready by the time she came out. This was logical and had worked well so far. Using the bathroom was going to be difficult, but if she were able to hold it most of the time, there would likely be times he could let her go throughout the day.
But there were many things to think through. It only just occurred to him that Drew or Nathan might need to grab the paint stencils, which were stowed underneath the spare bunk. Will needed to think everything through, any possible scenario, and come up with a solution for it. Tomorrow he would take the stencil sheets and stow them under the galley settee, and then mention it casually in conversation. Things would become much simpler once underway. Nothing much to worry about then. The main thing to worry about now was if the company sent any extra hands for the trip, since his room was the first place any additional crew would be housed.
At last he was content with the state of things, climbed down, and put the legal pad back into the locker. He asked Justina if she needed anything else from the galley. No she said. He took the bowl and spoon from her and placed them into the locker as well, to be washed when he came back on watch. The fewer times he went out of the room the better.
Justina had discovered a pile of old National Geographic magazines in an unused locker and when Will came in there were several of them strewn out on the bunk. Now that she was finished with the shower and meal, she returned all her attention to them, ignoring Will completely. This annoyed him. There had been an uncomfortable atmosphere in the room ever since he came in. In fact she barely acknowledged his presence. Will put this down to what had happened the night before.
“What are you reading about?” he asked.
“Nothing.”
“Well,” Will began, “I think we should go over this list I made, so we both know what to do in case something happens. We can study it and memorize what to do in an emergency.”
“I know what to do,” Justina said, “I just sit here by myself all day long, the boat leaves, when it arrives in Trinidad, I get off.”
Will was silent until she looked up from the magazine to see why he did not respond.
He said, “Look, I’m not sure why you’re acting this way all of a sudden. You act like you’re pissed off or something. We were getting along okay last night, from what I remember.”
She closed the magazine and scowled.
“Just leave me alone. I was drunk last night. I don’t know you.”
Will looked furious.
“Okay,” he said, “Maybe it’s best if you just get off the boat. You realize you will have to stay in this room with me for over twelve days? I mean, it’s only been a couple days and already you act like you’re mad about something. What is that about? Don’t you understand this isn’t Greyhound? I’m not here to service you or provide you with entertainment. Maybe you need to get your father to wire you the money for a plane ticket, or something. I don’t know.”
“But I paid you.”
“You paid me,” Will mimicked her tone, “Where do you get that sense of entitlement? Do you realize how little money that is to me? I get up in the morning, have breakfast, do some deck work, and I’ve made that much money. Really. It’s pocket change to me. You can have it back for all I care.”
Tears came to her eyes. Will just stood there.
“Well,” she said, wiping her eyes, “It’s a lot to me. It’s all I have. And I can’t go back no other way. So I’ll do anything you want me to do. If that’s what it takes. As payment. I’ll do anything. Just please let me stay.”
Justina rose from the bunk and stood in front of Will as if offering herself to him. The top of her head only reached his chin. Nothing like this had ever happened to him before.
“Don’t say things like that,” he said.
Both stood in the center of the room, staring away from one another, waiting for something to happen. Then Will went out of the room, forgetting to lock it. Justina startled as the door slammed behind him.
He put on a heavy jacket he kept in the laundry room and walked outside. It was cold, but it felt good to get out of that stuffiness. He walked to the stern and looked out at the grass which grew in the mud near the bank. A small, white bird flew past him and landed with a splash in the river. The ripples from the splash put him into a deep contemplation of nothing. Just contemplation. Soon a boat shone its spotlight onto the bank downstream and caught his eye. Reality came back. He turned to go inside. As he approached the galley door he saw Nathan up in the wheelhouse at the rear console. Nathan saw him too and saluted. Will saluted back and walked inside.
“I’m back.”
Justina rose to meet him. In the meantime she had gathered her purse and clothes in anticipation of leaving. Will sat on the bunk and she continued to stand.
“Is it boring in here all day with nothing to do?” he asked.
“I am scared by myself.”
“About somebody walking in?”
She nodded, “I hear noises outside the door and every time I think somebody is going to find me in here. Today someone came and turned the knob on the door, but it was not you. They did not knock first.”
“Wonder who that was,” Will said.
“I don’t know,” she replied, “but I fucking freaked.”
“See, that’s the kind of shit I’m worried about. I can’t be around twenty-four seven. I have my own stuff to take care of out there, and I can’t let this interfere with that.”
“I know how it goes.”
“I also noticed you sprayed a whole can of Lysol in here,” Will said with a slight grin, “you can’t be doing that anymore. It took my breath away. It’s not like I can just open the door and ventilate the room.”
“But it smells really bad in here.”
“Yeah,” he agreed, “it does.”
They grew quiet, but the silence was not awkward.
“You are a kind person,” she said at last, attempting to make eye contact with him.
“I’m not that kind.”
“Why do you say that?”
“Are you genuinely interested,” Will asked, “or are you just saying that to get on my good side?”
“Interested.”
Will began, “Today me and the engineer got into an argument over something stupid, and it was my fault. We nearly came to blows. I cussed that man out like he was a dog. I cussed an officer on a Coast Guard regulated vessel like he was a dog. But what really bothers me is, did I fuck it up for good? I mean between him and me. Can you fuck it up for good between two people, so it can’t ever go back to how it was before?”
Justina looked thoughtful, and then replied, “If there is no forgiveness.”
#
The room was now dark and both Will and Justina were asleep and had been for hours. A loud knock came at the door and startled them both. Will leapt down as fast as possible, so to be ready in case whoever it was tried to enter.
“Hey, my friend,” Martinez shouted from the other side.
He heard the doorknob turn but it was locked. Justina rose in her bunk. Will went to the door and put his hand on the knob, ready to stop it from opening.
“Will,” Martinez said, “Let me in. I need to talk to you. Why your door is locked? You making love to your hand or what?”
“I’m sleeping, man,” Will shouted, turning away from the door in order to hide how near he was, “Can’t it wait until tomorrow? What do you need?”
“This only take a minute, my friend. I need your help with the DVD player. Then you can go back to playing with your meat.”
Will shouted, “Go on, Martinez. I’m sleeping Goddamnit. Just go on!”
Will pressed his ear softly to the door and waited. At last he heard Martinez mutter something under his breath and walk off. It took minutes for Will to calm down and return to his bunk. He squinted in the direction of Justina’s bunk, where he knew she must be awake, although neither one could see the other.














October 28
It was a clear, mild morning when the Etowah finally got word to depart. At seven in the morning the international dispatcher radioed the sideband – its alarm rang so loud throughout the boat it woke everyone. As soon as Will became conscious enough to understand what had awoken him, he knew they would be leaving soon. Justina woke too and reassured her that nothing was out of the ordinary. Will knew there was still time to admit to the crew he had brought her aboard. Most likely they would not say anything to the company. She would leave and things would return to normal for the trip. She could find another way. It wasn’t the end of the world, after all.
Will came on watch early that day, about nine-thirty. He found nobody in the galley, but on a plate next to the microwave were leftovers from breakfast, hardened biscuits and some dried-up sausage patties. He took a sausage and ate it cold. He listened upstairs to the faint voices coming from the wheelhouse. Will’s mood was strange, disconnected from his surroundings. He went outside to the back deck. He walked to the stern much like he had the previous night. He leaned against the bulwarks and felt the dew soak his shirt. He could see his breath and attempted a doughnut, but it came out nebulous and vanished into the air.
In the distance he watched some workers on the dock. A splash in the river nearby caught his attention and he saw a small beaver paddling along. Then out of the corner of his eye he saw a hand waving to him.
“Big Willy D,” Nathan said, “Did you hear the news?”
“We leaving?”
“Yep.”
“The sideband woke me up. I figured that must be what it was about.”
Nathan nodded, “Drew and Jesse are up the wheelhouse doing the logs. Then we headed out.”
“Great,” Will said.
“You don’t seem to excited.”
“No, I am. You know. I just woke up.”
“You are up early. I don’t think I’ve ever seen your face before eleven.”
“Is Frank up?” Will asked, “Did he get up for the call?”
“I never saw him. To be honest, Will, I don’t think he cares one way or the other. I went and knocked on his door, but he only grumbled and said okay. Didn’t come out.”
“He shouldn’t be here then,” Will said.
“I know it.”
They walked together up the deck. As they went, Will wiped condensation from the headache rack – a large pipe railing that ran up both sides of the deck, used both as a guard for deck cargo and to hang lines on. It was so named because it was easy to bang your head against it as you worked.
Nathan said, “Drew drove me and him to Wal-Mart this morning, after we got the news. Was gonna knock on your door to see if you wanted anything, but then I remembered you had said the other day you had all you needed.”
“That’s cool,” Will said, “I guess I have enough deodorant to make it to Trinidad and back again.”
Nathan laughed.
“I hope so. If not, we might have to make you walk the plank,” Nathan stopped. Will stopped too, “Oh, that reminds me. Man, I called my wife just now. She’s upset about pirates. Can you believe that? Been hearing about them pirates in Nigeria on the news. Now she thinks we gonna get boarded over there.”
“There’s no pirates in the Caribbean,” Will said, “At least, I hope not.”
“That’s what I told her. You know how women get.”
“She’s just worried about you,” Will said, “You’re lucky. I don’t have any woman to worry about me.”
They continued to the galley door and Nathan took the garden hose and sprayed the mud off his boots.
“Look, I’m about to crank them mains. Are you up? Want to help me secure the deck once we head out?”
“Sure,” Will said, “I mean, that’s what I got up for. I wanted to be up when we left.”
“Get one last look at civilization, huh?”
“Yeah.”
Nathan went inside. Will continued to walk the deck. He came around to the port containment bin. It now had a fresh coat of black paint. The discharge bells were freshly painted as well, each one color-coded to indicate its purpose: yellow for fuel, brown for liquid mud, orange for lube oil, and green for drill water. Will had intended to put on a second coat today. With only the one coat rust would eat through by the time they reached Port Lisas. No doubt about that.
Will startled as the port main engine fired up when he stood next to the stack, a cloud of black smoke rose from the exhaust and he breathed in that familiar diesel smell. Not wanting to breathe in too much smoke, he walked towards the piece of machinery in the middle of the deck. It was a mess of pipes and wires. Will wondered what on earth it was for. It looked like something out of a science-fiction movie.
“William,” Drew’s voice came over the loud hailer, “What you doing up early on this fine morning?”
Will glanced to the wheelhouse and saw Drew there. He shrugged his shoulders.
“You heard?”
He gave a thumbs up.
“Want to get off the boat?”
He shook his head no.
“Good, cause that ship done sailed.”
He gave him the finger.
“Son,” Drew said, “Don’t be disrespecting your superior officer. Now look, since you up and all, when Nathan comes out of the engine room, you and him secure that deck and be sure that equipment is chained down good. You know how them dock workers be, not doing that shit right. It probably ain’t going nowhere, but we don’t know what them seas is going to be like.”
Will gave another thumbs up and walked back into the galley.
The other week he had found a box of unsweetened Hershey’s cocoa in the pantry. On the back was a recipe for hot cocoa. Will made it according to the recipe, but added a bit more vanilla extract, and put in a pinch of cinnamon and of course a marshmallow on top. He sat at the galley table with the mug of hot chocolate, plus a sausage biscuit with spicy mustard he heated in the microwave. He was chilled from being outside and the first bite from the sausage biscuit warmed him instantly. He followed it with a swig of the cocoa. It went down warm and smooth. Now he was ready to go to work.
Nathan emerged from the engine room while he was eating. He saw the hot chocolate and made a cup for himself. Then Drew came down and made himself a cup too.
“Why you guys copying me?” Will asked.
“Cause you one way,” Drew shot back, “Only think of yourself. Didn’t think about your poor daddy up there in that cold wheelhouse, did you?”
“You wouldn’t have wanted any if I asked.”
“You probably right,” Drew said. He pulled the mug of hot water from the microwave, and it sloshed onto his wrist. He jumped back and nearly dropped the mug onto the deck.
“Goddamn, that’s some hot water, boy I tell you what!”
#
It was after lunch when the Etowah finally pushed away from the dock. Will and Nathan leaned against the starboard headache rack and waited for Drew’s word to throw off the lines. They heard the bow thruster fire up. Soon Drew’s voice came over the loud hailer,
“Cast off.”
Will went up the steps to the bow and loosened the bow line. Nathan jumped off onto the dock and pushed the gangway onto the boat, then walked to the forward bit and threw off the eye.
“All right, Will,” Nathan shouted.
Will hauled up the line through the chaulk. By the time he had finished, Nathan was already at the midship bit, leaning onto the bulwarks to loosen the line. Will reached him in time haul in the midship line, then walked back to the stern. By this time the Etowah was pulling away from the dock, bow first. At the stern, Will quickly loosened the line to give slack. Nathan whipped off the eye and jumped back onto the boat as Will hauled in the last line. Nathan gave Drew two thumbs up.
“I’ll secure the lines down here,” Will said.
“All right,” Nathan said, “I got the lockers then.”
“Oh,” Will added, “Drew wants us to make sure that equipment is bound down tight.”
“He told me already,” Nathan said, “I guess we can do that last.”
Will faked the yellow and black mooring lines over the headache rack. He moved fast, assuredly. At the end he wrapped the eye of the line twice around the rack. Taking the small tie-off line, he whipped it around the mooring line and pulled it as tight as he could, binding the line tight to the headache rack. Then he tied a slip-knot and tied another knot on top of that. This process secured the mooring lines to the headache rack so they would not be washed overboard at sea, a potentially dangerous scenario since if the lines got caught in the propellers, the boat would be adrift with no method of propulsion.
He repeated this process for the six mooring lines still loose on the deck. By the time he finished Nathan had secured the deck lockers and dogged down the engine room hatch on the starboard side.
“Let’s go ahead and tighten down the equipment,” Nathan suggested, “then we can secure the upper levels.”
“Okay,” Will said.
He walked to the chain which ran over top of the equipment and shook it back and forth. There was significant play in the chain.
“I’ll grab another binder and the cheater pipe,” Will said, walking off in the direction of the deck locker. He had to reopen it since Nathan had already dogged the hatch.
He returned and they both worked together to fasten another chain binder onto the chain. The cheater pipe was a long, hollow metal rod, placed on the handle of the binder to give more leverage. It took both of them pulling on the cheater pipe to fasten the binder. When it was finally down, Will grabbed a spare tie-off line and tied a few knots around the handle, to make sure it wouldn’t come loose in the weather.
“That don’t look like no knot I ever saw,” Nathan observed.
Will answered, “If you don’t know a knot, tie a lot.”
Once they finished securing the upper decks, the Etowah was in the channel and approaching the jetties. Already the boat was being trailed by a multitude of hungry seagulls, looking for food kicked up by the wheel wash.
Nathan wanted to feed the birds some old bread they kept for that purpose. He and Will walked into the galley and grabbed the bread. Will prepared another cup of hot chocolate. Nathan poured himself a cup of coffee, with liberal amounts of sugar and vanilla creamer. They walked to the stern where even more seagulls had since gathered. There were perhaps hundreds of them now, soaring behind the boat, sporadically diving into the wake.
“The only boat photo I have in my house is of a flock of seagulls behind the boat just like this,” Nathan said, “My wife had it framed for my birthday last year. It’s black and white. The perfect shot.”
Will opened the plastic bag and grabbed a handful of old bread. He handed the bag to Nathan and he did the same, setting the bag on the deck boards. They took turns throwing chunks of it into the wake, watching the birds fight over it. Neither one of them spoke. The only sounds out there were the consistent, loud humming of the engines, the washing of the water kicked up by the propellers, and the intermittent shrieking of the birds.
Over time the flock dispersed and the two could clearly see the port growing smaller in the distance. It was now just above the horizon line, a gray mass of indistinguishable shapes. Nathan noticed the sea-buoy off to the port side, about fifty yards from the boat, and pointed it out to Will. There were a few seagulls perched atop its rusty red and white structure. When the buoy bobbed out of the water you could see the barnacles underneath, and sometimes even the large chair which anchored it in place.
Their mugs now empty, and with no more birds left to feed, Will and Nathan decided to head indoors. Nathan picked up the plastic bread bag lying on the deck and kicked some of the larger crumbs through the freeing ports. Will yawned and stretched his back. They both leaned against the stern bulwarks and hesitated a few moments more.




















UNDERWAY

  






October 30
Three days into her voyage across the Gulf of Mexico and so far the Etowah had enjoyed fair weather: clear skies, a visibility that held steady at ten knots, and peaceful seas no more than two or three feet. These favorable conditions had put them well ahead of schedule, and although there were no strict borders out this far, today the Etowah would pass into Mexico. Their plotted course was taking them around the circumference of the Gulf instead of a more direct course through the middle. This was done to sidestep Coast Guard regulations. If a boat sailed through the middle of the Gulf it would need to be outfitted as an ocean-going vessel, which meant for the company more equipment, more crew, and ultimately more money. Under the table, however, it was suggested that once they were out there it would not hurt to steer a more direct course.
Captain Frank had not yet emerged from his room. The only one to see him at all had been Drew who, before they left out, needed him to sign some paperwork to fax to the home office. The situation with the captain had been the primary topic of discussion since departure. Every now and then Will would go down and knock on his door, usually whenever a meal was prepared, but there was never any response. The crew wondered most of all what he was eating in there, since no one had seen him in the galley. The only evidence he was even still alive came from the sound of his guitar, which could be heard at random hours from down the hall. Martinez joked, “Maybe he’s putting on a concert only for himself.” In fact they laughed a lot about it, yet behind the laughter was a real concern. At one point they even got into a half-serious discussion about mutiny and wondered if this could be considered a just cause for it, but after some debate they all agreed they had the opposite problem.
Drew was the most affected by Frank’s absence since there was no relief for him. By law there is required to be a deck officer in the wheelhouse at all times. The others told him he could go to his bunk for a few hours and they would hold down the fort, but Drew felt the responsibility of the trip on his shoulders and refused. Instead he got small fragments of sleep by transforming the wheelhouse into a makeshift bunk. He brought up a pillow and a couple of blankets. “It ain’t good sleep by no stretch,” he said, “but I’ll take it.”
Just as Will had anticipated, once the Etowah left dockside things on the boat quieted down significantly. Jesse and Martinez vanished for the most part, since there was not much work for them to do while underway except make engine room checks, and this was delegated to the hand on watch. Will had only seen Jesse once in the last three days and made the remark that he stayed in his room almost as much as Frank did. Martinez showed his face from time to time, not from necessity, but to bullshit with the others. He spent a lot of time in the lounge watching action movies with the volume turned up way too loud. As a consequence of the general inactivity onboard, Will was not as nervous now as he had been before departure. There seemed little chance now that someone would try to come into his room, and no one had so far.
It felt good to come off watch and find Justina there waiting for him. He even looked forward to it. She too had grown more comfortable with the arrangement and performed her own duties like cleaning up the small space, making the beds, and even decorating the walls – as a joke she had found some tape and put up a few picaresque images from a National Geographic, but Will thought it made the room more homelike and left them up.
#
Beams of afternoon sunlight fell through the cabin windows and illuminated dust particles in the air, making it degrees warmer in the wheelhouse than anywhere else on the boat. For this reason Will had propped open both doors in order to create a draft. He listened now to the soothing rust of water being cut through by the Etowah’s bow while he just gazed at the horizon. Both his feet were propped on the old-fashioned boat wheel. The wheel was still functional yet unused, ever since a more modern steering system had been installed, controlled by a stick on the left arm of the chair. Snores came at random from Drew asleep at the other end of the wheelhouse.
The Etowah was on autopilot and it was Will’s responsibility to keep lookout for other vessels whose course might intersect with theirs. This was a fairly common occurrence in more populated waters, but out here they had only seen a handful. At the moment, however, he was keeping an eye on a small boat crossing the bow. The radar put it at nine miles. It appeared to be some kind of yacht, but it was hard to tell at this distance even with binoculars.
“Drew,” Will yelled over his shoulder, “Wake up. We at the waypoint.”
Drew rolled over, only half-asleep really, and rubbed his face with both hands, “You better not be lying to me, Willy D.”
“We got two more miles.”
“I knew it,” Drew said, “Wake me up when we at zero point two. Roger?”
“Roger.”
Fifteen minutes later Drew was at the helm, entering new waypoint coordinates into the GPS. Will was on break downstairs. He had hidden some of Justina’s clothes and undergarments in with his load and took them out of the dryer. The last thing he wanted was a crew member to stumble upon a pair of panties in the dryer along with his clothes, so he put them into his laundry box without folding and took them to his room. Justina opened the door halfway and Will handed her the box without another word. She took the box and closed the door.
When he returned to the wheelhouse, Will brought sodas for Drew and himself. He sat down in the lookout chair and watched the undulations of the deep blue waters which surrounded them as far as the eye could see. The yacht Will had been monitoring was gone. It was half an hour before Will shook himself from the hypnotic effect of the landscape.
“There’s no oil platforms or satellites or any sign of civilization out here,” Will observed, “just the water and the sky and us. Might as well be sailing a thousand years ago.”
“Sailors back then had it rough,” Drew said. He seemed himself to have emerged from a daydream, “We got it made now. Air-conditioning, refrigeration, toilets for Pete’s sake. We live in luxury compared to how those sailors had it back then. We should be grateful, but instead we just complain.”
“I don’t think I would have made it back then,” Will said.
“I agree.”
“You wouldn’t have made it either, you goddamn Cajun.”
“That’s very possible,” Drew agreed, then he held up a finger as if he had an idea, “Oh shit, I got a task for you. Damn, I must be slipping.”
“What?”
“We supposed to be flying the flag, especially now we out here. Why don’t you hop on that real quick? And when you’re done with that, come on back. I got another task.”
“Roger roger,” Will said, rising from the chair.
He went to the chart table and slid open the long drawer. Then he pulled the triangle-folded flag out of its case and went outside to the rear of the wheelhouse deck, where four halyards were secured to the guard rail. He loosened one of them and took it by one hand. Then he unfolded the flag and draped it over his back so it wouldn’t hit the deck. Next he attached the flag at two ends to the hooks on the halyard. Once attached, he hoisted the flag until it reached the mast’s cross-bar, about fifty feet up. Finally he secured the line to the guard rail with a clove hitch. The raised flag whipped violently in the wind. Will observed it for a few moments then returned to the wheelhouse.
Drew stood at the opposite door with a cigarette in hand, watching.
“Professional job, Wilber,” Drew said, “didn’t let the colors touch the deck or nothing. Now you ready for the second task of the day?”
“Sure thing,” Will said, “you want me to run through some SIPs?”
“Fuck no. I got a very simple question for you, young-un.”
“What’s that?”
“What we gonna eat?”
“I don’t know,” Will admitted, “Good question.”
“That’s your task. We gonna come up with a fine menu and then you gonna cook it, and then we gonna have us a feast to celebrate this milestone of our voyage.”
“We need to get Martinez in on this,” Will said, “When I went down he was just sitting in the lounge watching a movie, not doing shit. He can contribute too. He’s a better cook than me anyway. Maybe we can prepare some Mexican cuisine.”
“That would be appropriate,” Drew said, “Yes indeed.” He picked up the phone, flipped the knob to the lounge, and turned the ringer a few times. After a few seconds Will heard Martinez’s muffled voice say hello.
“My friend,” Drew yelled into the phone, “Come see. We got important business to discuss.”
In a few minutes Martinez ambled up the steps, yawning.
“Hey Drew, why you have to bother me? I hard-working man today. Will know. Ask Will.”
“That’s true,” Will said, “I never saw somebody work so hard at not doing shit.”
Martinez laughed.
The three of them debated for some time about what to prepare. All three wanted something different. Will suggested making spaghetti and meatballs from scratch, as that was all he could prepare with confidence. Drew was fine with that, but Martinez didn’t want pasta, so Drew suggested grilling some steak and vegetables. Will thought they needed a more exotic dish and reminded Drew of the idea to prepare something Mexican. Finally they decided on two things. Martinez would prepare steak burritos on the grill, and Will would bake a pineapple upside-down cake for dessert.
#
Downstairs Martinez wrote down a list of all the ingredients he needed from the walk-in: green onions, yellow onions, tomatoes, bell peppers, mushrooms, two packs of rib-eye steaks, one pack of flour tortillas, and sour cream. While Will gathered the ingredients Martinez went outside and fired up the grill.
Soon the meat was cut and placed on the grill, and Will had washed everything Martinez requested, plus some cheddar cheese which Martinez never used but Will considered a necessary ingredient. He now mixed the batter for the pineapple upside-down cake. He used a metal whisk. Then he wiped the pan with vegetable oil and arranged the pineapple slices along the bottom. In the center of each slice he placed a cherry. Finally he poured the batter over the pineapples. The oven was heated to three-hundred and fifty degrees. Will opened the door and slid in the pan. He wrote the time on the whiteboard next to the clock.
Done with that, he remembered Martinez had asked that he cut up the vegetables to roast on the grill, so he pulled the wooden cutting board and knife from the drawer. He was no good at this task but hoped it would be acceptable. He sprinkled some salt and pepper over the vegetables and arranged them on a plate. Then he joined Martinez on deck.
The lid of the rusty old grill was shut and smoke billowed out from the sides and bottom. Will heard the meat sizzling within. Will set down the plate and stood over to the side.
“Thank you, my friend,” Martinez said. He opened the lid of the grill and checked the strips of steak. They were nearly done, so he placed the vegetables onto the upper rack.
“My friend,” Martinez frowned, “Why you cut the onions with a grinder?”
“I used a knife. I can’t ever cut those damn things straight.”
“It’s not hard,” Martinez said, “I show you some time.”
When the meat and vegetables were cooked, Martinez plated them and both he and Will returned to the galley to prepare the burritos. Each one rolled up so thick it tore at the sides. Will sprinkled grated cheese on his burrito and watched it melt over the steak. Altogether they prepared six burritos, one for every member of the crew. Martinez made a plate for Drew. They pulled out some cold drinks and ascended to the wheelhouse.
They ate well. Drew told Martinez it was probably the best burrito he ever ate his life. This led to a discussion about how many burritos the average person had eaten in a lifetime. Martinez said for him the number was too high to count. Will actually tried to figure an approximate number. He got out the calculator and came up with a couple hundred, give or take. Drew said it would probably be in the thousands for him. “If you really saw the number,” Will said, “It would probably seem small.”
Eventually the conversation dried up and each man sat there quietly gazing at the calm seas ahead, their eyelids heavy with sleepiness. Drew drifted off at some point then came to with a sudden jolt and slapped himself awake. This roused Will too. He rose and stood next to the helm.
“Want me to take it for awhile?”
“Sit down, young un,” Drew said, rubbing his eyes, “It’s all good.”
Drew yawned and reached his arms high over head. This made Will yawn. He glanced over and saw Martinez asleep at the rear console, his hood pulled over his head.
“Look at that lazy fucker there,” Will said.
“Siesta time, hombre.”
Will seemed anxious. He paced around the house, first to the chart table, then to the doors. He went outside and walked around the wheelhouse deck, inspecting the flag lines and then came back and sat in the lookout chair. Drew gave him a funny look.
“Can’t you sit still for one minute?” Drew asked.
“Well,” Will said, “I feel like I ought to be doing something. Not used to just sitting here. You officers might start thinking I’m lazy or some shit.”
“You ain’t doing nothing. You supposed to be my lookout. That’s an important job on a vessel. Even though there ain’t shit out here, it’s still your responsibility. Besides, I know you ain’t lazy. If you was lazy I would know. I can always tell a lazy man.”
Will was curious, “How’s that?”
“Well,” Drew said, in thought, “Take this morning when I asked you to raise that flag, took you what, a few minutes. Now a lazy man, a talented lazy man anyway, he would have stretched that simple task to half an hour. Maybe longer. See, a lazy man ain’t stupid. In fact, he goes to a lot of effort not to get anything accomplished. It’s a weird thing, man. I seen it with my own eyes. You stay out here long enough and you see some strange behavior.”
“So I ain’t lazy?” Will asked.
“You ain’t lazy,” Drew replied, “You kind of a fuckup, but you ain’t lazy.”
“How about Martinez?”
“He ain’t lazy either. Jesse’s lazy as hell. Frank’s lazy. Nathan can be lazy if you let him, but I know how to motivate my peons.”
“How you do that?”
“Depends on the situation,” Drew said. He was quiet for a moment, then said, “Did I ever tell you about the time I worked on the Pecos, when they was on dry dock?”
“No, I don’t believe so.”
“Renee gave me some extra work, back when I was saving up for that vacation I took last year. He sent me to the Pecos River. They was on dry dock down there close to Intercoastal. So I drive down, relieve the mate on board. Mate laughs as he’s tossing his bags onto the dock. Good luck, he says. What you mean? I say. He says there’s a crew of lazy hands on board, won’t do shit. Captain is fucking furious, just about to call the office on them boys. So I say well let me see about that. First thing I did was find the captain. He said, these goddamn hands they sent me is worthless niggers. Niggers, I say? Well, they ain’t black, but they niggers just the same. All they do is sit around and bullshit. Got rust on this boat from bow to stern and all they do is eat, shit, and sleep. So when I heard that, I knew just what to do. Something I learned in the Navy back in the day. I told that captain, give me just one week with them hands. After one week, if you don’t have the best goddamn working hands you ever seen you can send me packing. Well, that captain looked like he thought I was full of shit. But then he shook my hand and said, deal.”
Drew got a look in his eye like a sly grin. You could tell he was proud of himself, his foot tapping against the rest. Will smiled, curious.
“First thing in the morning I gathered all them hands together and laid it down. You guys got one week until your ass is gone, fired, you savvy? Naw man, they all said. We ain’t did nothing. That’s the problem, I said. Ain’t nobody told us what to do, another one said. Well, I’m here to tell you what you’re gonna do. Absolutely nothing. Don’t want you guys to lift one finger this whole week. Not deck work, not sanitary, nothing. When you come on watch I want you to sit your ass down at that galley table and wait until the next man comes on watch.”
“You actually did that?” Will asked, “you made them do nothing at all?”
“They didn’t believe I was serious at first. I told the first guy come on watch, sit down in that galley and watch me do your sanitary. He laughed and sat down with a stupid grin. Pull a magazine from his pocket. No sir, I said. You ain’t gonna be looking at no magazines or books. That would be something. Boy that grin disappeared pretty quick, let me tell you what. By the end of the first day, all them boys was crying. Man, let us do something, they said. Let us go to work. We can’t take it anymore. I said, you had all the chance in the world to do something and you let it pass you by. Now you got your wish, for six more days.”
“That’s cold, man. That’s torture.”
“You ain’t alone. After three days the captain came up to me and said, them boys done learned they lesson, let em go back to work. Captain, I said, we had a deal, and they crying now, but if we go back on our word, they going back to the way they was before. You got to trust me. Captain said okay. Three more days go by. Them boys was broke by then, broke like you break a horse. I gathered them all together at the end and asked them, you had a whole week of doing nothing, what you gonna do tomorrow? Work they all say. Don’t make us sit there anymore. That’s like prison. You can’t do that to a man. We want to work. Give us a chance to prove it.”
“Did they work after that?”
“What you think? Never had one lick of trouble out those hands since. They all standup guys. One of them worked on here before. Sergei, you remember him?”
“Oh yeah,” Will said, “he was a good guy.”
“He was after I got through with him,” Drew said, “So after all that, the captain comes up to me, shakes me hand. He says I ain’t never seen nothing like it. Beats all I ever seen. Can’t hardly get them to take a break anymore they working so hard. You’re welcome, I say. Thank you, he says.”
Drew gave the helm to Will and went down to take a piss. Meanwhile Martinez awoke from his nap and joined will at the helm. Will told him the story he missed, but Martinez just scoffed,
“Will,” Martinez said, “why you believe everything people tells you? I hear that same story from every mate I work with. That shit ain’t for real. Think about it. They would just have fired them guys.”
Will pondered that. Soon Drew returned and Will asked him if the story were true. Drew would neither confirm nor deny it, but a smile grew on his face as he took the helm.
“Go do your sanitary,” Drew said as he pounded a cigarette from the pack, “Here, take this plate with you when you go.”
Will did as he was told, and over the next half hour Martinez and Drew watched as the sun dropped below the horizon, casting colorful shadows over the face of the waters.
#
Justina sat on the edge of the bunk eating a burrito. Her legs did not reach the deck and so swung gently with the motion of the vessel. Her hair, still wet from the shower, was pulled into a long ponytail and draped over one shoulder. All three bunks were neatly made. His dirty work clothes were tucked away out of sight and all the stray magazines were placed back into the lockers. The florescent lights were turned off, but she had turned on each bunk light which gave the room a soft, dim ambience. Because the false wood paneling provided no real insulation from the iron hull, you could clearly hear the waves as they crashed up against it, endlessly. In rough weather this got to be a real pain, because not only did you hear the waves, but sleeping in your rack, you thoroughly felt the reverberation at each crash. But at times when the seas were mild, the crashing and reverberation instead produced a hypnotic, meditative effect not unlike the ebb and flow of waves at the beach. Justina finished off the last bite of burrito and sat patiently waiting for Will to return.
Soon the recognizable knock came at the door and she opened it for him. Will entered and relocked the door. He saw she was done with the food and set the plate inside the locker. Then they both sat on the empty bunk at the same time, a place which had come to serve as a living room for the both of them, a common place to visit. It was not the most comfortable place to sit upright for very long, however, so usually they ended up leaned back against the wooden panels. They did this now, both facing the grimy overhead with their hands behind their heads, as if star-gazing.
“Did your captain come out of the room today?”
“No.”
“What took you so long?”
“Martinez needed help with the DVD player.”
“Your Mexican friend.”
“Yeah,” Will said, “I don’t know why he has such a hard time with that thing. But he does.”
“Next time you see him, tell him Quien es tu papi, perra.”
“Why? What does it mean?”
“Just tell him,” she replied, “It’s just an old Mexican greeting.”
“He’s going to kick my ass right?”
“Just do it.”
“What is it again?”
“Quein es tu papi, perra?”
“Quein es tu papi, perra,” Will repeated.
“Right,” she laughed.
“I thought they spoke English in Trinidad.”
“They do.”
“Then how you know Spanish? Did you learn it in school?”
“My father is from Mexico. He would only talk to me in Spanish, so I picked it up over the years.”
“What about your mother?”
“What about her?”
“Is she from Mexico too?”
“No. Trinidad.”
“So you’re a mutt.”
“Yes.”
“That’s cool,” Will said, “How did they meet?”
“My father came to Trinidad for work a long, long time ago. There was work in the oil and gas industry. He met my mother while she was still in school. He asked her out on a date and she said only if he brought her a present of her favorite cookie. But she would not tell him what that was. So every day after that he followed her home with a different kind of cookie until one day he found the right one, macadamia nut. Only then would she agree to go out with him,” Justina sighed, “So romantic.”
“Are they still together?”
“No, my mother passed away when I was small,” Justina said. A silence followed, after which she added, “Please don’t ask me any questions about her. I don’t want to talk about that.”
Justina rose and went to her bunk. She pulled out the hair brush from her purse, sat down again, and neither one of them said anything. She brushed her hair and Will stared at the overhead in silence. Finally he said, “Do you remember our agreement?”
Justina faced him.
“Yes.”
“Well?”
“Well what?” she asked, “You were going to tell me the story of how you came to this boat, then I was going to tell you how I came to the United States.”
“Not how, why,” he said, “It doesn’t matter how.”
“It doesn’t matter why.”
“It does to me. I’m curious.”
“Let’s hear it then. I bet it is an exciting story.”
Will began with a sigh, “Not really. There’s not a lot to it. Captain Frank is the reason I work on this boat.”
“The same captain who won’t come out of his room.”
“Right,” Will acknowledged, “Frank and I have always worked well together. Everybody likes to call me his pet or his bitch or whatever, but it’s not like that. He just took a liking to me from the beginning. I think it was that we could talk about real shit. Not just bullshit, but real conversation. The very first time I worked with him I was still a green hand.”
“Green hand? What does that mean? I don’t understand what you said.”
“I was a green hand. Green. Like new, inexperienced. Hand like a worker. Green hand.”
“Yeah,” she nodded, “Okay.”
“Of course I thought I had it all figured out by that point. Could splice an eye and tie a bowline, what else was there, I thought. What an asshole. The crew change coordinator sent me to the Miami River to relieve the regular AB. Frank was the relief captain on that boat. I took a helicopter out to the rig where the boat was tied. Once on board I go up and meet Frank at the stern controls. He introduces himself and asked me how long I’ve been working offshore. You always get questions like that when you go to a new boat, a period of time where the crew feels you out, sees if you’re worth a damn. I told him I’d only been working out there a few months. He was like, man you’re still green. I’ve washed more salt water from my dick than you’ve sailed on.”
Justina laughed.
“You like that one?” Will asked, “That’s a pretty good one. Well, he says to me, I’ve got a job for you, if you’re ready to go to work. Yes sir. Good, he says, I like that initiative. We need to calibrate the radars. There was a squall a few days ago and it fouled up the equipment. He handed me a bag. Put this suit on and walk out there to the stern. You know where the stern is right? Of course, I say. Get way back so the radars can pick you up. Then await my instructions. I’ll be up here and let you know what to do on the loudhailer. So I open the bag and inside is a white painter’s suit. I crawl into that. The other piece of equipment is a hat. Now this hat looks like a dunce cap, like a big cone on your head, and it’s covered in aluminum foil. I ask Frank why it looks that way. He says because the radar picks up metal frequencies and the point on top makes it a stronger signal. That sounds reasonable to me with the little knowledge I have of how a radar works. And he looks very serious. So I put on the hat and there were also two long batons with aluminum foil balls on the end, so I had to carry those as well. I walk outside, go to the stern, and already the roustabouts on the rig are looking down at me like I’m insane. Frank calls over the loud hailer for me to raise the batons over my head. So I do. Then raise them to my side. So I do. This goes on for five minutes. He had me in all kinds of goofy poses. By this time a whole gang of rig workers had gathered and were pointing at me, laughing. Soon, I look up and the entire crew of the Miami is there in the wheelhouse, taking pictures, all red in the face laughing. So I felt like an idiot. And I knew all along, but you know when you’re new, how do you know for sure? You just have to go along with it. And I never lost my temper. Frank told me later that’s how he knew I would be a good guy to work with. But I knew that someday I’d be a part of some crew giving the green guy a hard time, so I bit my tongue. That was my only hitch on the Miami. But a year or so later, when Frank got his own boat, the Etowah, Renee calls up and says Captain Frank requested me to come work for him. So I did, and I been here ever since.”
Justina smiled.
“Your captain seems like a good man.”
“He’s good people,” Will said.
“Are you happy here, on this boat?”
“There’s no other boat I’d rather be on.”
“Good,” Justina said, “that’s good.”
She yawned and stretched her arms. Will yawned too.
“You know,” she said, “I think I might want some of that cake you made. Can you bring me a piece with some milk?”
“Yes ma’am, I can. But you probably won’t like it. Drew said it was dry.”
“I don’t care.”
“Okay,” Will said. He approached the door, “In fact I might have a piece myself.”
“I thought it was dry.”
“I guess I don’t care either.”
They exchanged smiles.
A few minutes later Will returned with two small plates of cake and two glasses of milk. She opened the door for him. Her eyes were reddened and her cheeks wet. She took the plate and milk from him and sat on the bunk. She took a bite of the cake with just her fingers, then licked them clean.
“I brought you a fork to eat it with.”
“I don’t need no fork.”
“Justina, why are you crying?” Will asked. He had not yet begun to eat his cake, “What happened?”
She sobbed, “I am not a good person. Everyone else is good except for me. Everyone deserves happiness except for me. I’m a piece of shit. I’m even worse than shit. If I died tomorrow no one would remember me.”
“Why are you saying these things?”
She set down the cake and placed her head in her hands. Will sat down beside her and put his arm around her. She sobbed against his shoulder as he tried to understand what had brought this on all of a sudden. He didn’t know what to say.
“Justina,” he asked, “Why did you come to the US?”
She answered as if it were the most obvious thing in the world.
“For love.”












November 4
Underneath the galley table, just out of sight, Will spotted the second old penny he had found that day. He swept it towards him and picked it up out of a small pile of dust and old crumbs. Absently he rubbed the penny between his thumb and forefinger. The first one he had found behind the pantry door, purely by accident. If he hadn’t found that one he never would have thought to look for the one he just found. Finally he placed the penny heads-up on the galley table and went upstairs.
As he entered the wheelhouse, Will saw no one was at the helm, yet from the constant back and forth motion of the rudder indicator above the compass, he knew it was on autopilot. Outside he saw the day was still overcast. There was a slight chop to the seas, just enough of a chop to throw off your balance if you weren’t paying attention. It was cold up here compared to the rest of the boat. Poor insulation had always plagued the Etowah’s cabin during the cold season.
Drew stood over the chart table, his reading glasses set down on his nose, filling in the daily log. A moment later he shut the book, placed it back in the corner with the other logs, and returned to the helm. Not once did he acknowledge Will’s presence in the room.
“Drew.”
“Will,” Drew replied. He glanced at the compass heading and double-checked the coordinates on the GPS. Once satisfied he pulled out a cigarette and walked to the side door to smoke.
“Why you left pennies all over for me to find like some green hand? I know how to do a sanitary.”
Drew took his time responding.
“Before we discuss that can I ask why you didn’t spray off them windows when you came on watch today?”
“Martinez needed help after lunch. I figured it wouldn’t matter if I did it later.”
“Wouldn’t matter?” Drew asked, “What’s the first thing at the top of the boat rules list that’s posted all over the boat? Hands make sure the cabin windows are always spotless, followed by three exclamation marks. You know at the start of every watch you need to come up here and make sure they clean. But it’s okay now, I did it myself. Just keep that shit in mind.”
“All right.”
“Now, to address your other concern, why I left pennies in the galley. That’s because your sanitary done turned to shit ever since we left Cameron. Listen, I know we act up on this boat and have a good time, but it’s still a place of work and standards need to be maintained. You don’t have no good excuse for the mess that galley’s been in. Not one excuse. Hell, you ain’t doing no deck work while we underway. So what the fuck you been doing then? The other day I went through and found dirt in all the corners, rotten vegetables in the walk-in, and the head was a damn disgusting mess. So like any good deck officer I hid some pennies around to make sure you did your work, just like I would a green hand. I mean if you gonna act like one then that’s how you’re gonna be treated. That’s all they is to it. You only found the one?”
“Two.”
“Well, I guess you have more work to do then,” Drew said, “Will, I ain’t trying to be a hard-ass. I just want you to do your job. That ain’t too much to ask, I don’t believe.”
“No. I know. But I thought I needed to help Martinez down there first.”

You ain’t paid to think. You paid to do your job.”
Will returned to the galley without another word. There, over the next few hours, he swept, scrubbed, and cleaned until everything below the 01 deck was clean enough for crew change. It was a real mess. He scrubbed the entire deck twice over to get all the grease spots tracked in from the engine room. He scraped dried cheese from the glass plate inside the microwave and cleaned out each stove eye.
Martinez came down from the lounge and watched Will scrubbing the deck behind the refrigerator. Will did not see him. It was a few moments before he spoke.
“My friend,” he said, “Why you mad at the floor?”
“I ain’t mad. I just got to get it clean. That’s my job, ain’t it? Can’t have a dirty boat.”
Will stopped and set the scrub brush against the counter. He wiped the sweat from his brow and faced Martinez, “It’s your fault.”
“How it’s my fault?” Martinez asked.
“You had me down there helping you when I came on watch. Then Drew gives me a hard time about how I ain’t doing my job.”
“It’s not my fault the galley is not clean,” Martinez said, “You could have told me to wait.”
Will thought about it, “You’re right,” he admitted, “Sorry man. What you doing down here? Thought you was watching a movie.”
“Intermission.”
With this, Martinez walked to the pantry and returned holding a bag of ginger snaps. He pulled a Coke from the fridge and drank it down.
“Quein es tu papi, perra,” Will said.
Martinez looked at him.
“What?”
“Quein es tu papi, perra.”
Martinez laughed, “Will, why you say that to me? It sounds like you don’t know what you talking about.”
“Well, I don’t,” Will admitted.
“Where you hear that from?”
“Read it in a book.”
“You ask me if you are my father. Then you call me a bitch.”
“A bitch?” Will laughed.
“If we not friends I beat your ass.”
“Wait,” Will said, “You mean like who’s your daddy? Like a question?”
“Yeah,” Martinez said, “Who’s your daddy, bitch?”
They laughed. Then Martinez walked halfway up the stairs before shouting down, “My friend, I’ll talk to you later, okay? I have to go back to work now. The movie is not going to watch itself.”
“Get back to work,” Will said.
Next on the list was the walk-in cooler. When he opened the door Will saw what must have been a week’s worth of leftovers in Tupperware containers, all piled together, some overturned. He picked them all up the best he could and carried them outside to the deck. From there he spooned the dry, sticky contents overboard one at a time, starting with the largest, and stacked the empty ones inside the other. The food came out in solid clumps, plopped into the wake, and disappeared.
Walking inside, Will was surprised to see Jesse there leaned up against the hose rack with his headphones on, cigarette in hand. He had the music turned up so loud Will could hear the lyrics of the song from where he stood. Ever since their confrontation he had found it uncomfortable whenever they were alone. It seemed he never knew quite what to say anymore, and their conversation was always forced and too polite. Will figured Jesse must have been watching him the entire time and nodded to him. Jesse pulled the headphones down.
“Feed them fishes,” he said.
“Yep.”
Will walked over to where Jesse stood. He didn’t have anything to say, but thought it would be more awkward to go inside without stopping to say hi.
“Haven’t seen you around much these days,” Will said.
“Been in my room, man. Ain’t shit else for me to do out here. Just take some pills and chill. Got Martinez doing engine room checks during the daytime and Nathan does them at night. Want some?”
“Want what?”
“Pills, man.”
“I guess not,” Will replied, “According to Drew I’m already not doing my job, so I don’t think I’d do any better by taking pills.”
“Ah, fuck him,” Jesse said, “He just gets in them moods where he’s got to play captain. I was just fucking with you anyway. I know you straight as straight can be.”
“Yep.”
“Straight-edge Will.”
Neither had much else to say, so they both stared out towards the stern of the boat and watched the waves splash onto the deck. A steady sheet of water ran off the freeing ports back into the sea. Will watched the water flow over and under the deck boards, around the chained-down equipment.
It was a wet-deck day for sure. It had been dry-deck days ever since they left Cameron five days ago. Those were the days when the seas were mild and the boat was steady, so consequently the deck stayed dry. Work on those days was less stressful. You could get out there and get some work done and it more or less seemed like any normal land job. Then there were the wet-deck days. Those were the days when it was choppy and water stayed on the deck. That added another level of stress on top of everything else, since a wet deck was slick and everything you did seemed that much more dangerous.
“Check it out, bro,” Jesse said. He pointed behind the port stack, “there’s a flock of birds hitching a ride. See, over there.”
Will looked to where Jesse pointed. There between the headache rack and the bulwarks on the port side stood five or six large, white birds. They had long legs and sharp, pointed beaks.
“What are those?” Will asked.
“I got no idea. Look at them motherfuckers.”
“Look at the way they stand together. I wonder how long they’ve been riding.”
“Maybe they on vacation,” Jesse said.
“Be right back,” Will said, “Gonna look them up in that bird guide Frank keeps in the wheelhouse.”
Will ran up the outside steps to the wheelhouse level and entered by the side door. He went to the chart table drawer and pulled out the guide.
“What you need now?” Drew asked.
“There’s some birds on the back deck, hitching a ride. Me and Jesse want to see what they are.”
Drew rose and walked to the stern controls. He picked up the binoculars.
“Where they at?”
“Behind the port stack, over there. Not sure if you can see them from up here.”
“I see a couple. They look like egrets. Look up egrets.”
Will flipped through the book.
“You’re right,” Will said, “The Snowy Egret. Wonder if they’re migrating using our boat. Says here they’re migratory. I’m gonna go down and have a closer look.”
Back on the deck Will and Jesse both approached the stern. They had miscounted. There were seven birds in total. Up close they looked more dangerous. They stood back and watched for a few minutes, but the birds never took any notice of them. Will found it amusing whenever a wave splashed onto the deck and the birds lost their balance and stumbled. He had never seen a bird stumble before.
One of the egrets stood apart from the flock. It looked sick. The others stood upright with tense wings, as if ready to take off at any moment. But the sick one stood hunkered-down and swayed with every motion of the vessel, even more so than the others, as if it had no strength of its own. Its feathers in comparison were dull and grey. After time Will saw why the sick egret stood apart. Every few minutes it would slowly drag itself over to the flock, but then the outermost bird, whichever one it happened to be, would squawk and flap its wings in an intimidating manner. This by itself did not deter the sick egret, but as soon as it was close enough the outermost bird pecked and pushed it away from the flock again. Will watched this happen twice. The outcast bird tumbled over onto its side and did not get up right away. A rush of water swept onto the deck and rolled the bird onto its back. It was nearly dead, a wad of wet feathers.
“Look at that one.”
“It’s diseased or hurt, or something,” Jesse observed, “those others just don’t want what he got.”
“We ought to help him at least. Maybe he’s just hungry.”
“He ain’t just hungry.”
“I’m gonna help him onto his feet at least.”
“Go ahead,” Jesse said, “It’s your eyeballs.”
“You think he’s gonna peck out my eyeballs?”
“Find out if you want to.”
“I ain’t afraid,” Will said, “I ain’t afraid of the sick one anyway.”
“Better you than me.”
With some trepidation Will approached the sick bird. Jesse stood back next to the cargo, cigarette in hand.
“Man, why you had to say something?” Will shouted, “Now I keep thinking it’s gonna peck out my eyes.”
“Well it might.”
Will returned up the deck. Jesse laughed.
“He looks bad the closer you get. I’m gonna grab a towel to throw over him. You wanna give me a hand?”
“Why you wanna do that?” Jesse asked.
Will said, “We could prop open the deck locker and put him in there. Would keep those others from pecking him to death. Could give him some water and food too.”
“All right.”
Will went inside and grabbed a towel from the cabinet. He returned and both he and Jesse once again approached the stern. Will told Jesse to walk around from behind and scare it in his direction, while Will held up the towel ready to throw it over him. But it was soon clear this strategy was unnecessary. As they inched closer it was evident the bird was not going anywhere. It merely fluttered on its back, helpless. Will threw the towel over it and there was no reaction at all. He lifted it in both hands and carried it forward to the deck locker with Jesse following close behind. It felt limp in his hands.
Jesse opened the deck locker and Will placed it gently on the deck. He half-expected the bird to flutter and fly out when he removed the towel, but it did not. It only swayed and looked at him. He fashioned a cubbyhole with the towel around the bird and then went inside. He found an empty gallon water jug and cut off the base, then filled the base with lukewarm water. He took the dish outside along with a bag of old bread.  Jesse was still there. Will set the dish in front of it. He tore a slice of bread into pieces and set them next to the dish. The bird eyed him but still did not move or take any interest.
“He ain’t gonna eat none of that bread,” Jesse said, “You can tell by the beak it eats insects and spiders, shit like that.”
Will argued, “We feed bread to the seagulls. They have sharp beaks. Other than the bread, I don’t know what else to give him.”
“Dude, that bird don’t need food nor water no how. It’ll be dead before morning.”
Jesse lit another cigarette and sat on the chain box, uninterested. He gazed out to the horizon, towards the sunset, which had cast a dull, orange tinge over the sea. He put on his headphones.
Will spent the remainder of his watch going back and forth from the wheelhouse to the deck locker, to check on the sick bird. When the sun went down he flipped on the small light above the galley door. He opened a can of tuna fish and put some in a bowl, but the bird did not even look at it. He talked with Drew about how they could feed it, consulting the bird guide, which was not much help, but at least it confirmed egrets ate only insects and such things.

“Frank’s theory, his main one, is that after World War II the allied forces had a unique opportunity to take over the world. Not like Hitler, but with one nation governing all the major nations, a global nation, led of course by the United States. Be we didn’t do that. Instead, according to Frank, the highest of the high, President Truman and others, made deals with Russia and China to establish what would become known as the Cold War. So the entire history of the Cold War was just an invention of the powers that be. The benefits of the Cold War were that there was no actual destruction, only the threat of it, and that certain industries benefited greatly from weapons and deterrents manufacturing. Somehow the oil industry and automobile manufacturers were also involved. I can’t remember how, but that’s Frank. He has it out for the auto industry. He believes around the same time as the Cold War scheming there were also plans for a mass-transit system in the United States, utilizing trains, one that would rival any modern day train system. But it was squashed from the influence of the oil and gas industry, who instead supported the manufacture of automobiles that consumed their products. I think the hypocrisy of him working as a captain on an oil field supply boat gets to him. That’s probably what makes him so angry all the time. But to get back to my original point, all this I’ve told you he’s written down into a thousand page book that he won’t show anybody. I mean nobody. And I’ve tried my damndest to take a look. I can only imagine the utter insanity contained in those ramblings. Maybe there is some truth to it all, who knows? I just find it hard to swallow that all these world leaders were making secret deals to take control of the world. I just don’t think that sort of thing exists outside the movies, or in the brain of some mad conspiracy theorist. Maybe there is some megalomaniac every now and then, like Hitler or Stalin, but as a general rule no way. There’s no such thing as an evil genius with his finger on the button. There’s only greed. People like you and me looking out for their own immediate interests. The people who run the world, they aren’t special people. They’re just in a position to get whatever they want. And that individual greed and desire just clusters into something like a big, dumb evil force. I think so anyway.”
Justina lay on her side listening to Will. She had spoken very little tonight, queasy from the choppy weather. Will, on the other hand, had yammered for nearly an hour and felt like a bore. But he wanted to talk. As he finished he turned to find Justina half asleep on her arm. The new quiet in the room roused her after a moment.
“Interesting,” she said, yawning.
“You weren’t even listening,” Will said, “I know you were asleep. Don’t pretend.”
“No for real, I was listening,” she laughed, “I listen that way.”
Will cocked an eyebrow, “What was the last thing I said?”
“Something about Frank.”
“Something about Frank,” Will said, “Good to know you got something out of it, at least.”
“What were you saying? Tell me again. He makes me laugh, your captain.”
“Well, he is a bit crazy I guess, but Frank is a good guy. I like him more than most captains I’ve worked with out here. He’s just in a bad place right now. Has been for awhile. He loves his wife but she doesn’t love him back.”
“I see.”
“But he wasn’t always like he is now. What I’m about to tell you might make him come off like an asshole, since he was married at the time, but not to me. See, Frank was infatuated with this Asian cashier at the grocery store where we shopped each week. Down there in Grand Isle. She was pretty, young, maybe around your age. Frank’s in his forties. I don’t know. Maybe it’s not too bad. She seemed to like him too. I remember one night we were underway to the rig and he would just not shut up about her. Felicia was her name. Well, he couldn’t get over how she called him Mr. Frank. He said, Will, Felicia was telling me goodbye and was like, you have a good day now, Mr. Frank. Just as cute as she could be. At that moment I wanted to ask her, do you know what a precious treasure you are? A precious treasure. So I asked Frank why he didn’t take her out sometime, not even thinking he had a wife back home. But this was something different. No way man, he said. I ain’t nowhere near good enough for her. She’s just, pure. What would I do with that? I mean pure man. Will, I swear my old lady’s a fucking bitch. But she’s just what I deserve.”
Justina looked thoughtful and after time said, “I think he deserves her.”
“Do you?”
“So, Will,” she said, ignoring the question, “tell me, who is your girlfriend back home? Does she stay in Georgia with you?”
“I don’t have a girlfriend.”
“Why not?”
“I don’t know,” he said, “I just don’t have one. Girls think I’m boring.”
“You’re not boring. If you stay in Trinidad I will help you find a nice girl, okay?”
Will smiled.
“Why are you laughing at me?”
“Not laughing,” Will said, then changed the subject, “How about your relationship? What happened? I want to hear about it.”
Justina grew quiet and drifted away for a space of time, and then responded in a much different tone than before, “It is like when there is so much hope for a thing, and then the reality is not how you dreamed it would be.”
Her words hung in the air for a long time. Will did not ask anything more. Eventually he rose from the bunk and asked if she wanted anything to eat. Justina rubbed her stomach with a frown. He went to the galley for a bowl of Frosted Flakes. When he returned he handed her a half-eaten pack of saltine crackers and a bottled water. She ate a couple. In the meantime she had pulled out the deck of cards and was setting up a game of Crazy Eights.
“Again?” Will asked, “Don’t you know any other games?”
“It’s fun though,” she said, and handed him his cards.
They played a couple hands, both of which she won, and then Will suggested they try another game, a game he used to play on rainy Saturdays with his sister. He took the deck and shuffled, removing a single ace of spades and laying it to the side. Then he handed out the cards between them and showed her how to lay down any matching cards she held. By this point she understood they were playing Old Maid. Turns out she was good at this one too, and won the first game easily. Will let her shuffle for the rematch while he finished off his now soggy bowl of cereal. From the way she handled the cards it was clear she was a more experienced hand than he. Will was impressed by her skills. He just never played cards anymore, not since he was a kid.
The door swung open and Jesse came into the room. He paused in the doorway for a moment and observed both Will and Justina on the bunk, his eyes going back and forth between them. Will stumbled to his feet and spilled the bowl of cereal all over the deck. He stood up in front of Jesse, frozen. Justina did not move and would not make eye contact.
“Will,” Jesse said finally, in a small, shaky voice, “I told Nathan already. Be sure and keep an eye on them mains whenever you do your engine room checks. They was running hot awhile ago.”
Jesse lingered in the doorway, saying nothing, and then in no real hurry went out again, just as he had come, closing the door gently behind him. Will stood there stunned by what had just happened.
“He saw you.”
Justina, who seemed more frightened by Will’s reaction to the situation than from Jesse, went over to her bunk and covered herself with the blanket and pillow.
“What’s going to happen?” she cried, “What’s going to happen to me now?”
Will did not answer her. He grabbed a dirty t-shirt from the box in the corner and began to sop up the milk, which ran in the tile grooves on the deck. But almost as soon as he started, he dropped the shirt and followed Jesse into the galley.
Jesse stood by the coffee maker with his head twisted down, watching intently for the slow drip into the pot to cease. In his hand he held a large plastic cup already half-filled with cream and sugar. Nothing, it seemed to Will, was out of the ordinary. Soon the coffee was ready and Jesse poured himself a full glass. A little splashed onto his hand and he cursed, “Sonofabitch.” Will did not say anything, but ever so slowly crept over to the coffee station. Only when he stood right in front of him did Jesse notice Will was there. Neither one spoke.
“Will,” Jesse said finally, his voice articulating each syllable, “Glad I caught up with you. Listen, I told Nathan already. Be sure and keep an eye on them mains whenever you do your engine room checks. They was running hot awhile ago.”
Will answered, “Martinez does the engine room checks when I’m on watch.”
“Oh yeah. Fuck I forgot. Sorry about that, dude.”
Here in the light of the galley Will saw the engineer’s glazed-over eyes never looked directly into his, but instead he gazed straight through him. Will had never seen Jesse look so frail before, almost elderly in his paleness. He did not even seem to care the way Will scrutinized him. Jesse took a few slow sips before turning back to the coffee station, where he spooned more sugar into the cup, his trembling hand clinking the spoon against the side. Then he turned and ambled upstairs, gripping the handrail with all his strength without so much as a word to Will, who now stood in the galley alone.















November 5
Sometime in the early morning the Etowah entered a large storm system which came from the East. The seas were not yet rough, just a slight chop, but the wind and dark clouds in the sky promised more to come in the following hours. The two deck hands stood outside the galley for some fresh air after lunch. Will sipped on a mug of hot chocolate and Nathan puffed away on his second cigarette since they came out. Instinctively each man swayed on his legs to counterbalance the motion of the boat. Wind gusts hummed through cracks in the bulwarks overhead. Rogue waves crashed up against the midship gate and sent particles of seawater and foam into the air. The deck glistened from a steady sheet of water reflecting sunlight.
Will set down his mug, gripped the headache rack, and walked slowly out to midship, his hair blown violently in all directions. He zipped up the hooded sweatshirt he wore and shoved his other hand into its front pocket. Once at midship he saw behind the port stack. The bird passengers from yesterday were gone. Then he gazed directly up at the sky and felt his stomach go weak as the deck rolled unpredictably under his feet.
He returned to where Nathan stood, staring at him from the corner of his eye.
“What?” Nathan asked, half smirking.
“You know what.”
“It was dead, man,” Nathan said, “I tossed it over the side this morning.”
“Did it drink any of the water I left it?”
“Naw, didn’t touch one drop. What you want me to do, wake you up? Call a doctor?”
“No.”
“You bummed about that bird, man?”
“I guess not,” Will replied.
“Will,” Nathan said, “That thing was sick as heck. You did all you could for it.”
“I know it.”
“You seem bummed, man,” Nathan looked at Will, concerned, “Seems like you been that way ever since we left Cameron. What’s the matter with you?”
“Nothing. I’m good.”
Nathan held the cigarette in his mouth and reached into the deck locker. He put the bread crumbs into the water dish and threw them both overboard. Then he grabbed the broom from the corner and swept the crumbs with one hand into his other. After it was clean, he shut the locker and dogged it down, tossing the crumbs onto the deck. “Just like it never happened,” he said.
“You seen Jesse today?” Will asked
“Ain’t seen him all morning. He’s probably up in his room.”
“I figured as much,” Will said, “You think it’s gonna get rough?”
“Looks like it. I know Drew was trying to get a weather report earlier. It ain’t easy though. We can’t get a good signal out here. He’s thinking about heading for the coastline to shallow waters. Tried asking Frank but you can guess how that went.”
Nathan took one last drag on the cigarette and flung it to the deck. Moments later a sheet of moving water picked it up and carried it out through the freeing port. “I gotta quit these things,” Nathan said. He waved his hand in front of him to get rid of the smoke, “They ain’t no good for me. Ain’t no good I tell you.”
“What’s the water depth out here?”
“About fifteen hundred last time I looked.”
“Damn.”
“I know,” Nathan said, looking at the clouds, “I had hoped it’d be a smooth ride the whole way down. But what you gonna do, we sailors right?”
“Whatever you say, man”
#
The entire crew of the Etowah, minus the captain, huddled around the old, wooden chart table in the center of the wheelhouse and waited patiently as a small, metallic box printed out the weather forecast for the following days. A faded map of the Gulf of Mexico was displayed underneath a sheet of plexiglass, and in blue grease pen the entire voyage to Trinidad was plotted. The many waypoints were circled in red, seven of them in all. Drew had always been meticulous when it came to plotting a course, and when a new waypoint was reached he would fill in the red circle so anyone could see at a glance how far into the voyage they were. It was still a long way to go.
Soon the electronic grind of the printer ceased and Drew ripped the forecast sheet from the roll. He walked to the helm, found his reading glasses, and studied the printout as the rest of the crew looked on.
“We all gonna die?” Martinez asked.
“Looks like we headed for some nasty shit, my friend,” Drew replied. He read down the list, “Inclement conditions in the lower Gulf. Deteriorating. Seas twenty to twenty-five feet. Heavy rains and wind. Fifty knot winds. Fuck me.”
“That wind’s already blowing twenty five or more,” Jesse observed, “Listen to that howl around them windows. How long till it blows over, bro?”
“It don’t say,” Drew said, “The paper only has information for five days. It looks like it’s gonna slack off, but it don’t say.”
“Drew,” Nathan said, “we need to get Captain Frank to make the decision to take us into shallow water. We don’t need to be out this deep in a boat like this. These some deep waters. Twenty five foot seas, or more. We don’t know. What if one of our engines go out like they been doing?”
“Calm down, Nathan. I can make an executive decision if need be.” Drew sat for a moment in thought, then said, “Will, go down and knock on Frank’s door. Yell through the door if you have to. I don’t give a shit. Tell that man we about to get into some real shit and he needs to make a decision.”
“He ain’t gonna answer,” Will said.
“Well do it anyway.”
Will descended and tried for a good five minutes to get Captain Frank to acknowledge him shouting through the door, even beating on the door, but had no luck. He returned to the wheelhouse with a shrug, “Nothing.”
“Thanks, Will,” Drew said, “Maybe them seas will knock our fearless leader up out that room.”
“Yeah, right.” Martinez said.
For the next hour the Etowah’s crew debated the best course of action to take. In the captain’s absence it was ultimately up to the mate what to do, and Drew made the decision to ride it out and see how bad it got, because although the forecast was not good, the coordinates given were only approximate. They had no real way to know how bad it would get out here, with no Coast Guard updates. The printout only said lower portions of the Gulf. The other crew did not agree and wanted to head for the Mexican coastline, for shallow water. Nathan accused Drew of being a company man.
“That’s bullshit and you know it,” Drew said, “I don’t give a shit when those motherfuckers get their equipment. Look, we out here. It ain’t bad right now. We gonna ride it out until it does get bad. I can’t believe you think I’m just trying to cover my own ass.”
Nathan said, “I just don’t follow you. If we out in seas like what that paper says is coming, then that equipment is bound to come loose and shift on the deck. Then where we gonna be? That’ll sink us quicker than high seas, as heavy as it be.”
“Now you just stirring up shit and I ain’t gonna listen to it. You just a hand. And believe it or not, this ain’t my first rodeo, and as long as I’m the acting officer we’ll do what I think is best. Understood?”
“You think it’s my first rodeo? You think I ain’t been out in a storm before. I seen what can happen. We need to find some kind of anchorage or safe harbor before it gets rough, not after.”
Martinez spoke up.
“Nathan, why you being such a pussy? Drew, he ain’t trying to hurt nobody. Be a man.”
“It ain’t about that, Martinez,” Nathan said, “But all right. Okay. Hey, I’m sorry for speaking my mind.”
“Nobody’s mad at you for speaking your mind, Nathan,” Drew interrupted, “but you got to respect the chain of command. Your opinion is duly noted. And let me tell you, first sign of water coming over the bow and we headed to Mexico beach. We gonna shack up with Martinez’s old lady.”
“She got two sisters,” Martinez told Nathan, “they pretty ugly, but they like dark meat.”
“Dark meat, huh?” Nathan said. He was furious, but at last broke into a laugh, “Dark meat. I’m a married man, you know.”
The whole crew joined him in laughter.
Drew turned the Etowah directly into the seas and took the engines out of gear. He instructed Will to make a once-around the deck to make sure things were secured and to make doubly sure all the hatches on dock were closed and dogged. He was also concerned with the chains which bound the equipment and asked Will to tie another line around the binders so they wouldn’t come loose. The rest of the crew remained in the wheelhouse and sat in near complete silence. There was an unusual sense of apprehension in the air. It felt like something was about to happen and no one wanted to miss it.
Outside the sun was low on the horizon behind a wall of clouds billowing miles above. At times a crack of sunlight would escape and cast an orange sliver over the waters, which white-capped in all directions. Will donned his slicker suit and waterproof boots and hooked the headache rack with one arm as he went. He took his time walking the deck since it was slick and he did not like the way the seas washed up against the bulwarks and threatened to come over. When the deck was finally secure he gave a thumbs up to Jesse, who had been watching him from the wheelhouse stern controls. As he approached the galley door, Will felt the boat heave slowly back to course and heard the engines engage.
Once in the galley he prepared two roast beef sandwiches, spread with spicy mustard and topped with a slice of American cheese. The first he ate while preparing the second. He took the second sandwich on a paper plate with some chips down the hall to his room. He knocked on the door and waited a bit longer than usual for her to come. Justina looked paler than normal. She took the plate from him with a smile.
“Will,” she whispered.
“What do you need?” he said, “I need to get back up there.”
“Do you think I can go?”
Will peered around the corner to make sure it was clear and led her to the head.
By the time he returned to the wheelhouse it was dark with only the slightest glimmer of twilight remaining in the western horizon. He took his place in the lookout chair. It took a few minutes before he could see anything at all, so in the meantime he listened to the crew’s conversation, which had turned from the impending storm to other matters.
“That ain’t the point at all,” Drew said, “Look here, you don’t punish the entire fleet because of one dumb motherfucker. Autopilot is great technology. That doofus on the James needs to be fired and that’s it. End of story.”
“What?” Will asked.
“You heard? The company is removing the autopilot from all the boats in the Gulf fleet.”
“That sucks.”
“Damn right,” Drew said, “how they gonna run these skeleton crews like they do and then take away the autopilot. They trying to kill the captain and mate. Bunch of nonsense if you ask me.”
“Well, I can understand,” Will argued, “I mean, it can cause accidents. Jesus, remember the time Frank almost got us all killed in Fourchon?”
Jesse asked, “When was that?”
“That motherfucker,” Martinez said, “he come down to get something to eat when he driving the boat.”
“What?”
“For real,” Will said, “We were in Fourchon heading to the BJ dock. Frank was at the wheel. It was lunchtime and we were all in the galley eating. Me, Martinez, Nathan, Tony Lovejoy, and Byron Boudreaux. We were underway. Outside the galley door you could see all the docks going by. Boats all over the place. Then all of a sudden we turn around and see Captain Frank at the stove poking around in the chicken. Everybody got real quiet and finally Martinez says, Captain, who is driving the boat? Frank looks up and says, oh, it’s on autopilot. Byron drops his fork and runs like a bolt of lightning up to the wheelhouse, and the whole time Frank just acts like business as usual. He prepares his plate, pours some sweet tea, then walks back upstairs without a care in the world.”
“You shitting me?”
“Not at all. Ask them guys. Tony Lovejoy got off the boat the next day. It was some shit.”
“But Will,” Drew added, “yes that was some fucked up shit, and may well have caused an accident, but that wasn’t the autopilot’s fault, was it? That was crazy ass Frank Davenport.”
“No, I guess not,” Will admitted, “But still. The technology allowed him to do something like that.”
“You have a point, but ultimately you got to hire responsible people. You guys heard what happened to the Seaco Grayhorse right?”
“What?”
“It was a few years ago. You don’t remember that?”
“You mean when that crew got killed?” Jesse asked.
“Right,” Doug said, “Not the whole crew though. But most of them.”
“What happened?”
“A few winters ago the Grayhorse was working out of Venice. They was underway to the dock and it was a normal night, no fog or rough seas. Just a calm night. Well, for some reason the AB was the only one in the wheelhouse, driving the boat alone. He had it on autopilot of course and fell asleep at the wheel. Turns out their course line took them right through the middle of a rabbit patch. I been to the block where it happened and let me tell you what. They’s platforms all over the place out there, some of them unlit. And sure enough, they collided with one going about twelve knots. The impact sheared off the cabin, crushing the AB inside. Killed four other crewmembers, including the captain. They found the crew dead in their bunks with broken necks. I saw photos of the wreckage in one of the trade magazines around the time it happened. Looked like a giant can of sardines the way the iron was all torn and curled-up. The whole bow caved-in.”
“Fucking hell,” Jesse said, “That’s a damn shame. All that because of an autopilot.”
“It was the ABs fault,” Drew said, “Not the autopilot.”
“And the officers who let him up there alone,” Nathan added.
“That’s why,” Jesse said, “you make damn sure you trust the motherfuckers you be sailing with. Man, sometimes I can’t sleep at night when I know there’s a fool up here calling the shots, with my life in his hands.”
“Same here. I feel you,” Nathan said.
“Who survived?”
“I think it was the oiler or another hand. He was hurt bad, but it didn’t kill him.”
“Can you imagine what that must have been like?” Nathan said, “Everything’s quiet then all of a sudden boom! you go flying across the room. Can you imagine what must have been going through that man’s head? He must have been afraid the boat was going to sink with him inside.”
“I’d like to talk to that guy,” Will said, “wonder if he still works out here.”
“Who knows? He’s probably sitting pretty right about now.”
“That’s for sure. You know somebody got sued over that.”
Drew said, “Talk about getting sued, that reminds me of this time I was on the Ruby. We was working for this rig out of Freshwater City, and there was a dive boat on the job with us. They had some welding to do at the base of the hole. Every morning after breakfast they’d gear up and make a dive. Well, we had been tied up to the rig for like a week straight, so we could see everything that went on over there on that dive boat. There were four divers down at a time, and each diver had a man up top he communicated with by radio. The man up top is responsible for the man in the water from the time he goes in until the time he comes out. One day one of them divers came up too quick and got sick. Real bad sick. Started with the bends. We heard them on the radio talking to the medic on the rig. That night it got even worse and the diver became unconscious. I remember the rig lowered a basket made especially for an unconscious man and they lifted him up and flew him by helicopter straight to the hospital in New Orleans.”
“Diving is some dangerous shit,” Jesse added, “and the way they do it out here is fucked up. Everything’s rushed all the time. You can’t be rushing that shit. Not when there’s lives at stake.”
“That ain’t even the fucked up part,” Drew said, “The fucked up part came a day or two later. We heard the next morning that the diver had died on the way to the hospital. The news of that put everybody into a funk, but it really messed with the guy who was responsible for the diver. The reason I know this is because he got sick and they were talking on the radio and got some anxiety medication for him. Said he was acting all crazy and talking nonsense. Well, another day goes by and we hear more news. That same guy tried to hang himself in the head with a piece of wire. They carried him to the hospital by helicopter and that’s the last we heard about it. Don’t know what happened to that guy, but the family of the diver who died sued the company for three million dollars. Heard about that a few months later, which is what made me remember it.”
“I don’t know if I could handle that,” Nathan said, “if somebody died on the crew. I might have to go to the house after that. I don’t know man. You know what the worse part would be? It would be how everything would just go back to normal after. Like it never even happened. You know that’s how it would be too. The very next day they’d be on the radio, Etowah River, we need you go to the Hydco dock and take on some drill pipe. I mean, after all that. Somehow that ain’t right.”
“For sure that’s how it is,” Martinez spoke up. He had been quiet during most of the conversation and sat apart from the others, at the bulk pumping station, “I was there when Seabiscuit died three years ago.”
“On the Charles?” Nathan asked.
“Yes, my friend. It was a bad time for everybody.”
“What happened?” Will asked, “You never talked about it before. I knew it happened, but you never talk about it.”
“No, my friend,” Martinez said, “I never talk about it.”
Jesse asked, “Why not? I worked with Seabiscuit. He was good people. Worthless as an AB, but he was a good guy. I know he got hit by a line, but that’s all. So you were there when it happened?”
“Like I say, Jesse, I was there. I’m not trying to keep a secret from nobody. It was rough that night at the rig. The mate on watch was lazy motherfucker from Pensacola. Captain Ray used to call him Mattress Back cause he sleep all the time. So we at the rig doing weather patterns, back and forth all day. Too rough to tie up. When mate come on watch, first thing he do is say we need to find a platform to hang off. Fuck this weather pattern bullshit, he say. So he finds a platform a few miles away and we go there. Me and Seabiscuit and engineer were in the galley. We cook a pizza that night. Mate calls on the phone and say go outside and tie off to platform. We go out there and man it’s rough. The stern is going up and down like a seesaw. Seas coming over the stern. But we go back there. Mate take forever to get boat lined up to the bit on the platform. In the meantime we pull out the long tie-off line and fake it on the deck. It was a mess. Water everywhere. The deck was full of pipe and equipment so we couldn’t move around too good. Seabiscuit say he don’t care if he gets wet so he walk right to the bit, carrying the eye. We have to wave to the mate for him to back up more. The engines wide open now. Seabiscuit takes five tries to throw the eye onto the bit. It hit the water and get waterlogged so now it’s heavy. I yell for him to let me try, but he mad now. He say no man, and keep throwing the line at the bit. We can see this bit is no good anyway. It was too small, rusted, look liked termites ate it. One of the horns was missing. Finally Seabiscuit loops it and lets out some slack and I tie it off. We give thumbs up to mate. He lets the engines out of gear and the line go tight pretty quick. We all stand back out of the way and watch in case something happens. Finally I say let’s go inside people. It’s too dangerous out here. I go inside, but halfway up the deck I hear a loud pop. I look back and Seabiscuit is face down on the deck. The water is rolling over him. I yell to the engineer and we run back there. Now I can see the boat is drifting away from the platform. What happened was the other horn tore off. The eye snap back onto the boat like a rubber band and hit Seabiscuit in the head. Knock him out, but he was still breathing.”
“How you know it hit him in the head?” Jesse asked.
“Well, we didn’t know but a few minutes later his head swell up. Me and the engineer pick him up and carry him to the galley and lay him down on settee. He awake now, but barely awake. The phone was ringing. I answer and mate is yelling at me to get my ass on deck so we can tie up again. I tell him Seabiscuit is hurt and we can’t tie up cause the horn came off the bit. He says okay and for Seabiscuit to come up soon and take the wheel. I hang up on that motherfucker. Engineer is with Seabiscuit. He has some aspirin and water but Seabiscuit don’t want it. He say, no man. I’m cool, I’m cool. We going to tie up again? No I say to him. The bit broke. That’s how you got hit in the head. He laugh and say, man that was a hard hit. Maybe I take an aspirin. So he stand up for a minute and go over to cabinet and pour a glass of water. He don’t realize we already have aspirin and water for him, even though we say. Engineer say Seabiscuit why don’t you go change your wet clothes? Seabiscuit say oh man I didn’t even notice I was all wet. What happened to me? I say you got hit in the head with the line and you was on the deck. Oh man he say. I better go up to wheelhouse and see if Mike need me. He walk around in a circle like he don’t know which way is wheelhouse. He come back to the galley table. Oh man, he say. I got a headache. I need to lay down for only a minute. Then he lay down on the bench and close his eyes. Never get up again.”
Martinez rose out of his chair and told the crew he was going to make an engine room check. He descended quietly and everyone else was silent for minutes. Each man seemed lost in his own thoughts. The only sound was the moan of wind around the cabin. Drew asked Will to take the helm while he had a smoke, and when he opened the side door there was the sound of the steady rush of water going by.
“That was a good man,” Nathan said, finally, “I worked with him a couple times. He was always nice to me.”
“I never knew him. Why’d they call him Seabiscuit?” Drew asked.
“Because he was slow,” Jesse replied, “man must have been in his late fifties. He was overweight so he couldn’t move around for shit. Folks started calling him Seabiscuit to fuck with him, you know after that racehorse.”
“Yeah.”
“Wonder what happened to that mate?” Will said.
“Mike something. That sonofabitch was laughing about it two weeks later,” said Jesse, “he worked behind the office for awhile.”
“They didn’t fire his ass?”
“Nah.”
“Laughing about it?”
“Rango said so awhile back, when I went to safety school. Stayed back there. He said he heard that guy talking about it to a group of green hands. Motherfucker was bragging about it. How them hands need to watch out if they come to his boat cause he’s gonna have your ass out there in fifteen foot seas tying up, and people be dying on his watch. Fucking miserable prick.”
“Jesus,” Will said, “how does somebody get like that?”
“He sorry,” Drew said, “his mama didn’t raise him to give a shit about others. They’s people like that in the world, believe it or not.”
“Just like them birds,” Will said.
“How you figure?” Jesse asked.
“Same thing in my mind, not looking out for your own.”
“Will, they animals,” Drew said.
Jesse shook his head, “Ain’t the same thing at all. Them birds are just trying to survive the best they can. That mate ain’t did what he did for survival. He’s just an asshole.”
“I don’t see the difference,” Will said, “Neither one showed any compassion for another life.”
“Well, maybe in that way they are the same, but there ain’t nothing wrong with survival. That’s just the way life is. What you think we doing out here? We surviving. Don’t take this the wrong way, but I don’t work on a boat cause I’m in love with you motherfuckers. I’m out here so I can feed my kids and wife. You talk about compassion like it’s something other than survival, but that ain’t so. Every living thing acts according to its own best interest. You just have to look hard enough. There ain’t no exception to that, even when you think you witness some selfless act of compassion, if you look close enough you bound to find some selfish interest in there. It’s true. On the other hand, take them birds. From your point of view they did an uncompassionate thing by not helping one of their own. But tell me this, what would have happened if them birds hadn’t shunned the sick one? What if they brought it into their little flock. I tell you what would have happened. The other ones would have caught what it had and now the whole group would be dead. You’re telling me the whole group dying is better than just the one? How is that compassionate? Life is survival. It’s all about propagating the species and having a good time while we’re here propagating. You just looking at it from the wrong direction. Them birds didn’t let one die. They saved six others from dying.”
“Well,” Will said, “when you put it like that it’s hard to argue.”
“That’s cause it’s the truth. Can’t argue with the truth. And let me tell you what, humans is just the same. We ain’t no different from them birds. Imagine one of us gets sick with some contagious virus. What you think is gonna happen? Let me ask you, Will. Say I got some virus that kills you dead in twenty four hours. How are you going to treat me?”
“I wouldn’t just leave you for dead. We would do something. Call the Coast Guard or try to help. I would think.”
“Would you personally tend to me? Say I was unconscious. Say I had a fever and needed immediate attention and you could help if you wanted. But you know that if you do, you will likely catch the same virus and die yourself. What are you going to do now?”
“I don’t know what I’d do, Jesse. I don’t know man.”
“I do. You’d do everything you could not to catch that virus, even if it meant letting me die. And I don’t blame you. Ain’t nothing to be ashamed about. It’s nature. We like robots programmed not to do certain things, and one of them things is not to harm your self.”
“I guess you have a point,” Will said, “but let me put the shoe on the other foot. You say that self-preservation is natural, and I agree with that. It’s stupid not to agree. It’s obviously true. But what if it was your own son that caught the virus? What if Toby was on the boat and he got sick. Your family. What would you do in that situation?”
“That ain’t the same thing. Toby is me. He’s my own. It’s like if my arm got infected. Of course I’m going to help him. He’s no different from me. So it’s the same self-preservation instinct, extended to include him. You ain’t gonna get me on that. I know what I’m saying. I would help me son with no hesitation. And let me go one further. If any of you motherfuckers had harmed my son or put my son or family in danger, I would kill you where you stand. I don’t have nothing against you guys, but if you harmed my kids you would have to die. Will, you can’t understand that cause you don’t have any kids of your own. But you will someday. My son is me. My family is me. So just like I would fight to the death if someone attacked me, out of self-defense, I would do the same for them. It’s natural and there ain’t nothing wrong with that, is there?”
“I guess not,” Will admitted, “I mean I guess I never really thought about it.”
“Blood is forever,” Drew added.
Nathan broke into the conversation, “You do got a point, Jesse, and I find it hard to argue with a lot of what you say, but then I remember what Jesus came to teach us, that our family is bigger than blood. He taught us that every man and every woman in this world is the children of God. And more than that, everything in creation is our brothers and sisters if we understand Him to be the Father. So, by your own argument, we should be happy to give our life for anything, just as if it were ourselves. We should be happy to, for even the most creeping crawling thing there be, since we are all kinfolk under the Father. We should be that way.”
“In that case,” Will said, “would you attack somebody who attacked your daughters, Nathan? Going from what Jesse said about killing anyone who threatened his family. What would you do in that situation?”
“I think that’s obvious from what I said,” Nathan seemed surprised at the question and became defensive, “since we all kinfolk under the Father, there ain’t no killing of others. Would you kill your daddy or your brother if they attacked you?”
“No.”
“Right, cause like Jesse said, they you. Your own. What the Lord came to tell us is that all of creation is our family. So if a stranger comes up to me and say he’s gonna slit my throat unless I give him my wallet, then I give him my wallet and my bank account number.”
“Horseshit,” Jesse broke in, “That’s horseshit, man. That might be nice to talk about on Sunday morning and I’d love to live in a world where everybody was nice and giving to every other thing, but that ain’t the way it is. You want proof? Turn on the news any day of the week. The fact is people is scum. Not all people. But a lot is. And what you gonna do if that stranger don’t want no money, say he just want to slit your throat or rape your daughters, what you gonna do then? Cause there’s people like that in the world. Bet your ass.”
“I confess,” Nathan continued, “I don’t know what I’d do, but I would pray that God would give me the answer in the day and in the hour.”
“So you’d just stand by praying while a stranger rapes your daughters. That’s mighty Christian of you. I don’t know what to say man. That don’t seem right to me. All right, you say all of nature is our brothers and sisters, so why don’t you go jump in the water and explain to your brother the shark about them Christian ideas you been brain-washed with. I’m willing to bet it wouldn’t think twice about gobbling your ass up, and I’m willing to double-down that you would fight it off the best you could, even if it meant killing.”
“I can only say that I would hope I would have the strength not to resist evil.”
“Wait a minute,” Will said, “what’s evil about the shark trying to get some food? That shark ain’t malicious. It ain’t evil. It’s just an animal needing sustenance. We all do. I mean, if God exists then he made the world that way. We all have to eat. Were you being evil when you ate that chicken Martinez cooked today? If so, it sure looked like you enjoy the hell out of being evil.”
“Will,” Jesse laughed, “man, that’s the first reasonable thing you said all hitch. We a part of nature, and the way of nature is to kill and self-preserve, and to live by the flesh of other living things. There ain’t no evil in nature. It’s innocent. It’s people who fucks everything up with religion and over-analyzing everything to death.”
“I can’t argue with you folks,” Nathan conceded, “All I know is the Bible says we are not to resist evil and that we must love our adversaries. It also says nature is fallen, and the Bible is the word of God, therefore I believe in the Word.”
“Why don’t you think for yourself?” Will asked.
“I do think for myself, Will. I decide to believe what I believe. I don’t want to live in a world where everything is just about its own survival. I want to live in a world of goodness, of harmony, where everything loves one another in the light of God’s grace. And let me tell you what, Will, you can’t wait for it to come. You got to live life the way you want the world to be, not the way it is.”
“I don’t know what I believe,” Will admitted.
“Well, you got to know sooner or later.”
“Look,” Will said, “I do know I don’t feel like being preached at right now. I do know I don’t believe in a carpenter rising from the dead like a fucking zombie and saving humanity from its sins. I know that much, Nathan.”
Jesse laughed. Nathan rose out of his chair and walked to the stairs.
“Well, that’s up to you. That’s totally up to you. And I apologize for trying to preach at you, Will. I thought we was just having a civilized conversation. Okay gentlemen. I’ve had enough of this kind of talk for one night. It’s my bedtime anyway. I pray those seas calm tonight and we can have a safe journey from here on out.”
Nathan descended the stairs. A few moments later Jesse spoke up again, as if remembering something. “Besides,” he said, “you only tried to help that bird yesterday cause you knew it wouldn’t hurt you. That’s all they was to that. If you knew it had some contagious disease I guarantee you wouldn’t have gone near that thing even with the goddamned boat hook.”











November 6
The bow of the Etowah heaved up the crest of another wave and by reflex alone Will shifted his body’s weight to compensate for the motion. Hours of this had exhausted him to the point of sweat. Every once in awhile the vessel veered off course and took a wave on its side. This caused the boat to roll hard twenty degrees to one side and felt to Will as if it might capsize at any second. In these moments his heart raced and he braced both arms against the sides of the bunk. That was all he could do.
He switched on the bunk light overhead and directed its dim beam onto the clock on the far wall. Seven thirty. Four more hours to lay there in the dark and rest, or try to rest, before his watch began. As of yet he had not slept a wink. The seas had steadily increased in the hours since he went off watch. He pulled out the bottled water stuffed between the mattress and the wall and took a drink. Already the warmth from the bunk light made him queasy. He switched it off.
It was quiet in the room except for the sound of the calendar on the opposite wall sliding back and forth with the movement of the boat. He had heard nothing from Justina’s bunk for hours, but knew she could not be sleeping either. Not in seas like this. Will was not in his regular bunk. He lay now on the spare bunk just across from hers because at three in the morning the Etowah went into side seas, tossing Will violently from his top bunk onto the deck. It happened so fast he only had time to flail his arms helplessly as he came down. Justina heard the fall and reached out to help him. He grabbed her arm and lifted himself up again. He then climbed into the vacant bunk across from hers, which was at a much safer distance from the deck.
A vessel the size of the Etowah did not capsize easily in these waters, yet in certain sea conditions it could happen, and had happened before. Side seas were the most dangerous to be in, as the boat could get caught in the trough of a wave and be rolled over by the next one. When it had happened it was normally a cumulative effect, as the seas in the Gulf were not typically high enough to capsize a boat the size of the Etowah in one go, except maybe in hurricane or tropical storm conditions. The boat would first be rolled on its side at maybe ten degrees, nothing severe, then before it had a chance to correct itself another wave would come and roll it another ten degrees, and so on until it rolled over completely. This is especially likely in the Gulf of Mexico as its seas have a dangerously short frequency in comparison to those found on the open ocean, where the seas may be forty or fifty feet high, yet are not considered as dangerous, since the frequency of the waves are long and there is ample time for the vessel to correct itself.
As he lay there, Will contemplated his escape route from the boat if it did capsize. This was something he often did at night when the seas were rough and he could not sleep. There are standard procedures for abandoning ship in rough seas: gathering water jugs and canned food, deploying life rafts, grabbing the radars and radar beacons. But in reality these procedures are in place for peace of mind more than for usefulness. In certain circumstances it would work, if the vessel is slowly taking on water, and the captain has time to radio for help, and the seas are calm. But at times like this, when the seas are violent and the boat is heaving in all directions and you can barely walk up the stairs then it’s practically useless and bound to go wrong. And if the boat capsized it was all over. That didn’t prevent Will from imagining what he would do, however.
If the Etowah capsized completely, meaning the cabin and wheelhouse were underwater and the hull was exposed to the air, then Will figured his room was as good a place to be as any on the boat, since he would be that much closer to the surface. First thing, he would likely be thrown onto the overhead, which would now be the deck. Assuming he was not unconscious, he figured the biggest problem would be all the water flooding in through the galley door, or perhaps from the stairs leading to the upper decks. For this reason he would not don his life vest until he was outside the boat, as he would not be able to fight the current to get outside in the buoyancy of the vest. Instead he would carry his life vest out of the room. If he managed to fight the strong influx of water and swim outside the galley door, the next challenge would be to hold his breath, since the deck would be directly overhead and he would have to swim all the way around in order to reach the surface. It seemed very likely he would lose the life vest in the process, but supposing he did manage to keep it and make it up to the surface, then he would put it on and find any part of the hull he could climb onto, perhaps at the stern where the propellers are, that is, once the engines had flooded and stopped turning. The vessel life rafts each have a safety latch which fires automatically one it reaches a certain water depth, and releases the raft. But if the boat is capsized, even if they do launch, it seemed unlikely to Will they would make it to the surface intact. There was also the EPIRB, which is a device that sends out an emergency signal for help, also rigged to launch automatically if underwater. So supposing the EPIRB made it to the surface, all Will would need to do is stay with the vessel, or more accurately the EPIRB, until help arrived. Considering how far out they were, that would take some time. Thinking all this through never helped the panic which came over him when the boat rolled into a deep trough, but it kept his mind occupied when he couldn’t sleep.
#
“Will?” Justina said, her voice weak.
“I’m over here.”
“Are you asleep?”
“Yes.”
“I’m not.”
“Sucks don’t it.”
“Does it get any worse than this?”
“Much worse.”
“Then I am never going to sleep again,” she groaned.
“These aren’t too bad. Only five to seven footers. You feel it more because we’re riding at full speed. The best thing to do is just rest even if you can’t sleep.”
“Talk to me. Tell me something about the boat, something to get my mind off this. I feel like I’m going to be sick.”
“I’m tired of talking about the boat all the time. I’m tired of doing all the talking. You tell me something, if you want to talk so bad.”
“No.”
“Okay,” Will said, “we’ll just lay here in the dark miserable then.”
“Don’t be mad at me, Will. I don’t feel good.”
“I’m not mad. Just tired is all. Not even sure I feel like talking.”
“Okay.”
A few moments went by in silence. Will heard Justina shift in her bunk. A particularly large wave hit them on the port side, causing a locker door to swing open. Will rose and latched it, then returned to his bunk.
“Fuck,” Tina said, “I hate this. I hate it so much.”
“You get used to it.”
“Used to it, that’s what you always say. How do you work in this? You like this?”
“It has its moments,” Will said.
“Whatever.”
“Well, what do you do for work?”
“Nothing.”
“Well, what work would you like? Say you had all the money in the world and you could do anything you wanted. What would you do?”
“If I had all the money, why work?”
“But that’s not the point of the question, is it?”
“I can’t tell you.”
Will sighed, “What do you mean?”
“There is something I want to do, but what if I tell you and it doesn’t come true.”
“Sooner or later you will have to share it with others. Otherwise it’s just a dream.”
There was a long pause before she spoke again, “Don’t laugh, but what I really want to do is become an animal doctor, a veterinarian.”
“Yeah?”
“Do you think that’s a dumb thing to do?”
“Why would it be dumb?”
“You think I could really do it?”
“Sure.”
“Really?”
“Yes, for God’s sake.”
“But I haven’t been to school for a long time. What if I can’t pass the tests?”
“You have to study is all.”
“I hate to study.”
“Me too.”
“But, Will,” Justina said, “You think I could really do it?”
“I’ll tell you what you do. First you go back to school. Get your degree. Then in the meantime find a vet office and go work for them, like an assistant. Then you have your foot in the door whenever you graduate.”
“I could do that.”
“Sure you could.”
“I mean I know a veterinarian who lives down the road from me.”
“That’s perfect.”
“I didn’t even think about that. He would probably let me come work with him.”
“There you go.”
“That’s what I’m going to do then,” Justina said, “as soon as I get somewhere the ground doesn’t move.”
Will said, “What made you want to become a veterinarian?”
“Different things,” she said, “but there was one time I can remember. There was this dog outside our house, a stray. We heard him whining real early in the morning. My papa got out of bed and told me to stay put. But I went out there anyway. The dog was whining because he had a fishing line wrapped around his tongue. Somehow it happened. But the line had cut off all the circulation and his tongue was a dark purple color. My papa tried to reach in there to get it loose but the dog snapped at his hand. We knew it would be better to take him to the vet, so first thing in the morning we took him there and the nice man was able to remove the fishing line just like that. He didn’t even charge us no money for doing it. Ever since that day I thought I would like to do that too.”
“That’s a good story.”
“Yes.”
“What ever happened to the dog?”
“Hey stayed with us for awhile, but then he ran away and we never saw him again.”
“I see,” Will shifted in his bunk, “still, it was a nice story. I’m glad you told me.”
“Me too.”
“You say you are not a good person, but that was a good story.”
“That’s different.”
“How is it different? It’s you in the story, is it not?”
“Yes.”
“You know,” Will said, “you remind me of something Nathan used to say.”
“I remember you talking about him.”
“Well, he used to get on his soapbox and preach to anybody who’d listen. And one time he said, the problem with the world ain’t that people ain’t good. People ain’t never been good, he said. The real problem with the world is that nobody strives for goodness. Not no more. You reminded me of that when you said you weren’t a good person. I thought about that.”
After a moment Justina said, “I like Nathan.”
“Me too.”
They did not speak afterwards for a long time. There was only the sound of the calendar on the wall and the waves beating against the hull. Will lay there without sleeping and thought about many things. “Hell, I ain’t good,” he said at last, as if continuing the same conversation from before, although it had been at least an hour since anybody spoke, “Sometimes I look at my life and I’m disgusted by it,” he said, “I just take and take and take. I never give.”
But there was no response from Justina, as she had since fallen asleep, and it was not very long before Will joined her.
#
At eleven thirty-five, with twenty minutes more until Will had to get out of bed, there came a rapid knock at the door. The doorknob turned but did not open.
“Hey Will, it’s Nathan. Sorry to bother you, man. We need your help on the deck. The lines done come loose and they washing overboard.”
“All right,” Will shouted, “Don’t come in. I’m coming. I’m coming now.”
Will rose out of bed in the dark and felt his way to the wooden locker out of which he pulled his rubber boots. He slid them on, balancing on either foot, and instantly felt the energy drain from his body, nauseous. He ignored the feeling and went out, wiping his eyes, and still wearing the clothes he had on yesterday.
Looking out the galley door window, Will saw Nathan in his yellow slicker fighting with a mooring line which had gone over at the midship gate. Quickly he unraveled his own slicker from the corner of the laundry room and sat on the deck to put it on. He could not slide the pants over his boots, so he had to remove those. Doing this efficiently while the boat heaved with the seas proved difficult, especially in his weakened state. Soon they were on and Will grabbed a slice of white bread and stuffed it into his mouth as he went out the door.
The cold air invigorated him. The sky was clear blue, spotted with clouds here and there. It was a beautiful day in contrast to the seas below, which heaved and white-capped as far as the eye could see. Walking onto the deck, Will understood at once why the seas were so bad, the wind was blowing at thirty knots, maybe more. Nathan saw Will and shouted to him, cupping his hands around his mouth.
“Drew turned into the seas so it wouldn’t be so bad on us, but the seas are confused so watch out for rogue waves!”
Will gave a thumbs up and surveyed the mess. Most of the mooring lines were loose and washing overboard, five or six of them, spread in yellow and black tangles all across the deck. He went directly to the gate where Nathan fought with a line. Will followed it with his eyes, floating on the surface of the water all the way back past the stern.
“Take a break,” Will shouted, “let me pull on it for awhile.”
“Man, there ain’t no breaks,” Nathan yelled, “we have to get these lines back on the boat now before one gets caught in the wheel, or else we’ll be sitting ducks in these seas. Here, help me pull it in.”
They heaved and pulled together and five minutes later the entire two-hundred foot line was all back on the deck in a pile. Will’s arms and legs were exhausted, and it was just the first line. He stopped the stretch them and felt the queasiness return. Nathan ran over to the next line going over, and Will began to fake the line back onto the headache rack. Nathan saw him.
“Will,” Nathan said, “don’t put them lines on the headache rack. They’ll just come loose again. We need to put them in the deck lockers instead.”
Will fought with the line with all his strength attempting to untangle it, but so far he had only succeeded in frustrating himself.
“You want to run the show now?” Will snapped, “Fuck off. I know what I’m doing.”
“Come on, Will. We need to get these lines out the water. Drew disengaged the port engine where they all overboard. Help me get these lines out the water first.”
“Go fuck yourself,” Will shouted, “I’m gonna put these lines up like you say, in the deck locker. You go do that if you want, since you know everything. We got to do this too, or they’ll go over again. I ain’t no green hand.”
Will grabbed a portion of the line from the bottom and started pulling it forward, which was not successful at all. He finally managed to get it free and dragged it to the port deck locker. He opened the locker and fought with the line, snagged on the hose rack, shoving it inside the best he could.
Nathan was at the port midship, heaving on a line which had gone out the small freeing port. It was stuck and difficult to get loose, being wet.
Suddenly the boat lurched to the starboard into side seas. The next wave crashed into the Etowah’s port side head on and crested over the bulwarks where Nathan stood. A large mass of seawater overtook him. It picked him up and easily carried him with it down the length of the deck towards the stern.
“Nathan!”
Will left the line at the locker and ran towards the stern, but slipped on the deck and fell hard onto his side. He rose instantly and saw Nathan at the stern bulwarks fighting to get up again. By the time Will reached him, Nathan was on his feet again. He stood there with a dazed look in his eyes.
“Hey,” Will asked, “you okay? Holy shit. That wave carried you all the way down the deck.”
“I almost went overboard,” Nathan said, as if talking to himself, “I was on top and it was carrying me over the side. I could see the water from up above.”
The boat had turned square into the seas again. Nathan was soaked from head to toe. Water dripped from his beard and he stood there unsure what to do next.
“Well, look,” Will suggested, in an attempt to lighten the mood, “now that we back here, we might as well haul in these lines.”
Nathan grinned and they both took turns heaving on one line that had gone out a stern freeing port. Before long they had a system. Once they had one line completely on the deck, they would both haul it forward and pile it into the deck locker. It was a slow process. The more Will became exhausted from the hauling, the more his seasickness returned. Looking out towards the horizon helped, but did not completely rid him of the weakness.
After what seemed like an eternity, but was really about thirty minutes, all the lines were stacked inside the deck locker. They were piled so high it almost reached the overhead.
Nathan and Will walked to the galley door and removed their safety vests. They took off their slicker suits outside and sprayed them with the garden hose to remove all the salt water, then hung them on the galley hatch. Nathan stood there in his wet thermal shirt and jeans. They clung to his skinny frame.
“Thanks for your help, Will,” Nathan said, “Guess I don’t have to take a shower now. Well I got salt water all over me so I guess I do anyhow.”
“It was my fault,” Will admitted, “I know it was my fault.”
“I don’t think it would have mattered, Will. Once them seas started coming over the bulwarks them lines was bound to come loose sooner or later. Can’t fight mother nature.”
“And I’m sorry about yesterday,” Will continued, “I was in some kind of mood. But now I can see it was me and not you. It wasn’t right of me to talk about your religion that way. You are a decent person and I acted like a fool yesterday. I feel ashamed of the way I spoke to you and I’m sorry.”
Nathan did not answer, but after a few moments he nodded as if he understood. He said, “Thank you, Will.”
They went inside. By then it was twelve-thirty. Will was completely exhausted, and when he saw the time his heart sank. His watch had only just begun. Nobody could cook in weather like this, so Nathan put in a frozen pizza for something hot they could munch on.
Thirty minutes later Will pulled it from the oven and set it on the counter, with a small towel underneath so it would not slide. He called Drew on the phone to see if he wanted any. He didn’t, but asked Will to come to the wheelhouse as soon as he finished. Will inhaled his first slice in two bites. His hunger overtook him and before long he had eaten another two slices, barely tasting it. Still hungry, but not wanting to eat the entire pizza, Will went to the cabinet and took out a box of Frosted Flakes. He poured a bowl with some milk and downed that. He then found some leftovers in the walk-in and prepared a bowl of seafood gumbo in the microwave. Finally his hunger was satiated. He took two more slices of pizza, folded them inside a paper towel, took a Coke from the refrigerator, and went to his room.
He knocked four times before Justina came to the door. When she finally did he handed her the pizza and Coke but did not go in. She could barely stand up in this weather, no sea legs. Will made sure the door was locked and closed it again. He went upstairs.
“Will,” Drew said, “I need to talk to you.”
“What about?”
“What you think what about?” About why them lines were scattered all over the deck back there. Nathan said you took responsibility to secure them lines when we went offshore. What you got to say for yourself?”
“Man, I don’t know,” Will began, “I secured them like I always do. You know I do it right.”
Drew looked at Will in suspicion.
“I don’t guess I have to tell you how dangerous it is in seas like this if a line was to get caught in one of them propellers. We’d be floating out here at the mercy of the weather, get into side seas and capsize just like that. That what you want?”
Will did not respond. He only sat down in the lookout chair and gazed at the horizon.
“Where you put them lines at?”
“In the deck locker.”
“All of em?”
“Yeah.”
“Good,” Drew said, “Then I guess we don’t have to worry about it anymore. How’s that equipment look back there? Did it shift at all?”
“It’s good. Hasn’t moved.”
“One more thing. When you come on watch and the weather is bad like this I need you to come up here first thing, you understand?”
“Me and Nathan were out there on the deck when I came on.”
“I know this, but what did you do when you got back inside? Plopped down in that galley and got you something to eat. It was a half hour before you came up. You need to check on the officer at the helm. Maybe I need to piss or something. I mean, my God, have a little consideration for your fellow crew members. I don’t think that’s asking too much.”
“You should have called me if you needed to piss.”
“I shouldn’t have to call you,” Doug shouted, “I don’t want to hear shit like that, Will. You a grown man. You should be responsible and do your job right. Now hold this. I do got to piss. We ain’t on autopilot. Them seas is too rough. I’m just steering at line into them seas at the moment. Try not to go off course too much, so them fellas can maybe get some rest.”
Drew descended and Will sat at the helm and steered a course into the seas, but it was not easy. The waves battered the boat to one side. This meant he had to over-correct the course to maintain the right heading, and then inevitably he would veer off too far in the other direction. Ten minutes later Drew returned and lay down on the settee and tried to rest. Will drove, steering a heading with a slight course correction to get them back on the right track again. This put them slightly off-center in relation to the seas and caused the Etowah to heave and bounce in unpredictable ways.
#
“Man, I think I’m gonna be sick.”
“You think?” Drew asked.
“Pretty sure.”
Drew rose from the settee and replaced Will at the helm. Will went downstairs to the head on the second level. On the way down his legs wobbled. And each time the boat came down the back side of a wave he felt he might collapse under the gravity. He gripped the toilet with both arms and the smell of sewage suffocated him. He immediately wretched and vomited everything he had eaten. When he smelled the specific things he had just eaten, and when he saw chunks of food he recognized it made him wretch even more. Just when he thought it was over it came again. After a few minutes he had no strength left at all. “Give me strength,” he muttered into the bowl, “Please give me strength.” Soon he was heaving only air and wretched so hard at times that he was half afraid his stomach might spew from his mouth.
Will could not gauge how long he had been down there, but soon he remembered all the things Drew had told him about responsibility and consideration and felt like he ought to get back upstairs.
For the moment the queasiness had passed, so he rose slowly and climbed the stairs, but he was still too weak to ascend whenever the boat rose up onto the crest of a wave and the gravity pressed against him. But at last he made it and stood next to Drew. The weather did not seem to bother Drew, and he had even lit up a cigarette in the meantime.
“You got this?” Drew asked.
“I think so.”
Before Will took the helm he stumbled over to the door and propped it open. A blast of cold wind came in and the cigarette smoke dissipated. He took over and once again Drew collapsed on the settee and pulled the blanket over his head.
Twenty minutes later, however, it was Will who lay on the settee curled up into a ball. He moaned and shivered in fits. An air conditioner vent sat just above the settee and blew a constant stream of cold air, but Will did not have the strength to reach up and close it.
A front had moved in over the last few hours and the sky was now a smooth sheet of gray. The front had brought with it a change in the seas and for the time being they were confused, knocking the Etowah in chaotic directions. This made Will feel even worse as he could not anticipate where or when the next wave would hit. In the meantime, Drew smoked cigarettes one after the other with little concern for Will’s condition.
When he had been seasick in the past, the boat had always been relatively close to shore, so there was always that small chance of reprieve, that they might turn tail and head to the dock. But out here there was no chance of turning back and Will knew he would have to suffer any weather for as long as it lasted. He felt worse than dying. He felt death would be preferable to this feeling. Someone said there are two stages of seasickness. The first stage is feeling like you are going to die and the second stage is the realization that you won’t. Of the two, the second is by far the worse.
#
It was nine in the evening and the Etowah was back on course. The seas were now hitting them from roughly head-on, so the boat only made headway at six or seven knots. Voyaging at this speed would slow their progress considerably if it kept up. Drew had been at the helm for hours while Will continued to be sick. For Will the hours had felt like an eternity of trips to the head and back again.
Martinez came up at one point and took the wheel while Drew took a piss break. He tried talking to Will but Will was not in a talking mood. When Drew returned Martinez walked over to the settee.
“Hey Will, follow me to the deck, I want to show you a fish that wash on board with a wave. I stomp on his head with my boot.”
“Don’t,” Will moaned.
“Don’t?” Martinez said, “What’s the matter, you seasick? But I need to show you this fish.”
Will waved him away. Martinez walked to Drew, who had not spoken since he returned.
“I like when is rough like now. It’s good. I don’t like when it’s too calm and you can sleep in your bed at night.”
“Is that right?” Drew asked.
Drew and Martinez talked about the sea conditions for awhile. Will heard everything, as he was only ten feet away, but did not process any of the conversation. Soon he heard Martinez’s voice close to him again.
“It’s okay, Will. I show you the fish another time. Maybe we fry his brains and eat them with eggplant and pancakes and lots of mayonnaise. How that sounds?”
“You motherfucker,” Will said, “if you talk anymore I’ll throw up on you. I mean it. I can’t even argue with you right now.”
“What’s the matter, my friend? You have to eat sometime, to get your energy back. Who’s your daddy, bitch?”
“Damnit, stop. Go away. Just, walk downstairs.”
Martinez laughed and at last Will heard his footsteps descending.
Time passed and Will felt again like he was going to be sick. There was nothing left to come up, but he felt like he might wretch at any moment. The decision to go or just stay put occupied him for minutes. Finally, he decided no matter how painful it was that he should try to make it down again, and rose from the settee. Dizziness overcame him. The very same moment Drew shouted to him from across the wheelhouse.
“Will, we got a real problem,” Drew said, binoculars against his eyes, “one of them binders done come loose on that piece of drilling equipment. I know you sick but I need you to go down and try to get that binder back on it, so it don’t shift down the deck. It’s got to be done, can’t have something that heavy moving around back there. Get Martinez to help you out. I’ll put the boat head on into the seas the best I can, but be careful. Make sure you wear your safety gear. And hold onto the headache rack as you make your way back there. Once you’re back there, the stacks will protect you if a wave comes over.”
The seriousness of the task gave Will the strength to ignore his seasickness for the time being. With difficulty he stumbled downstairs to the lounge, but Martinez was not there. So he descended to the main deck level, but he was not in the galley either. As he turned to walk back up the steps to check Martinez’s room, the boat heaved up a wave with such force that he temporarily lost his balance. He grabbed the guard rail and held on. When the boat crested the wave and began down its backside, it felt to Will as if the boat were in free fall. It came down so hard that he went airborne for just a second.
Concerned the equipment might shift in these seas, Will decided to go ahead out there without Martinez and see what he could do. He donned slicker suit, work vest, and hard hat and stepped outside. Drew had turned on the deck lights, but the halogen was still warming up, providing only a dim glow to see by. Will grabbed the cheater pipe from its place on the host rack and slowly inched his way to the cargo, his free arm hooked around the headache rack. As he passed the midship gate he saw the huge, undulating waves sweeping past. The seas were angry, devoid of compassion, their color gray-green, and twenty feet from the boat faded into darkness. Powerful gusts of wind came randomly and whipped against his slicker, slowing his progress. He found it took all his effort to keep his balance, as the water-logged deck boards were as slick as oil.
At last he reached the equipment. He fought for minutes to hook the loose binder where it needed to be on the chain. When that was accomplished he placed he cheater pipe over the handle and leapt on it with all his weight. It was no good. There was not enough leverage to move it, and Will felt he had no strength past a certain point. He thought of loosening the binder by a few links, but that would leave it as loose as it was now. He needed Martinez.
Will dropped the binder and cheater pipe to the deck and made his way back to the galley. The deck lights were now at full brightness. As he walked past the gate a large swell came over the top of the bulwarks just in front of him, and he had just enough time to throw himself onto the headache rack with both arms and cling to the spar. A rush of seawater hit him in the face and he was underwater for a few seconds. When it passed he gasped for air. He clung to the headache rack a few moments more until he noticed his hard hat had been knocked off by the wave.
He spotted it just as it was going overboard at the gate. He ran forward as fast as possible and pulled the boat hook from its stowage above the overhang, but by the time he returned it was just out of reach. Will flung the twelve-foot length of the hook out into the water in desperation, but had not considered his weakened state. He was not strong enough to balance the long metal pole in the water, as most of its length was extended outside the boat. It lurched abruptly in his arm and he let it go with almost no resistance. The boat hook slipped underneath the water’s surface and he watched the hard hat drift past the stern and fade into the darkness.
Will returned to the galley and saw Martinez there at the table eating some buttered toast.
“Hey man, where you been? I’ve been out there fighting with that fucking binder for the last fifteen minutes. I need your help out there. I just got my ass kicked by a huge fucking wave and lost my goddamn hard hat.”
“Take it easy, my friend,” Martinez said, “why you not wait for me before you go out there? I was in the engine room, checking on the port main. I did not know you needed any help. I would have come.”
“I still need your help,” Will said, “We have to bind the chain around the equipment.”
“Okay, my friend. No problem. Let’s go do it now.”
With their combined strength they finally fastened the chain binder down, although they had to hunt for the cheater pipe which had almost gone overboard as well, since Will left it on the open deck. They went inside and Will changed out of his wet clothes. He had learned to bring a change of dry clothes with him when he came on watch, so he wouldn’t have to enter his room.
Will returned to the wheelhouse and took over driving the boat to let Drew rest. Strangely his seasickness, while not entirely gone, had subsided for the time being. He did not mention to Drew about losing the boat hook. It was stupid, not to mention dangerous, to have gone after it in the first place, but this hard hat had come from his father years ago, when he first went to work offshore.
His father was not a sailor, but a truck driver, and he once had a job at a mining facility where he had to wear that same hard hat. He gave it to Will as a gift when he went to work offshore, and for five years Will had worn it every hitch. He bore a lot of ridicule from the other guys for wearing it, since it did not look like the standard issue, but Will was proud of it in a way and was sorry now that it was gone forever.
#
After the fourth knock on the door with no response, Will banged his head against it in frustration. She would not come. He knocked a few more times with his fist, each knock progressively louder than the last. Then he heard footsteps overhead. Moments later Nathan entered the galley, coffee mug in hand, and immediately locked eyes with Will down the hall. Will nodded to Nathan and walked to the head, as if that was his intention all along. He sat in a stall and listened. The engine room hatch opened. He heard the loud diesel rumble then more footsteps. Ten minutes later he heard the hatch open again. He went to the doorway and peered around into the galley. Nathan was there at the coffee station. He poured a cup then walked upstairs.
When he was sure Nathan was gone he went to the pantry and found a Philips head screwdriver. He went back to the door and knelt in front of it. There at the base was a metal vent about a foot and a half square, held in place with four screws. He removed them one by one as fast as he could. As he removed them he placed the screws on the deck, but in the seas they rolled, so instead he dropped them into his t-shirt pocket. When he took out the last screw the vent popped out with no trouble and Will reached inside and up as far as he could. At last he found the doorknob and opened the door.
The smell of vomit took his breath away. He switched on the light and saw it was all over the deck. Justina lay in her bunk with her hands clenched to her chest. She looked bad. Will took off his boots and socks and found some old towels in the head. It was not easy to clean up the mess with the boat constantly heaving, but he did the best he could. He had to fight against gravity pushing and pulling him in every direction. Not to mention the foul smell made him queasy, and he felt his seasickness returning. He felt weak again. He had not even considered throughout the day when he was incapacitated that Justina might be more susceptible to motion sickness than anyone on board.
“Justina,” Will said, “I’m here now.”
He emptied the can of Lysol all over the room, but it did not take away the stench, only added a fragrance of cheap flowers on top. He went out and made a small bucket of mop water and scrubbed the deck. He felt himself on the verge of being sick. The up and down motion of the boat made it dangerous to even walk, let alone do something like this. One time the propped door came loose and swung open hard, nearly striking Will in the head.
As the final step he pulled the sheets from her bunk while she lay there. She resisted him and waved him away, but he managed to pull them out from under her with only a little difficulty. He piled the dirty towels and sheets in the washing machine, but did start the machine. Hurrying back through the galley Will snagged a bottled water and an unopened box of saltine crackers. He also grabbed a new can of Lysol.
Will knew the absolute best way to treat seasickness is to get the person to a place where they can see the horizon. This gives the mind a fixed reference point in which to re-establish equilibrium. The worst place is to be locked inside a room with no windows, where you can feel the movement of the vessel but not see it. It was better his room was on the lowermost deck, since there is more sway the higher up you go. His room was near the bow and that was not the best. It was better to be nearer midship. The absolute best place to be was in the engine room, since it sits below the surface of the water. It is hot down there though, which is not good for the queasiness.
“Make it stop moving,” she said.
“I can’t do that.”
“Make it stop. I can’t stand it.”
He knelt beside her bunk, took her by the arms, and rolled her towards him in order to give her some Dramamine. It was a long shot since the pill doesn’t typically work after you’re already sick, but he thought he should try everything. Her back was to him and when she felt his arms grip her, she suddenly came to life and thrashed about. Her elbow knocked Will square on the chin. She screamed aloud. She gasped and wretched in his arms, but there was nothing to come out. Will saw her bloodshot eyes and moist cheeks. He held her until he was sure she wouldn’t thrash about anymore. Then he put his fingers to her lips to remind her not to make noise, although there was not much risk. He was sure every man not on watch was in his bunk, either fighting off his own seasickness or resting. Nathan would come down every hour or so to perform and engine room check, but that was it. Still, he did not like it when she screamed that way. She had never seemed violent before, but now it could see it was in her.
Justina leaned up in the bunk because it was difficult to sip from the bottle lying flat. He handed her the small blue capsule, and she swallowed it down. Everything seemed okay, but a minute later she wretched again and vomited out the water along with the half-dissolved pill. Every time she heaved her breathing became more labored. Her eyes were shut. She needed good rest more than anything. Will picked up the pill and tried to get her to swallow it again. She would not. She pursed her lips and cried. He opened the box of saltines and gave her a few. It is not good to have an empty stomach when seasick. You want something dry in there, at least, a slice of bread or crackers, but nothing greasy or acidic. She ate a couple of them, but could not keep them down either. She spit them up all over her shirt, along with the water she drank them with. At this point tears fell from her face. Will wanted her to keep quiet, but she was not listening to him. He put his hand over her mouth when she became particularly loud, but she only yelled louder and pushed his hand away.
There was nothing he could do. As he knew, you cannot help anyone else in their own seasickness. It’s something you have to suffer alone. He left her, switched off the lights, and collapsed into the empty bunk, still in his work clothes. His exhaustion had caught up with him, and although he could not sleep, he went somewhere halfway between sleep and wakefulness and remained there until morning.



November 12
For the next six days it was dark skies, pounding sheets of rain, and violent seas. The storm battered the Etowah without mercy. After three days of no communication with the outside world they finally received a weather transmission which provided a name for their suffering – tropical storm Paloma. There had been reports of a storm formation in the Atlantic before they left Cameron, but at that time it was projected to move in the opposite direction. At some point, however, the storm had altered course and with relative speed approached Mexico, where it then slowed to a crawl, ever-increasing in strength.
Whenever the seas broke over the bow and the vessel bogged down under that enormous weight of water, it sent the fear through each man that she might not break the surface again. Drew, still in a leadership role from the absence of Captain Frank, at last decided to take the vessel of its plotted course into shallower waters, near the coastline of the Cayman Islands off the Dominican Republic. The weather there held at fifteen to twenty foot seas for days, with wind gusts up to sixty miles per hour, just under hurricane conditions. This was not ideal, but it was tolerable. Drew debated whether to go even closer to one of the islands and drop anchor to ride out the storm, but instead he decided to just pull the engines back and make at least a little headway for the duration.
There were a couple of crises where the hands had to brave the weather and secure something on deck, but mostly they kept in the wheelhouse during watch and in their rooms while off watch. One eventful thing happened two days ago: Nathan saw Captain Frank in the galley making a sandwich. He filled him in on the current situation, but said Frank was not interested at all and did not look well either. Drew asked Nathan the next time he saw him to tell him please come to the wheelhouse and talk to him. 
Drew had finally gotten a full night of rest, not sleep, only because Jesse held the watch one night and allowed him to lie in his own bunk rather than the settee. Jesse told the crew he planned to write up a report on Frank’s lack of responsibility when they got back to the States. Martinez said he would write one too.
All of them became seasick at one time or another. Will got over his own by the second day and was fine after that. Justina’s condition, however, had not improved. In the last day it had even worsened to the point where Will debated going to the crew. She was extremely weak and pale and breathed in gasps. It often sounded like she was smothering. When she spoke it was in whispers and even her moans came out in short, quiet breaths. He had given up feeding. Every liquid he gave her came back up immediately. He tried various ways of getting her to at least swallow water. He tried a straw, but that did not work since she was too weak to sit up. He then tried a torn piece of sponge soaked in water. That worked the best, and the times when she was coherent she sucked it dry like a baby, although she could never keep it down for long. This had gone on for days. He still kept the door locked while on watch, but had the vent screws loosened so he could enter in a hurry. She was now in no state to open it for him. She had not even gotten out of her bunk in days. Will found her sheets were soiled and he had seen spots of blood. He changed them the best he could, but did not want to change her clothes. Having to do that would mean things were far more serious than he was yet willing to admit.
He hoped each day when he went to check on her that she would be feeling better and give him a smile. Then things could go back to normal until they reached Trinidad. So far this had not happened, but the seas were calming down all the time.
#
Today the skies were blue and clear, and as if the morale of the crew was directly related to the weather, they also were in brighter moods. The joking and storytelling returned. It was an exciting time. They were well on the final leg of the voyage. Already they had seen patches of oil platforms and rigs. The exoticness of these platforms added to their excitement. They did not resemble the rigs off the coast of Louisiana, some were the size of two city blocks. In just a few more days they would reach their destination in Port Lisas. Nathan talked about the possibility of renting a car to explore the island if the boat were to be there a few days. Drew thought it was unlikely but told him they would see how it went.
Everyone was in a better mood, that is, except for Will. He spent an increasing amount of his time on watch, coming up with excuses to go downstairs, so he could check on Justina. For this reason his sanitary duties and other responsibilities continued to decline. Drew was not happy. This had caused considerable tension between them and they sat for hours together in the wheelhouse not speaking.
Drew propped open both wheelhouse doors and a steady breeze filled the room with fresh air. The weather outside was warmer than in the States by at least fifteen degrees. Both he and Will wore short-sleeve work shirts. On the radio there was intermittent static from far away vessels making passing arrangements, spoken in English but with foreign accents.
“Can you die from seasickness?” Will asked.
“You sick?”
“No.”
“You might want to die, but you won’t.”
“But what about those slave ships that crossed the Atlantic two hundred years ago. I remember I saw a documentary where they died from seasickness by the hundreds.”
“That ain’t so,” Drew said, “they had seasickness, but they didn’t die from that. Most of them died of dehydration caused by the seasickness, and I think dysentery, but there were also illnesses spread from being crammed in close quarters like they were. You got figure that. There was lots of reasons. But they didn’t die from only being seasick. You don’t got nothing to worry about.”
“But what if it could? I mean, what would happen if one of us got sick and couldn’t be any water down, over days and days out here?”
“Well, we could head to port on one of them islands and take you to the hospital. Or, if we were close to a platform, we could take you there and have the medic on hand take a look. Or, if it came down to it, we could call the Coast Guard and have them arrange a helicopter to fly out. They can make arrangements with other countries to help out, say we’re out here. They’s plenty of options. Like I say, you don’t have nothing to worry about. Not out here. Why you asking all these questions all of a sudden?”
“You know how your mind gets.”
Another half hour went by without a word spoken. Several times Will attempted to break the awkwardness, but whenever he tried to start a conversation, Drew came back with one-word responses which made it difficult to keep up. In the silence Will thought up many non-suspicious excuses he could use to go down and check on her again. It had been more than an hour now. There were only so many reasons to go downstairs, after all. 
Soon an opportunity presented itself without his interference. An engine room alarm went off, its shrill beep startled both Will and Drew. By reflex Will went to the alarm panel and hit the acknowledgement button.
“Which alarm was it?” Drew asked.
“Port main.”
“Fuck, man. You know, it’s gonna be embarrassing if both engines go out and we got to be towed into port like a damn trash barge. That would be some grand entrance, boy.”
Drew leaned over the tachometers next to the compass. He tapped the port meter and then pulled back on the chrome lever to disengage the engine.
“For sure,” Drew said, “Dead as dead can be. Run tell Martinez. And knock on Jesse’s door on your way down. I think they had a plan for the next time it happened. Help them out if they need you.”
“Roger roger.”
Will descended and knocked on Jesse’s door. It was locked, so he had to shout through the door. He finally heard Jesse’s muffled response and continued downstairs where he found Martinez outside on the galley door steps, staring out at the water.
“My friend,” Will said.
“What you need?”
“Port main went out again.”
“Okay, my friend,” Martinez said, “I thought I heard. Can you go tell Jesse to meet me in the engine room?”
“I told him already. He’s up.”
“Good, okay.”
“Do you need me down there?”
“That would be good, if you want to help. It’s gonna take awhile.”
“Okay,” Will said, “I’ll be down in a little bit.”
“Okay, my friend.”
Will took his time and cleaned some leftover dirty dishes in the sink and waited until both Martinez and Jesse had descended to the engine room. Then he went straight to his room. Kneeling, he carefully removed the vent and opened the door.
Once inside, he soaked a piece of sponge and moistened Justina’s lips. She came to life when the wetness touched her lips and puckered instinctively as if drinking from an imaginary cup. For a moment she leaned upright, but fell back again with no energy. Once the water touched her throat she gasped, unable to swallow it. It dribbled down her mouth and soaked the pillow. This had happened before. Will felt her forehead with the back of her hand. She was unnaturally warm. He then repeated this same process for fifteen minutes, patiently, and without success. In the meantime he talked aloud because it distracted her when he spoke, and he hoped it would make the liquid go down easier if she wasn’t concentrating so much on it. He tried to talk about good things, things to lift her spirit.
“So I thought we should go over the plan for once we reach Trinidad. I wrote it down on the pad, but I know it by heart. I think we should go over it a few times, so we can be on the same page and know what to do in case something goes wrong, not that it will. We are only two days away.”
She gripped his arm and faintly smiled. Then she whispered something but he could not make it out.
“Once we get there,” he continued, “we will probably tie up alongside some dock. By then you ought to be feeling better. The storm is passing. Have you noticed? It’s been calming all day. We will pack your things the night before and have it ready to go at a moment’s notice. I will pack you some lunch to carry with you in a bag. And yes, I’ll put in some Doritos. I know what you like. Then, that night when everyone else has gone to bed, and before Nathan wakes up, I’ll double-check the dock and take you outside. All we got to do is get you outside. Once you are there we can play off anything like you just walked on board, or something. Then nobody will ever know you came down with us. Then you can catch a ride to your house. Simple as that.”
“Papa,” Justina said.
“That’s right. You got get feeling better so you can see him.”
“I miss my papa.”
After this she closed her eyes and went to sleep. Her breathing was labored. Each breath came out rough and mechanical, like a machine. He left her a bottled water and a few pieces of bread he had brought in case she became hungry, then walked out, replacing the vent on the door. He called Drew on the phone and told him he was going down to help Martinez and Jesse in the engine room. He put in some ear plugs, opened the hatch, and went down.
The engine room of the Etowah was the least well-kept area of the boat. Will walked along the companionway, a long corridor which leads to the engine room proper. In relation to the rest of the boat, the engine room is located below the main deck, so Will was headed towards the stern of the vessel. Along the overhead was a multitude of pipes and wires all crammed together. His work boots clanged across the metal grating. Dark, oily water sloshed in the bilge compartments below the grating. The bulkhead of the engine room was a dingy yellow color, once white, but stained through years of neglect. Overall it was a depressing place to be, and so loud while underway that you could barely hear someone yelling directly into your ear.
At the end of the companionway was a hatch which opened into a large space where all the engines and pump on the vessel were located. Closest to the companionway entrance were the pump engines for the fuel and product tanks. The fuel pump was yellow. The bulk pumps were gray. The liquid mud pump was brown. In the center of the engine room were the main engines, port and starboard, which turned a single propeller each. They were gigantic blocks of metal about the size of a pickup truck. Between the main engines were the generators, two of them, smaller than the main engines but still large. In front of the generators was the fuse panel, a high cabinet with many switches. A sticker on the front read: Danger High Voltage.
Will entered the engine room and saw Jesse and Martinez next to the port engine, fighting with a monkey wrench. They both gripped its handled and were pulling back with all their strength. Finally it broke free and they staggered backwards. They did not notice Will until he waved in their faces. Jesse nodded to him, and then yelled something into his ear. Will had to remove one earplug to understand.
From what he could make out a tool they needed had fallen into the bilge. The bilge compartment underneath the main engines was filled with a black sludge about the consistency of mud. Will did not feel entirely safe crawling down there and reaching into it, since there were likely all sorts of harmful chemicals in it. Jesse pointed to where he thought it might be, so Will reluctantly lifted up the grating and climbed down into the compartment. It was hard to maneuver in that small space. He first tried to reach the area without changing his upright position, but finally he had to get onto his belly and crawl underneath the area directly below the engine. It must have been a hundred degrees under there the way the sweat poured from his face. Once he was in the right position he could reach in with ease. He pushed up his right sleeve and fished in the muck with the entire length of his arm. After a minute he found a screwdriver, but that was not the lost tool, according to Jesse’s nod. About to give up, Will reached into a corner of a small area off the main compartment. There he found the tool, just a normal wrench. He showed it to Jesse, who nodded and clapped Will on the back with a smile.
Will held up his arm, covered in the black slime. Martinez gestured like he was snapping a twig in two – break time. Will need to clean himself anyway. Jesse handed him a rag to wipe off the excess, so it would not drip all over the galley deck. Then Martinez and Will walked out of the engine room. Jesse stayed behind to clean up the wrench and to continue on the task at hand.
Now above, Martinez followed Will outside the galley door to the outside sink. Will pulled out the orange tub of abrasive cleaner with his clean arm and pumped out a few dollops. He scrubbed up and down the length of his arm.
Martinez said, “Will, why you reach down there to get that wrench for Jesse?”
“He asked me to.”
“Jesse has another wrench. He don’t need that one. We must have twenty wrenches down there. It was not right for him to make you reach in there for only a wrench. Those chemicals is bad for your skin. He just fucking with you. You should have told him to go fuck himself. If he want that wrench so bad he can climb down there and get it for himself.”
“But he’s the engineer,” Will said, “How was I supposed to know it was only a wrench?”
“I don’t know, my friend,” Martinez admitted, “But now I hope your arm don’t fall off.”
“Me neither.”
“I’m going to have a Coke. You want one too?”
Will shook his head no.
“Then we have to go back down and work on the engine some more. It’s going to take some time. Pain in the ass. Good thing we have the part we need to fix it. Otherwise what we do? We not in the US. There’s no stores out here.”
“Surely they have something like that in Trinidad. I mean, there’s boats that work out of there too.”
“Maybe,” Martinez said, “I don’t know. Not for sure they would have what we need.”
Will scrubbed for a few minutes more until his arm was mostly clean again. He thought about what Martinez had said about his arm falling off, and although he knew Martinez was joking, he looked it over closely for any signs of damage or peeling. He found nothing. Afterwards, he called Drew on the phone to see if he needed a break. Drew said he didn’t and asked what the progress was. Will told him they hadn’t even started.
“What? Tell them boys to get to work. Be sure and check up on me again soon cause I just had something to drink and am liable to need a piss break here shortly.”
“Yeah, okay.” Will hung up.
Martinez stood in the galley, against the counter, downing the last drops of Coke. Will waited with him until Martinez was ready to go back down. Then, at the last minute, Will said he forgot to relieve Drew, and told Martinez he’d be down in ten minutes or so. Martinez said for him to come down as soon as possible because it was really a three-man job.
After the engine room hatch closed, Will went directly to his room to check on her. He flipped the light switch next to the door and the bulb flashed bright and went out.
“Fuck, man.”
He knew it would take at least fifteen minutes to change the bulb the way it was housed, having to bring in the ladder and balancing in these seas, so instead he just grabbed the small flashlight he kept beside his bunk and went to her. Accidently he shone the light in her face, and she winced, but did not move. Her eyes were opened wide. She looked frightened, almost as if she didn’t know where she was. Will positioned the flashlight between the mattress and the bulkhead, so that its beam fell on the bunk wall, providing a dim ambient light to see by. Once again he took the bottled water and the sponge and tried to get her to drink.
He remembered the conversation he had with Drew earlier. He had been afraid all along that she might dehydrate, and had known instinctively that was the thing to fear. Will had always heard that a person couldn’t live more than a few days without water, but it had been nearly a week now. He could not call Justina’s condition good, but at least she was making it. He supposed he had given her enough water over the last few days. He didn’t know.
Justina took the sponge in her mouth greedily and sucked it dry. But then she must have swallowed it, because she began to cough uncontrollably. Will panicked. He hit her on the back a few times. She kept breathing in, but could not exhale. Without thinking Will opened her mouth by force and reached inside. He found the sponge and pulled it out, covered in saliva. It frightened him more that she had not resisted at all with his hand down her throat. When the sponge was out she collapsed onto the pillow and lay there, breathing hard. She appeared unconscious.
Will placed his head in both hands. He then lashed out and struck the side of the bunk bed as hard as he could. She did not stir. He felt even more furious now that he was in physical pain. He felt like he needed to stay here with her. It was clear to anybody that she needed a real doctor by this point. But right at the moment those guys were also expecting him down there. If he didn’t go in a couple minutes, he was sure Martinez would come looking for him. The door was unlocked and the vent was off.
Will rose and whispered to Justina that he would return soon. He went out again, locking the door and replacing the vent, but in his fury he forgot to turn off the flashlight and within a few minutes it dimmed and went out completely.
When Will returned to the engine room he was distracted and did not immediately find Jesse and Martinez to help them. Instead he walked to the fire station and leaned against the hose rack. Jesse happened to see him there while he and Martinez struggled lifting a heavy piece off the engine. He picked up a rag and threw it in Will’s direction. Will walked over and helped them set the piece down onto the deck. Once more, as usual, Will became useless, and when he tried to kneel to help them diagnose the problem Jesse brushed him away, so he just stood back again and waited until they needed his strength.
Standing there, he imagined how each of them might react if he told them about her. By this point he had made up his mind. The first chance he got he was going to confess everything to Captain Frank and try to get Justina some help. If he lost his job over it or got thrown in jail, it didn’t matter. Going directly to Frank seemed the best way to approach it. Knowing him, he would understand where the others would not. It eased his mind to have made the decision. The only thing he wished were different now was that he ought to have done it days ago. Once the crew knew everything, and especially coming from the captain, they would all work together and make her well. Get her safely off the boat. In the end they would forgive him and not tell the Coast Guard or the company. He was sure of that.
Eventually they got the piece of machinery loose and set it up on the workbench. Jesse got out his small grinder and shaved off a metal hose to be replaced. Will had no idea what was going on. He felt stupid and anxious just standing there like an idiot, waiting for them to tell him what to do. Martinez had another piece, the new piece to replace the bad one. He was working with it. Altogether they worked down there for two hours. Will stood by most of that time. Occasionally they would get him to run up top and fetch a tool. Only then did he have a chance to look in on Justina. Other times he was simply needed to hold a pipe in place or help lift something while it was bolted on.
His mind on the other hand was busy being consumed with all the variations of scenarios and possible outcomes from confessing her presence to the crew. There is something about being in an extremely loud environment and wearing ear plugs that isolates you even though there may be others there.
The first obstacle would be to knock on Captain Frank’s door and get him to actually come out of his room. It would be necessary that no one else was around to hear, since Will would have to shout everything through the door. Frank would not answer immediately, but he would be listening. He would then carefully explain the entire circumstance, from the beginning, and not lie. Then he would tell Frank he needed help, that it had become more than he could handle alone. He would say it so that Frank could not ignore him, and from that point on the responsibility would be taken from his shoulders and shared. Frank would come out of his room. He would not be happy with Will, maybe forever, but he would know what to do next. He would want to see Justina and maybe then he would gather the crew to tell them. Then they would radio for a helicopter to come and fly her to a hospital. Or maybe Frank knew what she needed and they would just tend to her on the Etowah until they reached Trinidad.
It got to the point where he couldn’t wait any longer. He started pacing back and forth over the deck plates. Jesse and Martinez noticed him and exchanged glances. Soon Will remembered Drew said he might need a break soon. That had been at least two and a half hours ago. He tapped on Martinez’s shoulder and gestured that he was going up.
He found Drew smoking a cigarette and listening to music on the CD player. Drew was glad to be relieved at last and went down to take a piss break and get a snack. Will decided in the meantime that when Drew returned, that would be the time to go down and knock on Frank’s door. No one else would be around. Having made his decision liberated him from the dread of the last week and for the first time in days he looked at his surroundings.
It had been a clear day apart from a few small wisps of clouds in the sky. The swells held steady at five to seven feet, but that seemed minor considering how rough it had been in the days passed. Will gazed out at the horizon. Platforms and rigs dotted the landscape at various distances. Drew had the doors propped open and Will breathed in the air. It felt crisp and clean in his lungs. He wondered if there was less pollution in this part of the world. It seemed that way. The sea itself was a deep blue. The sun was low on the horizon and the instruments in front of him cast long shadows to the East. Will took it all in and tried to feel inspired by the day’s beauty, but was left unmoved. To him it looked like all the other days he had ever seen.
In a few minutes Drew returned. He carried with him a can of V8 and an apple.
“All right, sir,” Drew began, “you are relieved. You guys about done down there? That autopilot don’t want to work right without both engines, and I’m about sick of steering this bitch.”
“I have no idea,” Will replied, “They look about done. But I don’t know what the fuck they’re even doing. Might be hours. I can go ask and report back to you.”
“Sounds good. When you’re done helping them guys I need you to come up here. You gonna be driving the boat tonight while I lay on that there settee and get some sleep. I didn’t get hardly none last night.”
“Don’t want me to do my sanitary first? I figured I might do it later this afternoon.”
“You ain’t done it yet?”
“I been helping them guys all afternoon.”
“I guess it look all right down there,” Drew said, “Just make sure the trash it taken out, then come up here.”
“Roger roger.”
Will stood a moment beside Drew in the chair. Drew opened the V8 and took a drink. Then he adjusted the distance on the radar.
“Hey Drew.”
“What you need?”
“Look,” Will began, “I wanted to apologize for how I’ve been. I know I’ve been more of a fuckup than usual. I’m trying to do better.”
“It ain’t no thing, Willy D. We all got stressed when that storm front moved in, and you was already stressed from being on the boat for so long. Don’t worry about it. Just keep that damn galley clean and I’ll be happy. No need to apologize.”
“Thanks, man.”
“No problem.”
Will left Drew and went down the steps to the next level. There he stood in the lounge for a long time, his eyes absently moving from object to object, coffee table to bookshelf to Nathan’s winter coat hung on the closet door. It was dim, but he did not turn on the lights. He ran his fingers along the bookshelf. He sat on the couch then got up a moment later. He did everything in fact except walk down the hallway to the captain’s door and knock on it. Finally, he settled into a routine where he watched the clock on the wall, waiting in five minute increments. As the minute hand approached each number he decided that was the time he’d go knock on Frank’s door. Then, that time would come and he would not go. Then it became the next number, and so on, until it was almost five forty five. As the minute hand reached the nine, at last Will rose from the couch and went down the hall. He did not walk slower or faster than normal. In fact he took a lot of care to walk at a normal pace. He reached the door and paused. He admired the placard on the door, its tarnished bronze a good candidate for some idle-time polishing, whenever that time would come again. He banged on the door hard with one fist. His knocks thudded against the solid wood. He put his face next to the door and spoke in a voice much louder than his normal voice,
“Captain, this is Will. I need to talk to you about something important. I need your help. Please. Can you open the door and listen to me for a minute?”
Will heard the captain stir in the room but the door did not open. He stood there for two minutes waiting patiently, and without saying anything else. He then knocked again, this time even louder than before. He turned the knob on the door but it was locked.
“Frank,” Will said, “I know you don’t want to talk to nobody. I understand that. I wouldn’t want to either if I was in your shoes. But this is serious. I know you can hear me. Please.”
Will hesitated.
“There is a girl on board who is sick. I brought her along with us. I made a mistake and hid her in my room. She’s been here with us the whole way down. All she wanted was a ride. That’s all. I figured, what’s the harm in that? But I know I should have said something. I know it was wrong.”
Frank never came to the door. Will was positive he heard him inside. He stood at the door for five minutes longer before turning away. Then, as if nothing was wrong, he went downstairs.
He checked on Justina once more. Since his own flashlight had burned out, Will took one of the boat’s flashlights into the room with him. He knew this time not to shine the light into her eyes, but overhead. He knelt at her bunk. She was not conscious. Her breathing was weak and mechanical, almost as if one of the pumps in the engine room was breathing for her. He brushed the hair out of her face, and then wet her lips with the sponge. Her eyes opened slightly, but Will did not think she saw him. She tried to speak but seemed too weak to vocalize her thoughts. Again she puckered her lips as if wanting water. Will put the sponge to her mouth and she sucked on it until it was dry. It was good she was able to do that. It gave him hope. She did not spit up like she normally did. Soon the sponge was dry and he soaked it again in the water. She soon had that one dry too. Her eyes opened wider. She stared at him.
“Hey,” Will whispered, “you’re awake. Hey can you hear me? How do you feel? Is there anything I can do for you?”
She did not answer, but looked at Will as if in expectation of something. He did not know what. This was the first time she had been responsive in days.
“Well, look,” Will said, “I think you’re doing better, but you got to drink more. And then maybe tonight eat some soup. But you got to drink.”
There was silence in the room. Will did not speak. She only looked at him. He attempted a few more times to soak the sponge for her, but she refused. Finally he rose, but when he did she reached out and grabbed his arm. He sat again beside her. She looked weak, pale. He felt uncomfortable just sitting there.
“Justina, please get better,” he said, “I don’t want this.”
#
It was now evening and Will sat at the helm. The Etowah rocked gently from side to side. The seas had lain down considerably since morning. The stars and moon in the night sky were clear, yet along the horizon a deep haze obscured whatever lay ahead. It was dark in the wheelhouse, but Will’s profile was illuminated by the radar screens. On the radar were dense groups of green dots scattered within the circumference range. He had set its range to sixteen miles. These groups of dots indicated oil field platforms and rigs, and were sometimes referred to as rabbit patches since they resembled patches of lettuce on the screen. Will watched the radar screen and observed some close platforms with the binoculars. Their regular blinking lights disrupted the haze all around. He found the autopilot control panel in the dark and corrected course to starboard by five degrees, then watched as the blinking lights in front of the boat slowly veered to port. These platforms were at least eight miles away, yet Will liked to keep well clear beforehand.
Drew lay on the settee beside the chart table, covered up with an old blanket. He had been asleep for more than an hour. Will had tried to avoid this scenario, as he was still anxious about Justina’s condition and wanted the opportunity to check up on her. Drew had not had much sleep and lay down as soon as Will was back in the wheelhouse, after a late dinner of pasta and baked chicken breast.
Jesse and Martinez had at last repaired the port main, and it was back online, after replacing the fuel filters and the fuel pump. Will had managed to check on Justina during this time often enough. She had continued to take the sponge soaked with water all afternoon without heaving, although she still didn’t have the strength or awareness to do it by herself. But now it had been a few hours since he had last checked on her and was becoming nervous. After his attempt to tell Captain Frank about Justina failed, and since she seemed to be doing better, Will decided he would wait it out another day to see what happens. By then they would be even closer to land.
Another thirty minutes went by, Will waiting for Drew to stir so he could ask to go down for a break. Drew’s snoring, however, had only increased and Will was convinced he was more asleep now than he had been. But he was also convinced that Justina needed him in her weakened state.
He picked up the binoculars and gave the horizon another sweep. The haze had somewhat dissipated. It was causing ghost patterns to appear on the radar screen. On their present course there were no platforms for miles, and even if the boat were to veer off course, it would take almost an hour to reach the nearest platform. Still, to be cautious, he again corrected course to a heading which was even freer from obstacles. This put them at least fifteen degrees off the waypoint course, but he now felt confident to go downstairs and check on her, as well as grab a late-night snack.
He pulled off his work boots and as quietly as possible set them on the deck beside the helm chair. Wearing only socks on his feet he made no sound as he descended the stairs past Drew, still asleep on the settee. As he walked through the lounge he saw Martinez asleep on the couch while an action movie played at low volume on the TV. He stopped in the galley and pulled a V8 from the walk-in. He opened the cabinet and pulled out a Nutty Bar. He set them both on the galley table so he could grab them quickly on the way back to the wheelhouse.
It was quiet in his room. He knew upon entering that something was not right. He quickly replaced the vent cover and locked the door. He found the flashlight next to the door and shined it in the direction of Justina’s bunk. She was there, her eyes open.
Will did not react the way he had anticipated he would. Over the last days he had imagined the multitude of ways it might happen, but now that it had he did not react according to his premeditations. It was the stillness of her body and eyes that shook him. All his planning had not prepared him for that. He approached the bunk but did not kneel. He placed the flashlight between the mattress and bulkhead so to throw light overhead. It chilled him when he accidently shone the light into her eyes and she did not react like she had earlier that day. Now that it had happened he admitted to himself that he had known all along that it was going to happen. From the first days of her seasickness, when she began to look like that, he knew it even then.
He felt sharp pangs of guilt that he knew he would feel for the rest of his life. But perhaps it would not be that way. He had tried after all. He had attempted to inform the captain. Maybe he should have said something sooner, but what would they have done? They would have done just the same and she would be dead the same. It was funny. It had seemed to Will his whole life before this moment that a person was in control of his life, and to a degree, his surroundings. That was a delusion. He saw his own life and actions as if from the outside looking in. What was he doing here, hundreds of miles away from home, on a boat? For that matter, why were any of them here? To make a bit of money? To fill their bellies? Suddenly the absolute silliness of it all made him want to laugh. All the effort and time and heavy machinery and equipment and training, what was it all for? It seemed so absurd and stupid he wanted to laugh, although he didn’t. This was all true and yet here he was, and now look what has happened. He had not intended this. He had not wanted it to happen this way. Who even wants a sixteen hundred ton boat made of iron? Why does it exist? Why did somebody break his back inside a mine to harvest the iron they used to build it? Will saw his life and the lives of all those responsible that had led to this exact moment, lined up in a row. They were all guilty. They were all responsible for her. Not just him. The miner too. He was as accountable as Will. He sat there beside her body and contemplated for what seemed an eternity about such things.
But then the bow thruster fired up and frightened him out of his stupor. He remembered he had left the helm and leapt to his feet. He flew out of the room, and from the corner of his eye he saw the Nutty Bar and V8 still on the galley table. As he ran up the stairs Will felt the boat heave hard to starboard. He had to grab both rails to avoid falling. He heard the main engines roar. The bow thruster screamed and vibrated the entire cabin. In the midst of all the chaos, Will heard a familiar low, intermittent tone coming from outside the boat. In the lounge he saw the action film was still playing, but Martinez was not there. He ran up the steps into the wheelhouse as fast as he could.
Outside the windows was an oil platform, so close it looked as if it were just an extension of the vessel. The Etowah’s spotlight shone directly on it, illuminating only a small portion of its massive structure. A loose metal sign on the side read: BI-108. Will noticed they could only see the vertical supports of the platform, and that a much larger section was above the cabin. Now he understood where the intermittent tone came from. He arrived just in time to see the bow of the Etowah scrape alongside it. The iron groaned and popped. It was only then Will noticed he stood next to the rest of the crew.
They were all up there, including Captain Frank, who stood at the bow thruster controls. Drew stood at the helm, his head crooked forward so he could see out the window to the top of the platform. Martinez and Nathan stood out on the wheelhouse deck, watching the hull scrape against the platform’s base. Jesse stood at a side window, just looking out. Time did not seem to move forward for minutes, but soon the Etowah separated from the platform and slowly passed by in silence. Now there were yells and commands, but Will did not make out anything specific. He felt like a hillside observer at a safe distance from the battle. Before he knew it there was silence in the wheelhouse. Everyone was now inside, the doors shut. He heard Frank speaking to him and came back from where he was.
“You just endangered the life of every man on board this vessel. You get the goddamn hell out of my wheelhouse.”
“Captain.”
“Get out of my sight!”
No one looked in his direction and no one said anything else to him. The Etowah was well clear of the platform now. He looked back and saw that it was unlit. Its low tone grew softer and softer the further away they sailed. The spotlight was still on and Will followed its beam to the water. The waters rippled and undulated as always. Finally he descended the stairs. His descent made no sound as his boots sat next to the helm.
Downstairs, Will saw the V8 and Nutty Bar still on the galley table and sat down. He unwrapped the plastic and took a bite, but it had no taste. He then peeled open the top of the V8 and took a drink of it. By now it was warm and not very good. Will felt both engines throttle to full speed again. The Etowah yawed hard over to port then corrected itself after a few bobs. Will grabbed the table instinctively for balance. They were underway.
He thought to call upstairs to remind them to shut down the bow thruster, but he did not move from the seat. He took a few more bites and another drink. After a few minutes the bow thruster shut down. Now, without the background rumble of the bow thruster, the galley was uncomfortably still. Will felt immediately as if he should not be there. He finished the snack and threw the trash into the garbage.
Next he went to the head down the hallway. As he passed the door to his room he did not look at it. In the head he washed his face and hands and did not look into the mirror. He dried his hands and wiped his face on a dirty towel which hung there. Back in the galley Will went directly to the pantry and pulled out a small step ladder, which was stowed behind a small refrigerator. He also took a pack of light bulbs from the shelf and carried them both to his room.
The door was unlocked and swung open when he knocked it with the ladder. It banged hard against the wall. He knew she was there, but did not look in the direction of her bunk. His attention was now squarely on replacing the blown light bulb. It was dark, so Will took a gallon of water he kept in the corner and propped the door open. It was possible someone might come down at any time, but he was not concerned. All that mattered was that he replace the light bulb. Now that he could see, he flipped off the light switch and put up the ladder in the center of the room. He climbed to the uppermost step. The sway of the boat made it more difficult to balance than usual, but as long as there were no lurches like a few minutes ago, he would be fine. With one hand he loosened the small screws holding the glass dome, and had the other just underneath the dome to catch it when it fell. The dome fell as expected and he caught it. He climbed down and set the dome upside down on the empty bunk. Then he opened the pack of bulbs, took one out, and ascended the ladder again. He unscrewed the old bulb and shook it. Sure enough the element was blown. He tossed it onto the bunk from where he was. By accident it hit the edge of the dome and shattered. Will did not curse or become angry with himself. He screwed in the new bulb and climbed down. He flipped the switch and the light came on. It shone very bright without the dome as a diffuser. Instead of replacing the dome, however, Will used it to sweep the broken glass into. Finally, it seemed he would never get all the shards up so he pulled off the sheet and threw it in the trashcan and set the dome onto the bare mattress.
Now that the light was replaced, Will closed the door to his room and sat down on the empty bunk, facing her. She was there but he could not bear to look. He rose and pulled the sheet over her body. Then he sat back on the bunk and leaned against the wall. It was impossible to know how long it was, but the entire time he did not think about anything at all. He did not think about the boat or the girl or himself.
#
Will awoke at last and the reality of the situation came back to him. He felt this reality in the pit of his stomach, an unbearable sensation of owning something he did not want. He rose and found the watch he kept next to his bunk. It was past three in the morning. Will went to the galley and nobody was around. He went to the cabinet underneath the sink and pulled out a few large trash bags. He then went to the pantry and got a roll of duct tape. Back in the room he opened a bag and went to her body. She was cold to the touch. Will shut her eyes. He pulled off the sheets and tried to put the first bag over her feet and legs, but it was no good. The idea of putting her body into a garbage bag sickened him. He flung the bag across the room in disgust, his hands shaking. He replaced the sheet over her body and silently rose. He went to the locker and pulled out two old blankets. He used those instead to wrap her body in a kind of cocoon, held together by the duct tape. Will worked at this as he had worked at replacing the light bulb, calmly and with patience. When the job was done he sat on the deck beside her bunk.
Eventually he rose again and went to the galley. He looked at the clock and it was now four thirty. He switched off the lights in the galley and went back to his room and lifted Justina’s body off the bunk. She was much lighter than he thought she would be. There was no difficulty as he made his way through the galley. There was a fear in the back of his mind that someone would walk downstairs, but no one did. The biggest problem was opening the galley door and lifting her over the steps, but soon it was done and he was on the back deck.
The air and seas were calm. The temperature was not cold or cool or warm or hot. It was just mild. The sky seemed unnaturally dark, there was no moon he could see by, but just along the horizon line was a faint band of light, slowly overtaking the night sky. The stars were bright and he could not help but to stare up at them. It was utterly dark on the deck and Will found his way to the gate by memory. He brought Justina’s body to the starboard side since it was calmer there. The seas had lain down considerably in the night. The only sounds were the soft rush of water going by and the dull engines roaring at full speed ahead. He positioned her body in such a way that her feet were over the side and without hesitation rolled her body overboard. It was easier than he thought it would be. Because the boat was making way at about twelve knots he could not follow her for very long. What he noticed with some apprehension was that her body did not sink immediately into the water. He had forgotten to weigh it down. A chill ran through him and he panicked briefly, but it soon passed. There was nothing that could happen now. It was over.
The light on the horizon had grown to overtake half the sky. It glowed pink and orange and faded into the darkness to the West. It was beautiful to see, but Will did not feel the beauty of it or of anything. He rose and went into his room. He picked up the trash bag he had flung across the room and put all her belongings inside. He pulled the magazine pictures from the walls and put them in the bag. He found the photograph of Justina and her father and kept that in his locker, facedown. He then opened her purse and rummaged through it. Inside he found some letters and a few used envelopes. He kept those too. Everything else he put inside the trash bag. He took the gallon of water he used to prop open the door and used it as a weight. He tied the bag around its handle.
Outside Will flung the jug as hard as he could. It did not go very far and he heard the dull splash it made when it hit the water and sank down. He leaned on the bulwarks and looked out. Soon he realized he had been staring at the water for some time, and it occurred to him that he was not thinking clearly. He panicked again that maybe he had done something wrong, something that could not be undone. But the feeling soon passed. He turned and was surprised to see that the sun had risen over the horizon. The sun was bright, very bright. Will squinted. He shielded his eyes with one hand and turned to go inside.











TRINIDAD








November 15
Captain Frank was in the middle of recording a new song that evening when he heard the platform’s tone from his room and ran up to the wheelhouse in just enough time to turn the Etowah away from collision. The incident shook up the crew for days – it was all they talked about – but for Captain Frank it was the catalyst that brought him back to life again.
That same night he took back command of the Etowah, sent Drew to get some sleep, and went over all the logs and course plotting, making a few corrections here and there as he saw fit. Then the very next day he took Drew aside and apologized for the way he had acted during the voyage, and swore he would never do anything so irresponsible again. Afterwards he held a crew meeting in the wheelhouse and made the same apology to them. They all saw he was sincere and everyone forgave him completely. Everyone forgave him except Will, who was not present at the meeting (he was not invited) and who had become something like a ghost in the days following the incident.
Will rose each day and performed the duties of his watch as usual, but he avoided contact with the others and found other things to do. He performed his sanitary each day, almost too well, prepared dinner for the night crew, and found odd-jobs to do, like pull down and re-stain the wood trim in the galley. Most days he ended his watch on the back deck, his arms hung over the bulwarks, gazing out at the water for hours until Nathan was up. The only thing he did not do was talk or think about that day. He put it away and coasted along as if he were on autopilot.
It was clear to him he was not wanted in the wheelhouse, so he never went up there anymore, although no one specifically forbade him when he did. The first watch after the incident, Will came up the stairs to the wheelhouse and heard Frank and Nathan having a conversation, but they quieted down when they heard him coming.
It had been three days since the incident. The days and nights were clear. The weather had died out completely, the seas were slick calm, the air warm, even hot in the afternoon. The Etowah was on schedule to enter port this afternoon. The vessel had already been instructed by the port authorities to stop in Port of Spain before continuing to Port Lisas further down the island. The authorities did not say why, but Frank acted like it was business as usual and he had made this trip before, so no one was much concerned.
Will came on watch that day and stayed in the galley after lunch. He was in the middle of drying the pans when the phone rang in the galley. Frank asked him to come to the wheelhouse.
As Will entered the wheelhouse, Nathan rose from the lookout chair and walked downstairs without even a nod to him. Will sat in the chair, picked up the binoculars, and surveyed the horizon. Neither he nor Frank said anything to one another for a long time. Will adjusted and readjusted the binoculars, went and observed the back deck, then turned on some music.
“Turn that shit off,” Frank said, “we’ll be in port soon and I need to hear the radios.”
Will turned off the music and went outside onto the wheelhouse deck. He saw nobody had put up the flag since they took it down for the storms. He decided to do that now, mainly to avoid the awkwardness of sitting up there. It only took a few minutes, but he managed to stretch it out to fifteen. Finally he came back indoors.
“Who told you to put that flag up?” Frank asked.
Will answered, “Drew said it needed to be flown while we’re out here, and we had to take it down during the storm. I saw it was still down just now and thought I’d take the initiative to put it back up.”
Frank did not respond. He looked pissed off.
“You ain’t the captain,” he began, “on this vessel if you do something it needs to be run by me first, or the officer on watch.”
“Roger.”
Will sat in the chair and watched the horizon. They sat in silence until Will could not take it.
“Frank,” he said, “I apologize for what happened. I know it was bad. I know it was real bad to leave the helm unmanned. I don’t have an excuse, so I want you and the crew to know I’m sorry. That’s all I can say.”
Frank was focused directly on the horizon ahead. Finally he said,
“Want you to go out there and hose off the boat, from the wheelhouse to the stern.”
“With the firehose, or can I use the red hose?”
“With the firehose.”
“Should I tell Jesse to turn on the water?”
“Not unless you can man a hose and turn on the water at the same time, then I guess you should tell Jesse to turn on the water.”
“Roger roger.”
Will went downstairs.
“Take that damn flag down first,” Frank shouted down the stairs, “so it don’t get wet.”
For the next hour and a half, Will hosed down the Etowah from bow to stern with freshwater. In weather like they had gone through during the last week, the boat becomes covered in seawater which turns to salt when it dries. The salt sticks to the paint and causes rust and corrosion. So it was regular to wash down the boat after a trip. 
Most newer boats have hoses specifically for this, which are larger than a garden hose, but smaller than fire hoses. Fire hoses are a bit of overkill and difficult to manhandle as you make your way over the decks. They get kinked and inevitably you run out of hose before you finish an area, so you have to pull out fifty feet of extra hose to reach one little spot. Then you have to drain and roll up whatever hoses you used.
Despite the pain-in-the-ass factor of it, Will had always enjoyed the work, but not today. He felt it was done as punishment more than anything else. Before he was even through with the 01 deck he was soaked from head to toe. As he worked he thought about the ways he might get back into the good graces of the crew. On the surface things seemed okay, but he noticed there were no jokes or storytelling anymore whenever he was around. With him it was always just boat business, instructions and orders. It was not that the crew no longer joked or told stories, but that he was not a part of them. He would listen through the door at night to Jesse and Martinez bullshitting in the galley. When he did his sanitary he could overhear Nathan and Drew going on about politics. Will tried to have conversations, but he was always met with forced laughter and eyes that looked away.
Going to his room at night was no good either. It felt empty there. He had done his best to rid the room of any evidence she had been there. He washed all the sheets and put them away, so now it was just a bare bunk. The photograph and the few other trinkets he kept from her purse, he stowed in the locker where he kept the rest of his things.
Will got so lost in thought while washing down the boat that it was a shock to him when he came to the bow and saw land in the distance ahead. He had known of course they would be arriving soon, but had not expected it to be so real. With everything else that had happened, Will forgot that he was excited to see another country, a new land. He closed the fire hose nozzle halfway and set it on the deck, then ran up to the front of the bow. Sure enough it was land. Now he saw satellites and platforms along the horizon, a few rigs. And vessels. It had been so long since Will had seen another vessel or any indication of human life outside the Etowah, it had begun to feel as if they were alone in the universe.
At this distance all he could make out was indistinct shapes. He did recognize it was a port. He thought he saw a couple large cranes at work. The boats coming out of the port dwarfed the Etowah by several hundred feet. One gigantic boat, probably three hundred and twenty feet long passed on the port side. There were hands out on the upper deck, doing maintenance work. Will waved to them, but they did not wave back. As the vessel passed it blocked out the sun. Most of the workers on board were dark-skinned and wore simple, old-fashioned clothes. After the boat passed he finished washing down the Etowah, rang Jesse to shut down the water, and then stayed on the back deck to prepare for mooring.
He pulled the mooring lines from the deck locker and faked them out on the deck boards. Then he unchained the gates and untied the gangway from the hose rack. They were now in the channel and passed buoys in regular intervals. They were different from the buoys in the Gulf. As he walked past the containment bin, Will saw his work from before they left had not held. Rust had eaten through the paint in many places. It would need to be buffed and repainted. Will saw gulls accumulate at the stern in increasing numbers. Since there was nothing else for him to do, he went inside to get some old bread.
Nathan was there in the galley at the coffee station. He poured two cups of coffee and nodded to Will as he entered.
Will said, “Looks like we almost there.”
“Sure is,” Nathan replied, “I been up top all morning. We got to go the port official before we head to the final destination. The captain got to sign something and they want to inspect the cargo and boat and crew.”
“Hey, I was about to go feed the seagulls. Want to come out there with me?”
“Frank needs me up there with him. Got to wake up Drew too. I’ll be out there when we go to moor.”
“I was just thinking,” Will said, “I hope Renee don’t call for you to go to another boat, like he did that one night. You remember? That would be some shit all the way down here.”
Nathan was confused, “Yeah? Oh, right. You done heard that story too many times, huh?”
“No. I didn’t mean that,” Will said, “Just giving you a hard time.”
Nathan nodded, “Well, I better get on up there again.”
“Okay man. See you out there then.”
Will walked to the stern and fed the gulls. Boats were passing more frequently. A shoddy crew boat went by without slowing down. It caused a high wake which made the Etowah bob up and down a few times. The gulls looked the same as they did in the States. There weren’t nearly as many as when they left Cameron, maybe thirty or forty. Soon he became bored and threw the rest of the loaf into the water.
As they entered the bay he was surprised at how modern everything was. He had imagined the island as if it were something from the nineteenth century. He saw cranes and new boats, metal buildings which resembled ones in the States, nothing unusual, nothing that would indicate he was in another country. The water in the bay was dull green. He could not see any obvious pollution. Behind the docks he could see the city itself, and even noticed some high buildings that could be considered skyscrapers. He caught glimpses of the roads and saw traffic, something else he had not expected. All the signs were in English. Overall it was different, but no different than visiting a new port in the Gulf.
The Etowah approached a small, barren dock apart from the others. Will stood at the stern, ready to heave the line onto the dock bit. The bits were small but large enough to hold a vessel their size. He looked to the wheelhouse and saw Frank at the stern controls. At that moment, Will came outside, donned his hard hat and safety vest, and joined Will at the stern. When the stern was close enough to the dock, Nathan jumped off and grabbed the eye, placing it onto the bit. Will did a round turn and a few figure eights around the horn to secure it. They repeated these steps for the midship and bow lines.
“Take up slack on that stern line,” Frank said, his voice coming through the loud hailer.
Will made his way back to the stern, pulled the slack from the line, and retied it. He gave a thumbs up to Frank, who was no longer at the controls. Nathan whistled at Will. He stood on the dock and pointed to the gangway. Will nodded and slid the gangway to the gate and lifted up the end to Nathan. The dock sat about three feet higher than the deck so there was a descent as you walked the gangway from the dock to the boat. Will secured the gangway with a tie-off line. Nathan came down the gangway onto the boat.
In the back corner of the dock sat a small building. The rest of the area was about a thousand square feet of empty space, except for a red tank and a small water pump at the opposite end. Will noticed the dockside was clean and well-kept. It had wooden bumpers lined with big tires, better than some of the docks in Louisiana for sure. The dock bits were painted red, but he could see they had painted over rust bubbles.
Ten minutes later three men emerged from the building. One man was clearly the supervisor. He wore a khaki shirt and blue pants and carried a clipboard with some paperwork fluttering in the wind. The other two men were younger and wore blue. All of them were dark-skinned and thin. Will and Nathan greeted them as they approached the gangway. The supervisor did not make eye contact, but one of the others nodded to him as he boarded the vessel. Drew came out and shook the supervisor’s hand and showed them into the galley. He turned to Will and Nathan before going inside.
“Hey guys, run get your tickets and STCW, any documentation you have. These guys need to see it. Bring it to the galley.”
Minutes later every crew member was in the galley, his documentation on display on the table. Nathan had prepared a fresh pot of coffee, but no one wanted any. Captain Frank seemed anxious to please the inspectors. He offered them something to eat, but they refused. The supervisor looked through each man’s documentation to make sure the photograph matched the man. He was not interested in the specifics of the documents, it seemed. Overall he was pleasant. Will’s initial impression of him had not been favorable, but he noticed that when addressing the officers he was more open and friendly. His accent was a thick Caribbean. While he was inspecting the paperwork, he sent the other two men out to the cargo to inspect that. They returned in minutes and said everything was a-ok. By this time the supervisor had gone through all the documentation and marked everything down. He set the clipboard on the table and had each one of them sign.
“Okay,” the supervisor said, “now that we have all the paperwork done I must have my men perform a brief inspection of your vessel. Is this fine with you captain? We will be cautious I assure you. My men will not touch your personal belongings or damage any part of the vessel. You are free to have your own men accompany mine as they do the inspection, of course.”
“No, it’s fine,” Frank answered, “Feel free to go wherever you like. If they need to inspect the engine room it may be safer if my oiler or engineer accompanies them.”
“Okay, captain. My men will need to inspect all areas of the boat. One man will inspect the outside from the pilothouse down, and the other will inspect the inside from the pilothouse down. When we reach the engine room, your men will accompany mine. Is this acceptable to you?”
“It is,” Frank answered.
“Fine,” the supervisor said.
The supervisor gestured to the two other men, and they immediately left the galley to perform the inspection. The supervisor went to the coffee station and poured himself a cup. There was no spoon to stir with so Will grabbed one for him. No one knew quite what to say after that. There was an awkward moment where nobody spoke.
“Have you,” the supervisor said to Frank, “or any of your men ever been to our island before?”
“Yes, sir,” Frank responded, “I have twice before. Jesse, I believe you came once before, is that right?”
“Yep,” Jesse said, “On the Charles River.”
The supervisor smiled. He walked over to Will.
“Tell me, young man, do you like your beard?”
“I like it okay,” Will answered.
“I would keep a beard myself,” the supervisor said, “but my wife does not let me. Do you have a wife at home?”
“No, sir.”
“Here we have a lucky man. Enjoy your freedom, and your beard.”
“Ain’t that the truth,” Drew said.
The supervisor laughed.
 “This man knows. Listen to him. I know you will all like it here in Trinidad. We like to have fun here. There are many good restaurants nearby. I hope you brought nicer clothes, however, or the ladies will not have anything to do with you. That is, unless you have money.”
Everyone laughed.
“We have the most beautiful women in the world here, I say. You have been here before, captain. What do you think?”
“I would agree,” Frank said, “Many beautiful ladies.”
The supervisor laughed again.
“Is that so? Well, then by any chance have you heard about the free sex contest?”
“What?” Frank asked, “No, I have not. What is that? Is that a custom?”
“No, no. They have it at all the local bars now. You need to go the first chance you get. Me and my brother Wedman, we go into the bar last week and see the sign up. My brother goes in there all the time, so I ask him how it works. He tells me, you see that jar on the counter there? I say, yes of course. He says, you need to put a dollar into the jar. Then you guess a number between one and ten, then tell that man behind the counter. If you guess it right, you get free sex. Simple. So I say, let me try that out, but be sure you don’t say anything to Maria (that’s my wife). So I put a dollar into the jar, and I say to the man behind the bar, two. He says no. That’s not it. The number was six. At this point I think the odds are not too bad. So I put in another dollar and say three. The man behind the counter says no again. The number was four. Then I turn to my brother Wedman and I say, Wedman, I think this contest might be rigged. He says, you know I thought the same thing at first too, but it turns out it’s not rigged. Your wife was in here last week and would you believe she won twice in a row.”
Everyone laughed. Captain Frank laughed the hardest of all. He couldn’t stop laughing. He hugged the supervisor around the shoulder with a grin.
“I like you man,” Frank said, “I like you.”
“Twice in a row,” the supervisor repeated. He laughed as much as the others at his own joke.
Will and Frank exchanged glances.
“Will,” Frank said, “go help out that man in the wheelhouse, make sure he can find what he needs.”
Will nodded and went upstairs.
By the time he got up there the inspector had already worked his way down to the lounge area. He was looking through the cabinets in a methodical way, and rose on his tiptoes to peer behind the television set.
“Hey,” Will said, “my captain wants me to go along with you and make sure you find everything you need.”
“I am fine,” the inspector said, without ceasing his work or making any eye contact with Will.
“You don’t have to call me sir,” Will said, “I’m only a hand.”
“Yes, sir.”
The inspector did a thorough job. He seemed to be looking for hidden places to hold contraband, drugs, weapons, illegal imports. After he was finished searching the lounge he pointed to the doors down the hallway.
“These are the crew quarters?”
“Yes,” Will said, “do you need to look in there?”
“We must search the entire boat.”
“The doors should be unlocked. You can go on in.”
The inspector entered the first room. “Engineer” was written in permanent marker on the door. It was a mess in there. Will had never been inside Jesse’s room before. There were clothes scattered all over the deck and old plates of food on a table. A broken TV set sat overturned in the corner. He remembered Jesse complaining last hitch about the TV coming loose in the rough weather and hitting the deck. The inspector found some pill bottles in the desk drawer and carefully read the labels. He opened the bottles one by one and poured the contents onto the desktop, comparing the description of the pill on the bottle to actual pill. Fortunately they matched up. After he found the pills he went back through the room once more, this time reaching into crevices between the bunks and feeling the wood-paneling for any loose opening. He found nothing.
The next room down the hallway was Martinez’s. No writing was on his door. Will knew his room would be immaculate. He had been in there several times before. And it was. Martinez liked to decorate his space with things from his house to make it more comfortable. He even brought a rug from his house to keep on the deck. It was brightly colored with bands of triangles and diamond patterns. He said his wife had woven it herself, but Will did not believe him. The inspector walked in and tracked dirt on the rug. Will knew Martinez would flip out, but said nothing. There was a sheet draped over his bunk, used as a sort of privacy canopy. All the other bunks in the room were made up. Inside the locker was a neat arrangement of his personal belongings, a picture frame of him and his wife, and a painting of the Virgin Mary taped to the inside door. There was a light blue rosary hung on a nail beside it. The inspector respected the neatness of the room and did not disturb anything, except for the rug. But he felt in all the crevices just the same.
There was a spare room down the hallway. It was used as a storage area for sheets and blankets, pillows. The inspector searched this room the most thoroughly. He went through all the pillows and mashed them with his hands. He lifted up the spare mattresses on the bunks and looked through all the lockers. Then he had Will help him flip mattresses and look underneath. He found nothing here either except for a few porno magazines in the bottom and gave Will a knowing wink. All the time the inspector never said a word to him. Will tried to make small talk, but ended up just following along behind the inspector like a dog.
Drew’s room was pretty clean. Like Martinez’s room all the bunks were made up except for the bunk directly above his own. Up there he kept all his toiletries, a CD player, candy bars, and a large duffle bag. On the deck he had rigged up an entertainment center. He had an old wooden wire spool with a small TV on top of it and a DVD player on top of that. The inspector looked through all Drew’s belongings, but for some reason he kept returning to the duffle bag on the bunk. He flipped through the case of videos. He pointed to one movie and said to Will, “I saw that one. Very funny.” Will looked at the disc and agreed, “I thought so too.”
Will had expected a clean space in Nathan’s room, but there were clothes scattered all over and none of the bunks were made up. In the space between his mattress and the side of the bunk were many Christian books. The inspector looked everything over, but when he saw the books he did not do a thorough search of what remained. He opened the lockers, but did not go through them as he had the previous rooms.
The final room down the hall was the captain’s. The inspector entered first and Will followed. He had never seen inside the captain’s room. He had a full desk and chair in the far corner. He already knew that Frank’s room had its own head and he walked back there to take a look, while the inspector searched through the cabinets. What surprised the inspector most was the microphone and four-track recorder in the corner, next to the single bunk in the room. The microphone was rigged on a broom handle. It hung over a small stool where Frank sat with his guitar to record songs. The guitar was behind the stool, leaned against the bulkhead. The inspector asked Will what it was for. “Music,” Will answered, pointing to the guitar, “Recording music. He’s a musician.” The inspector was skeptical, but after a search was convinced it was nothing contraband. Will wanted to listen to what Frank had recorded while holed up in the room, but by that point the inspector was finished so they went out.
After a quick run-through of the upstairs head both Will and the inspector descended into the galley. By that time the other inspector had finished with the outside, so the two of them searched through the galley, walk-in, pantry, and then down the hallway to the head and to Will’s room.
All the others were still in the galley. The atmosphere was relaxed. Martinez was in the middle of a story when they came down. There was a bit of awkwardness when the inspectors rummaged through the galley cabinets. They made a lot of noise when the pots and pans were moved around. The inspector who went through the cooler and freezer came out rubbing his arms, and laughing, “Cold in there, man.”
Will followed the other inspector down the hall to his room. The inspector turned the knob and found the door locked. Everyone in the galley noticed and stopped talking.
“And why is your door locked?” Drew asked.
“I must have locked it by accident,” Will said, “Let me get a screwdriver. I can open it.”
“Hurry up,” Frank said, “these gentlemen have other things to do besides inspect work boats all day.”
Will ran to the pantry and grabbed the screwdriver. He popped the vent with little difficulty and reached up to open the door. Once inside the inspector went through the locker. He opened Will’s toiletries bag. There were clothes on the deck and on the vacant bunk. Will picked them up and threw them into the corner. The inspector lifted up the mattresses of each of the bunks. Because the room was locked Will figured the inspector did a more thorough search on his room. There was no corner or crevice he did not inspect. Eventually he was satisfied and went out into the galley. Will shut the door and joined the others.
The inspectors finished by giving the engine room a once-over. Both Jesse and Martinez went down with them. In the meantime, Nathan started a gumbo in the cast iron Dutch oven. When the supervisor smelled the onions and celery cooking down he breathed deeply in.
“Now that smells like a feast,” the supervisor said, “You will eat well today. Me and my men will eat well too. You are making me hungry.”
#
Before long the Etowah was underway again, en route to Port Lisas. Nathan asked Will to stir the gumbo and cook some rice when it was time, so he could get some rest. Frank and Drew were in the wheelhouse, and Jesse was on the back deck, smoking. Martinez was down in the engine room, because when walking with the inspectors, he checked the oil on the bow thruster and saw it had been using, so he was looking into that.
Will put away the dishes from earlier and stirred the thick gumbo gravy. Its thick aroma filled the galley and made Will hungry. He had not eaten breakfast. The time came to put on the rice, so he scooped two cups into the rice cooker. About that time Drew came down into the galley.
“Will,” he said.
“Hey Drew,” Will said, “how much longer till we get there? I need to put on a load of clothes.”
“Better hold off on that. We making a stop at a dock a little ways from here. Got another hand coming on.”
“Really? What for?”
“Cause you’ll be flying back to the States tomorrow. Renee just called and said so.”
“What?”
“Look here,” Drew said. He was impatient. “I’ll watch that gumbo. You need to pack your shit. We don’t have a lot of time.”
Will handed Drew the spoon and wiped his hands on his jeans.
“Well, damn,” Will said, “This sucks. I mean, maybe I should go talk to Frank. Maybe, you could say something to him, or to the office.”
“We already had that discussion, and we all agreed this would be the best course of action.”
“I see,” Will said, “Okay. I guess I’ll go pack my bags then.”
“Sounds like a plan.”
“Do you think I should be put off the boat? I mean, Frank was in his room the entire trip. What about that? Did anybody bring that up to the office?”
“Will, I don’t know what to tell you,” Drew said. His attention turned from Will towards the steaming pot of gumbo. He stirred its contents, took a big whiff, and would not say anything more.
#
They rode another twenty minutes and tied up at a dock alongside another work boat named the Vanessa Grace. It was a newer vessel than the Etowah with a red hull and yellow cabin. Its main deck was completely covered with survey equipment and small portable buildings. It was moored to the dock where the Etowah was supposed to change hands. The dock was extremely run down. There were two rusted shacks and a small broken crane that looked like it hadn’t been used for years. 
Drew came down after they were tied alongside the Vanessa and told Will to get ready because the other hand was on his way from the Elkhorn River to relieve him. Will had all sorts of questions and Drew answered him the best he could, since Frank did not want to see Will. The driver was supposed to take Will to a local hotel where the company had reserved a room, and tomorrow morning he was booked for a flight to New Orleans, and from there a driver would pick him up and carry him to the main office in Houma.
Will packed his things. It took no more than ten minutes or so to shove everything into the over-sized duffle bag, throw his sheets and blankets into the washing machine, and then make a quick sweep of the room. Once packed there was nothing more to do except wait. Will stood in his room for a few minutes and then walked out and closed the door. He left his bag next to the galley table and went upstairs.
The light was on in Martinez’s room. Will knocked a few times.
“My friend,” Will shouted, “It’s me.”
Martinez opened the door. He was in the middle of changing into a new shirt. The work in the engine room had ruined one of his good shirts.
“How you doing, my friend?” Martinez said, “We at the dock already? I thought it was gonna take an hour to get down there.”
“No, man. We stopped to pick up another hand. I’m leaving the boat. They are sending me back to Houma.”
“To Houma?” Martinez asked, “What, you gonna swim there?”
“No man, they’re flying me back tomorrow morning. That’s what we’re waiting on. I guess Frank didn’t want me on the boat. I really don’t know.”
“Yeah, okay. So what you going to do now, my friend?”
“I guess fly back and see what happens. I don’t really like planes but what choice do I have?”
“You think they going to fire your ass?”
“I hope not. I don’t see why they would. Nothing actually happened.”
Martinez nodded, then held up a finger, “Oh, my friend. Hold on for a minute. I have something I want to give to you.”
Will laughed, “Okay, what you got?”
Martinez went to his locker and reached inside. He pulled out the old pocket knife and handed it to Will.
“But I gave this to you,” Will said, “It’s yours.”
“Yeah, I know,” Martinez said, “But now I think maybe you need it more than me.”
“Well I don’t need it. I have a new one. Plus it don’t have a serrated-edge anymore. What am I going to do with it?”
“I don’t know, my friend.”
“Okay,” Will said, “I guess I’m gonna go wait outside until the new guy gets here.”
Martinez said, “Okay, my friend. I have many things to do in the engine room. I’ll see you later, okay?”
Will walked out and shut the door. He walked downstairs and onto the back deck.
#
It was past time for the other hand to arrive, and Will was tired of waiting, so he found a garbage bin at one end of the dock and decided to take off the trash. He fought with the large, white bag they had put all the trash into on the voyage down. There must have been twenty bags inside. When he opened it a foul odor overtook the air and suffocated him. Flies buzzed all around. He held his breath and pulled out a few bags.
Hauling the trash across the deck of the Vanessa was a pain. There was so much machinery and equipment on the deck it was like navigating a maze to reach dockside. Each time he made a trip and returned to the Etowah, he looked for his other crewmates, but no one was around. 
Will went inside and washed the Dutch oven and pots from lunch. He had not eaten any of the gumbo himself. He scooped the leftovers into some Tupperware and labeled them with the date. After the dishes were cleaned and put away he went to the wheelhouse, but no one was up there either. He finally went back outside and waited on the deck.
Soon a young man appeared at the gate. He wore a gray company work shirt just like Will’s.
“Hey man, is this the Etowah River? I can’t see from the dock, but it looks like one of ours.”
“Yeah, man,” Will answered, “this is the Etowah.”
“Great news. Been driving around for half an hour. Hey, can you give me a hand with my bags, buddy?”
“Sure thing.”
“My name’s Gary by the way.”
“Will.”
“You’re the guy I’m relieving right?”
Will nodded. He helped Gary bring over his bags, five in all. One was extremely heavy.
“Sorry about this one, bro,” Gary said, “It’s my workout equipment. You work out?”
“Not really. Do some push-ups and sit-ups from time to time.”
“I hear you. Look, better grab this one from the bottom.”
It took all this strength not to drop the bag right away. Will slowly set it down onto the deck and rubbed his right arm.
“Jesus,” Will said.
“I know, right?”
Finally Gary jumped on board himself and shook Will’s hand. He was shorter than Will, but stockier. He had an expensive pair of sunglasses pushed up on his head and wore shorts and flip flops. It looked like he had been on vaction. Will helped him carry his bags into the cabin and from there Will showed him to his room.
“This was my room,” Will said, “The bow thruster is a little loud in here. There is another room up top, but it’s filled with blankets and sheets and shit. You’re welcome to go up there too. But it’s a mess.”
“I may do that tomorrow then,” Gary said, “Hey, am I off watch? I haven’t slept in like three days, man.”
“No, you’re on watch until midnight. Nathan is your relief. Sorry about that. I don’t know where everybody else is. You might want to ask Drew whenever you see him. He might let you sleep or something. I don’t know how much longer we’re gonna be here. Think you guys are shoving off to Port Lisas.”
“Drew Melancon?”
“Yeah,” Will nodded, “You know him?”
“Oh yeah. Worked with Drew on the Yukon for a long time. Who’s the captain?”
“Frank Davenport.”
“No shit. Does he still play the guitar?”
“All the time.”
“Yeah, I worked with Frank too. Is this your regular boat?”
“Yeah.”
“So why you head back to the States? You just got here man. I tell you what, bro. There are whores all over the place. Me and the mate on the Elkhorn brought some to the boat last night. Cheap and fucking wild, dude. Pretty skinny little things, light-skinned and nasty as fuck.”
“Oh really?” Will said, “I’m supposed to fly back tomorrow.”
“That’s cool. Well, have a good trip, dude. The driver seemed a little impatient. You might want to get out there before he takes off, know what I mean?”
“Oh,” Will said, “Before I go I wanted to show you the work we’ve been doing on the deck. I chipped and painted the port containment bin right before we left, but it’s already rusted through again.”
“Did you use Enrust on it?”
“We didn’t have enough time.”
“Yeah, that’s why right there. You got to use Enrust on it. It’s cool. We’ll get it done right this time.”
Will picked up his two bags from galley and walked outside. He put on his work vest. Jesse was there on the chain locker, smoking a cigarette and listening to his headphones. When he saw Gary come outside he jumped up and pulled the earphones off so they hung around his neck.
“Motherfucker, I told you if I ever saw you again I was gonna kick your sorry ass.”
Both Gary and Jesse put up their fists and had a pretend fight. They circled one another for a couple seconds, and then Jesse shot out his hand.
“How you been, motherfucker? Haven’t seen your ass since we was on the Yukon.” Jesse laughed and shook his head, “Fuckin’ Gary, man. I’ll be damned.”
“I know, man” Gary said, “Damn, we had some fun on that boat. What you think? We gonna work out of Trinidad for awhile for what?”
“Naw, bro. I bet we head back to the States in a few days.”
Will stood by and watched them. Finally there was a lull in the conversation and he took the opportunity to speak up.
“Well, I guess I’m heading on. Have a good trip. I’ll see you guys later.”
He shook hands with Gary and then Jesse.
“Will, dude,” Jesse said, “It’s been real and it’s been fun, but it ain’t been real fun.”
Will picked up his bags and navigated through the corridors of machinery on the Vanessa. He heard Jesse and Gary get louder and louder as they resumed their conversation. Will hopped onto the dock with both bags. It strained his knees, but he was okay. The driver was there, leaning against an old beat-up pickup truck, his arms crossed. He looked asleep, but woke up quick enough when he saw Will approach. He was an older man, maybe in his late fifties. He wore a straw hat and a white t-shirt and shorts.
“Throw your bags in the back there,” he said. 
His voice had the same thick accent as the port supervisor. Will did as he said and then walked up and shook his hand.
“How are you today, sir?”
“Fine.”
“So, are you to go to the Holiday Inn from here?”
“I guess,” Will said, “I really haven’t heard. You probably know more than me.”
“Yes, in fact. You are to go to the Holiday Inn they tell me. I will take you there and then go home to my family for the evening.”
“Sounds like a plan.”
They were on the road. It was a warm day and Will rolled down the window to let the breeze blow in. The driver rolled his down as well. Music played on the radio but it was nothing Will recognized. They navigated a few side streets and alleyways before joining the main highway. The small roads left the impression of a foreign country. Compared to roads in the US they were much narrower. They passed a few cars on these roads and had to get over as far as they could. The buildings on these roads were shabby. The people who walked the roads and rode bikes alongside them resembled the people he had seen in magazines before. You could not say it was beautiful here. It looked like any other urban landscape, but from the air you knew you were close to the sea. The air was clean and the sun was bright. In the far distance was a large, green mountain obscured in haze.
By this time it was afternoon. They passed some small restaurants with open areas out front. Will smelled the food and his stomach churned. The driver was mostly silent. He would ask the odd question about whether Will had been here before, how did he like it so far, and other small talk. Will answered politely, but did not feel up to a conversation, so he kept his replies short. Once they merged onto the highway Will realized that this was a city like any city he had ever been to. It was a modern, four-lane highway, with green signs overhead pointing out the exits when they came. The only things unfamiliar to him were the palm trees, which lined the median. Their tall, thin trunks reached out over the road and the leaves blew in the breeze and cast shadows on the pavement below. Will asked if there were any good restaurants nearby the hotel. “There are many,” the driver replied, “too many to name. When we get closer I will show you which are the best.”
Will was glad he thought to change into civilian clothes. It was much too warm here for the fall weather work clothes he wore. He now had on jeans and a white t-shirt. Since he was away from the boat he could smell the strong diesel odor which permeated his self and his bags. He couldn’t wait to get to the hotel room and take a shower.
The driver took the next exit and in the distance Will saw several familiar hotel chains in a row. He saw the Holiday Inn well before they reached it. The driver pointed out a couple restaurants close by that were his personal favorites. They pulled into the parking lot and around underneath the canopy in front of the main entrance. A worker stood out front and approached the truck. He saw the bags in the back and lifted them onto the ground. Will did not get out immediately. He sat there until the driver had to say something.
“We are here, sir. You do not have to pay me. The company took care of everything. Have a nice day now.”
Will nodded and leaned out the window and told the doorman not to take his bags inside just yet. He told the driver to wait a moment, and jumped out of the truck. He rummaged through his duffle bag and pulled out an envelope and his wallet. He leaned onto the window of the truck and handed the envelope to the driver.
“Take me here first.”
The driver was surprised. He studied the address on the envelope and nodded, as if he knew it, but then looked up and shook his head no.
“This is very far from here, sir, down the island. It would be a long drive for this late in the day. I cannot help you. Perhaps you can pay someone to take you tomorrow.”
Will had taken some money out of his wallet, all the cash he had plus the money Justina had given him on the first night, about two hundred and thirty dollars. He put the money into the driver’s hand. The driver counted the money and gave Will a puzzled look.
#
There was only one main road which led down the coast, out of Port of Spain. The driver said it would take a couple hours to make the drive. Where they were heading was a small town off the main road. As they drove Will saw the natural landscape come more into view. He thought this was the real Trinidad. It was interesting to see the color of their surroundings go from asphalt gray to tropical green in the space of half an hour. By the time they were well clear of Port of Spain all that surrounded them were trees of various sizes and green grass and sand. The driver told Will he was glad to get a chance to drive down here. It was so rare that he came. They passed through several small villages. It was here Will could see the poverty of the country. Port of Spain had resembled most cities he knew from the States, but Will had never seen places like his outside of movies or photographs. The driver pointed out the palm trees, which Will had already noticed, but also mango trees and bushes. There were bright flowers which dotted the green and many, many birds.
“How beautiful is our island?” the driver asked.
“Very beautiful,” Will replied.
Here the houses were shacks for the most part, and most of them were painted in pastel colors, some freshly-painted, some old. The businesses were just small open shacks. Will noticed an old man in one of them. The sign on top read Bait and Tackle. He saw a few Americans out there too. Most of the homes they passed had cars in the driveways, but they were smaller cars than he was used to. Will did not see any American made vehicles at all. There were kids who played in the street and whenever a car came by they would have to interrupt the game. This happened when they passed. The driver honked his horn and the children laughed and waved.
By now Will was very hungry. He felt stupid for not asking the driver to stop earlier. There were so many other things on his mind. It felt as if there were a hole in his gut. The driver heard his stomach growl and mentioned they could stop somewhere on the way back, closer to Port of Spain. Will thanked him.
It was now late in the afternoon and the sun was low on the horizon. Its light shimmered across the ocean. Will sometimes glimpsed it from the road. They entered a very small town where the roads were only wide enough for one car at a time. Luckily, they did not meet a single car on the way through. It was cooler and the forest surrounding them had come to life. Insects chirped and buzzed all around. The trees shielded the afternoon light and made everything much darker here than on the road above town, a dim twilight. The driver switched on the headlights so they could navigate the winding, narrow road. Will saw patches on the hills where many small homes were packed together. Some, however, were off by themselves. The driver said this was the destination.
He showed Will how to interpret the address based on how the mailboxes were labeled. They drove around until they were on a hilltop which overlooked the village. Will looked over the other side and saw the ocean below. He thought if he walked down the small road into the village he would find the address on the envelope, based on what the driver had shown him. The driver asked him to please not take very long. Will assured him it would only take fifteen minutes or so, since he only needed to pass along a message. The driver nodded and turned up the volume on the radio. Will got out of the truck and went through his bag. He pulled out the old Polaroid and took the envelope with the address and descended on the road.
Soon he came to an old shack off from the main block of houses. The house was old and the mailbox out front was nearly rusted through. Will came up to it and tried to make out the number on the box. He thought it was the right one, but was not entirely sure. He could see into the window of the house. There was a light inside. He reasoned even if this were not the house, he could ask directions. He went up the steps and stood underneath the porch. On the porch was an old swing that had fallen at one side. Will knocked on the screen door and peered through a side window. Inside he saw garbage and used dishes piled everywhere. He heard movement from within and stood there anxious.
When the old man opened the door Will knew right away that it was the same man in the photograph he held in his hands. He could tell it by the eyes, which were more sunken, but the same. The old man came out onto the porch as if he did not want Will to come any closer into his home. He stood between the door and screen door, his hand ready to slam the door in Will’s face at any time. Will noticed the empty sleeve of the old man’s shirt dangle freely at one side. His face had grown more wrinkled from the one Will knew from the photograph, and he wore a week-old growth of whiskers, which grew in uneven patches on his face.
Will began at once to explain who he was and what had happened on the voyage. It was clear from the beginning that the old man did not know English well enough to comprehend him. It had been Will’s hope that he would. Finally he had to just show him the Polaroid. The old man took it from Will when he recognized it. He then eyed Will with severe violence and tore the photograph into pieces. He cursed under his breath. Will tried to stop him, but the old man jerked away and finished the job. He threw down the pieces onto the porch and began to shout. Will tried to explain in every way what had happened. He used every gesture he could think of, but it was no good. The old man did not understand him. He told the old man to wait, so he could grab the driver to see if perhaps the driver could communicate with him, but the old man did not care. Instead, he flung open the screen door and lunged at him. Will jumped backwards and stumbled down the porch steps. He caught himself on the post before he fell to the ground. By this time the old man was cursing at Will with all his strength. There was only one time that Will caught anything he said, maybe a few words of English the old man had picked up over the years.
“Filthy whore! Dirty Goddamn whore,“ the old man said.
He pointed to the road and kicked in Will’s direction. Will did not know what to say or do. He picked up the pieces of the photograph which lay on the porch, but could not manage to get them all. The entire time he shook his head at the old man and asked him to please try to understand. The old man then pulled a small knife out from his belt and backed Will away from the porch. He spit on the pieces of the photograph Will held in his hands and jabbed the knife towards the road. Will backed away past the mailbox. He looked up the hill and saw the driver standing outside the truck. The driver gestured to Will with impatience and pointed to the watch on his wrist.
Without another thought, Will turned down the road and walked in the opposite direction. As he went he heard the driver’s angry shouting. He heard the screen door slam as her father went back into the house. Will felt at this moment that if he could just get away from this valley, then everything would be okay. The road he walked became narrower and narrower the further down he went. He passed homes and small buildings along the way. It was now evening and he saw lights in all the windows he passed. He saw no people. The constant noise which emanated from the forest intimidated him. Soon he heard the driver’s truck crank and drive off in the distance, but he did not look back. Before long the small road met up with the larger one above. He kept walking. The first thing to do was to find a place to get food. The smell of dinner was strong as he passed one of the houses, likely a stew. It was strange. He could not remember the last time he had eaten from real hunger.
It was dark now, very dark. The moon in the night sky was at three-quarters and outlined his surroundings. Without the moon he would have been lost. He kept close to the forest as he walked the road. There were no cars. The driver had mentioned another town, a larger town, further down the road. If he reached this town maybe he could find a place to eat. Instinctively, Will felt into his back pocket. His wallet was not there. It was still in the duffle bag on the back of the truck. No matter. This was the sort of country where you could still work off a meal. He wondered what sort of food they would have. Probably some kind of fresh fish sandwich. Shark bake, he had read on a sign they passed earlier in the day. And a side dish. Potato salad sounded the best. He wondered where on the map he was. His arms were cold. The night air here was much cooler than during the daytime. He folded them against his chest to keep warm. He thought it was good luck he had changed into his civilian shoes at least. To have walked this distance in his steel-toes would have been a nightmare.
The sounds which emanated from the woods all around him were foreign and threatening. He did not recognize the shrill vibrations and wondered what kind of insect made them. He thought about the pictures he had seen of tropical snakes and other poisonous creatures. They were all colored bright to warn you to stay away, but he would not be able to see the color in the moon light. As long as he stuck to the road he would be fine. Likely they stayed far from the roads where they knew humans would be. It was like that in Georgia. The bears stayed away from the roads. Occasionally a hungry one would find his way onto the main road and frighten the drivers, but that was rare.
In the distance he saw headlights. He went faster in that direction. It was a car. He put out his thumb and quickened his pace even more. In a couple minutes the car drove by going much faster than was safe for a road this size. It went past without slowing. Will kept his thumb out for a moment, but then folded his arms back against his chest. He felt angry. This was just the sort of thing he always did, and it was okay to do this sort of thing when you had a bed to sleep in at night, but there were no beds out here. He was tired. It could not be his normal sleeping time yet, although he was not sure of the time, but the combination of the walking and the hunger had slowly worn him down. It could not be much further to the town. For some time he had heard the sound of the ocean on his left. Every now and then he came to an opening in the woods. He was sure it would take him down to the beach.
Will turned down the next opening he found. He thought it might be good to see the ocean and rest his legs before continuing. His hunger was now a constant physical pain in his side. The road which led to the shoreline was no more than an unpaved trail. As he walked underneath the canopy of trees there was no moon light to see by. He almost turned back since it seemed dangerous, but maybe forty or fifty yards away he could see the shimmering of the water between the trees. He kept walking. At some point he must have gotten off the trail, as the ground became rough. He tripped over twigs and vines. He was close now and pushed his way through the bushes and brush. The insect sounds were all around him, but he knew if he just kept moving they could not harm him.
Then he emerged from the woods. He came out at a point far from the main trail. He saw the entrance thirty yards or so down. Without the surrounding trees the moon light illuminated everything. He looked down the length of beach. It stretched maybe a quarter of a mile down then disappeared with the curve of the island. The beach was clean. There was no debris, a log here and there. Will walked to the nearest log and leaned against it. A few yards away, against another log, he spotted a young couple there entwined. His hand was between her legs, his other on her exposed breast. But they did not notice him. In their passion each seemed oblivious to anything that was not the other. He noticed their orange hatchback some ways off, close to the entrance of the trail. He left them and continued closer to the shoreline. There he found another log and collapsed against it.
#
His bare feet shuffled through the dry, autumn leaves as he went up the back trail behind the old house. As he went he watched his breath come out in regular intervals like smoke from a train. His toes had been numb for some time, yet he still felt it whenever they found a patch of clay earth under the grass. The afternoon sunlight came overhead through the bare branches of the oak and maple trees. He breathed in the clear, cold air and gazed at the blue sky overhead, where thin wisps of cloud passed by.
Soon he came out of the woods and entered a meadow where the neighbor’s horses grazed. The field grass was high, covered by frost, and he brushed his hands lightly over their tops as he walked. He reached the fence on the opposite side and climbed with ease through the rusty old barbed-wire, just like he had over countless summer days.
He came to the driveway. The concrete was less cold on his bare feet than the ground, but still very cold. In the open garage sat the station wagon, the old brown one that broke down on the way to Florida. He went in through the garage, as always, and made sure to hit the switch to close the door. The garage door mechanism rolled down and he watched it until it was all the way shut. Once inside he felt the warmth begin to thaw his feet and toes. He passed through the laundry room into the kitchen.
The aroma of baked apples filled the room. Entering, he realized he was just in time to grab the mitt and pull the casserole dish from the oven. He set the dish on the counter underneath a dish towel. Steam poured out when the lid was removed. They were still a little too hot to eat, so he went to the cabinet and got out a mug. He opened the refrigerator and pulled out a gallon of milk. From the pantry he got two packs of hot cocoa mix. He heated the milk in the microwave and stirred in the mix. He then sat the kitchen table and drank it down in a few gulps. By that time he figured the apples were cool enough to eat. He got a bowl and scooped two of them out with a large spoon. They were just warm enough to steam when he cut through with the fork. He poured a little milk into the bowl and ate the apples greedily. His energy returned. Afterwards he took the bowl and fork to the sink and covered the casserole dish with foil. Then he put it in the refrigerator and wiped his hands on a paper towel.
He continued through the house. In the den was the TV. There was a Nascar race on. He sat on the couch and watched it. Car racing had never interested him, but he always caught himself watching the races whenever he found one, mostly to look for whatever it was his father saw in them. After ten minutes he became bored and switched off the set. On the table in front of him was a stack of magazines, mostly home-making and celebrity gossip. He flipped through a couple to see what was new. He found a few recipes with photos that looked good to eat. He noticed there were some dirty cups and dishes on the end table and took those to the kitchen sink. The sink was full. He thought someone should probably wash those dishes. But not him.
Then he went down the long hallway to the bedrooms. The first one he came to was his parent’s room. It was dim inside, except for a small light which seeped around the window shades. The bed was unmade and clothes were strewn all over the floor. He felt as if he should not go into the room, so he just stood in the doorway. On top of the drawers beside the door sat little angel statues, a jewelry box, some change, and an opened tin of cherry lozenges. He had been forbidden to eat any of those because they were for medicine and not candy. But since no one was around he took a couple and ate them one by one. At first they tasted sweet, but soon his throat became numb and he wished he hadn’t.
When he came to his own room, the room he shared with his brother, he remembered he was supposed to have his room clean by the end of the day. It bothered him that his younger brother always got out of chores like that, but he was the older brother, after all. There were toys and clothes all over the floors and on the bunk beds. He gathered his collection of robots and placed them in the box his mother had specifically made for them. The clothes he took to the hamper in the hall bathroom. After awhile the toys were in their proper places and the dirty clothes were in the hamper and the clean ones were in the drawers. He took the time to make the beds too. He made his brother’s first since it was the easiest. It was the bottom bunk. They both used cartoon-themed sleeping bags this time of year, so it was no trouble to fluff the pillow and stretch out the bag over the bed. It was a little more work to make his own bed, but he knew it would impress his mother when she saw it.
Next he looked into his sister’s room. Of course it was clean. Every object in the room was either white or had pink highlights. You couldn’t pay him a million bucks to sleep here. There were a few stuffed animals on the bed and a picture frame of the whole family on her nightstand. He walked to the nightstand and picked up the frame. For just a moment it occurred to him that the photo he was looking at would not be taken for several years, after his parents were long divorced, and his brother and sister were married with their own kids. He set the picture frame on the nightstand and walked out of the room.
He came to the back porch, an enclosed space which his father had claimed as his personal workshop. On the shelves the tools were neatly organized. The whole place smelled of sawdust and motor oil. He saw on the wall a dusty plaque which his father had kept from when he was a truck driver. It had all the years he had qualified for the safe driver award. In the corner was a stand with all the trophies his father had won at car shows throughout the years. There were many of them, of all different colors and sizes. They were cheaply made, but his father displayed them with pride. He went over a couple and read the years and the event. On the ground next to the trophies was an orange extension cord. He followed it and saw it running outside the door to the back yard. He opened the door and went outside again. A blast of cold wind hit him in the face. He shivered and rubbed both arms together.
In the backyard he saw the old Camaro his father had kept since he bought it new in 1969. At one time it had been a shiny, metallic blue with mag wheels and a souped-up 350 engine. Now it sat rusted on four cinder blocks where the wheels ought to be. It was an on-going project for his father to restore the car and take it to shows, but that took a lot of money and time, both of which were short these days. He could see his father was in the process of replacing the rear end, as the back end of the car was jacked up and the rear axle sat a few yards away on the grass. He remembered he was supposed to help his father with the project, but had not done anything so far. The extension cord went underneath the car and he saw it was attached to a garage light.
He rolled on his back and crawled underneath the old car to get a handle on the situation. He surveyed the work remaining, and then went to it. It was a two-man job really, but in the right position and with a little elbow grease he was able to put everything back together. Only a few times did he even need to refer to the manual his dad kept in the toolbox next to the car. There was one tool missing, so he looked for it in the workshop. He never did find it and was a little worried that his father would return that evening and be angry with him. As he wiped his hands clean on an old rag, he felt a nip at his feet, as if something were attempting to bite off his toes. He looked down and saw a little sand crab no bigger than a half dollar. He saw a few of them now. They rose out of the frozen soil at his feet, crawling towards him underneath the car.

Will kicked the little crabs away. He got up on the log and watched them for a few moments. He had not remembered taking off his shoes and socks, but there they were on the log beside him. The crabs seem attracted to him and would not leave entirely. But once he was out of their range for a certain length of time, they disappeared under the sand again. Occasionally, one would poke out and scurry a few feet then dive back in. 
Now the moon was low in the sky and his surroundings were dark. It was hard to tell how long he had slept, but it was much colder than before. Will wished he had at least remembered to bring along a jacket. A breeze blew in from the sea and he shivered and folded his arms close to his chest. He looked down the beach. The couple who had been there was gone now. The car was gone too. Will looked towards the sky. He had never seen the stars shine so bright in the night sky. He dried his eyes and lay back against the log and admired them, feeling at that moment like he could stare up at them forever and be perfectly content.
Then he rose from the log and walked to the shoreline. His hunger was still there, yet it no longer bothered him as if had before. He could stay that way for a long time if he had to. He knelt and traced his fingers through the wet sand and picked up a small clump, which he then let fall through the spaces between his fingers. He noticed the tall, thin palm trees hung over the beach, all the way down, their leaves blowing in all directions. The little crabs poked out here and there and nipped at his bare feet. It tickled when he felt their futile pinches against his soles. “Keep it up and I’ll catch one of you little guys for supper,” he smiled. Thirty yards out a gathering of sharp rocks jutted from the sea, creating a natural sound. There the waves crested so that by the time they reached the shoreline, where he stood, they lapped gently over his feet. The sea itself was as dark as the night sky, its only illumination a faint glow of moonlight outlining the undulation of the waters.
