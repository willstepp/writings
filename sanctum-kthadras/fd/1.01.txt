One

   At the entrance was a gray box with a white panel and a glowing red dot on top. He had observed the driver ahead of him press a keycard to the panel, at which point the dot turned green and the gate lifted, allowing his BMW to pass through. Now it was his turn. He put the Jeep into park and fumbled through a manila folder on the passenger seat. After a brief moment of panic he found the keycard paper-clipped to his W4 and pressed it against the panel, noticing as he did the growing line of cars now backed into the main road. The red dot blinked twice, but did not turn green as it had for the BMW, and the gate did not open.
	He sighed.
	"Of course it doesn't work. Why would it?"
	There was impatient beeping and honking from the line. He attempted the keycard once again to no effect and then gestured in frustration towards the box for everyone to see. Then, just as he was about to u-turn out of line and phone Tammy Blankenship from HR, he noticed an attractive woman in a camel-hair peacoat approaching in the rear-view mirror. Around her neck she wore a retractable badge with a keycard inside. When she reached the pox she held her own badge up to the panel. The dot turned green and the gate lifted.
	"Sorry about that," he said, "First day."
	But the woman was already headed back to her car without so much as a glance in his direction. She responded to his lame apology with a quick "Naw you good", which for some reason irritated him. But the gate was open.
	As he entered the technology park slits of rain appeared on the windshield. The sky was thick with dark clouds and though it was 7:30 in the morning the light was dim, pre-dawn. Last Wednesday, the day of his interview, it had been clear weather, with blue skies and sunshine. Now in the overcast everything seemed unfamiliar and strange to him. The Jeep wound through the curves in the road, surrounded by rows of pine trees resembling the ancient colonnades of a lost civilization. This too felt different, oppressive in some way he could not articulate. He had not noticed the other day. His stomach felt as if it were eating itself. Nerves.
	"Relax," he said aloud, "Just breathe, Will. Perfectly normal to be freaked out your first day on the job."
	His reassurance did help, somewhat.
	Soon he emerged from the wooded route and entered a hilly area with offices on both sides of the road. These were concrete and glass cubes about two stories high. Out in front a white van was parked and several workers in coveralls were busy trimming hedges and laying down cedar wood chips around the base of the largest building. Another was spraying down the parking lot with a garden hose, cleaning the debris of their labor. The road he was on ended in a roundabout. There were fancy wooden signs adorned with company logos and arrows telling you which exit to take. He saw the sign for his company and immediately felt weak in his stomach. From the center console he pulled out the bottle of Pepto Bismol he had picked up at a gas station on the way, anticipating this exact moment. He twisted off the cap and downed its entire contents in just a few gulps, feeling the chalky pink liquid work its magic almost immediately.
	By the time he pulled into the parking lot it was still early, a full half hour before he was supposed to meet with Tammy Blankenship in the lobby. He turned off the ignition and sat in the quiet, glancing at his phone every other minute, counting down. This only made him more anxious so he looked outside and watched the people entering the building. Some of these people will be my coworkers, he thought, some of them may turn out to be life-long friends. Who knows? The possibilities for friendship are endless. He realized at once that he was being glib, which he did whenever he was anxious, and admonished himself. Don't be weird today, Will. Normal people don't think like this. Be serious. Take things seriously for once in your life.
	Just then a man passed behind his Jeep. He was overweight and wore a long, black trench coat. On his shoulder he was carrying a leather laptop bag, also black. His face was cleanly shaven but thoroughly pockmarked with acne. He wore unstylish plastic-frame eyeglasses with tinted lenses. But none of those details were what caught his eye. He was moving at the pace of a man wading through a marsh with the obvious aim of prolonging the journey from the parking lot to the office for as long as he could. This made him very sad.
	He looked from the overweight man to others walking from the parking lot to the building. He tried to glean from faces and gaits whether they were happy to be here. Some were like the overweight man, hesitant and sloth-like, but then others walked with purpose and perhaps even enthusiasm. There was one wearing a tailored suit and a Hitler youth haircut. He carried a small briefcase under his arm like a football and was practically shouting to someone via bluetooth earpiece. Salesperson no doubt. But full of life.
	These are my people, he thought as he watched them. This is my world if I walk through those doors in ten minutes. When I walk through those doors, because of course you will. A sense of finality came over him like a cloud. A feeling of death and hopelessness in his heart. Then immediately he put it out of his mind. Today he must be present. Focused. Positive. You only get one chance at a first impression, after all. But where was the boy in him that longed to run off in those woods and climb the biggest tree he could climb? There would have been a time in his life when he might have done just that. And damn the responsibility. But not now. He would never do that now. Yet, when exactly had things changed? This was a new start. A new year. A new job. Apartment in the city. Put all that negativity behind you, Will. Don't dwell inside your head anymore. Don't think those kinds of thoughts. 
	Suddenly, from the corner of his eye, he caught the time. 7:55 a.m. Here we go.
	He got out of the Jeep, manila folder in hand, shirt tucked, pants righted, hair patted down, and began the twenty-yard journey to the office building. As he approached the tinted glass doors he saw his reflection and noticed how awkward his gait was and wondered if the HR woman was watching him at this moment and thinking the same thing.
	He entered the lobby. The floors were marble with ceilings that stretched three stories high. Consequently every sound you made here was magnified tenfold. He hesitated just inside the door until he recognized Tammy Blankenship near the elevators. She called him over with an enthusiastic get-over-here gesture, positively beaming.
	"Well, good morning to you! How was your drive in?"
	"Long," he said, laughing, "But okay."
	She nodded.
	"The commutes are killer in these parts. But we do the best we can. You're coming up 400, correct? I'll email you some shortcuts only the locals know."
	"That would be awesome."
	He handed her the manila envelope with all the paperwork inside and then they took the lobby elevator to the second floor. Along the way she explained.
	"Second floor is IT and development. Third floor is executive, marketing, and HR. First is support and sales."
	"Good to know."
	On the second floor they entered a wide open room, the entire floor really, filled with rows and rows of gray cubicles. The smell of coffee and breakfast sandwiches was thick in the air. To his left he saw floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking the parking lot where he had just come from. There was a buzz of activity, people walking past in a hurry, a group huddled around a monitor, another group in a meeting room drawing on the whiteboard. It was exciting. Like something you wanted to be a part of and contribute to. And he did. Now that he was here. All the anxiety of his commute and waiting in the parking lot had dissapated. This is where he belonged.
	Tammy showed him the break room, the bathrooms, introduced him to the IT department, and showed him where the meeting rooms were and how to access them with the keycard. He took this opportunity to inform her his keycard had not worked at the entrance gate.
	"Oh, shoot," she said, apologetic, "I reminded them to get that done before today. Once I'm done here I will pay a visit to security. It will get done by the end of today or heads will roll. You can bet on that!"
	Next he was shown his cubicle. It sat on a corner near a lot of foot traffic, adjacent to the bathrooms. There was a large monitor and a docked laptop, but little else, in the work space. He noticed the computer was logged on and open to a window with a running script.
	"Here's where I will leave you," she said, "Chen Lu will be over in a few minutes. You remember him from your interview. He's the tech lead of DevOps and will be your immediate supervisor. He'll take you through the next steps and get you set up with all that whiz-bang stuff."
	She gestured to the laptop.
	"This is your computer but hold off before doing anything with it, since I believe they are still using it to run build scripts. Normally we'd have a fresh system for you to use, but unfortunately the previous developer was unable to complete a knowledge transfer before she quit and we've had to leave this system like it was until we're sure we got everything we need off of it. One of the first things you'll be doing is automating the build process, in fact, if I heard it right from Chen."
	She trailed off as if losing her train of thought and there was a moment of uncomfortable silence which he felt responsible to fill.
	"Sounds like you guys were left high and dry."
	She stopped and looked at him, her eyes probing, and a little bit concerned.
	"Did they not say anything to you? During the interview I mean? I had thought they would've at least mentioned the situation to you, before you started."
	Instantly he regretted saying anything at all. That was just like him, to be too familiar with people he barely knew, about things he knew nothing about.
	"Well no. I mean, I don't think so. This is the first time I've heard about a situtation."
	She nodded and gave him a reassuring smile, seeing his confusion and bewilderment.
	"Well, maybe it's not my place to say. Don't worry about it. Anyway, Chen Lu will be here after the morning standup. Just make yourself comfortable. Help yourself to some coffee or whatever you do for breakfast. And once again, welcome to the company. We are thrilled to have you on board!"
	She left. He sat down in the chair of his cubicle. Swiveled it from side to side. Adjusted the height. It was no Aeron, but whatever. He went through all the desk drawers. All were empty except for a couple of paper binders, an old pen, a box of chamomile tea and some napkins and a spork. Then he glanced at the monitor and watched the script running, trying to decipher what it was doing but the output was scrolling by too fast. His inclination would have been to poke around on the laptop but he was hesitant after what Tammy had told him. So he sat back, pulled out his phone, and surfed the web.
	Soon Chen Lu arrived at the cubicle and shook his hand, welcoming him to the team. They were on familiar terms since the interview. The first thing Chen did was show him what scripts they run on the build system (his laptop). But Chen made no comment or reference to the previous developer, Abigail, who Tammy had mentioned somewhat mysteriously.
	Chen explained to him that his first job would be to fully automate the script and deploy it to cloud servers, instead of a single laptop, so it could be scaled as needed. Not to mention the bus factor of having the entire build process running on a developer's machine, which was never intended but it just happened that way because of prioritization. This all made sense to him, he had seen even worse build systems in his time, and he saw no reason at the moment to probe any deeper with questions about the previous developer.
	Afterwards, they walked a few rows over and he was introduced him to the rest of the DevOps team. There were three others, including Chen: Steve Kauffman, Gayle Mathers, and Byron Smith. Now he made four. Chen suggested they all meet at the elevators at noon for lunch at the cafeteria.
