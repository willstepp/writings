One

  At the entrance was a gray box with a white panel and a glowing red dot on top. He had observed the driver ahead of him press a keycard to the panel, at which point the dot turned green and the gate lifted, allowing the BMW to pass through. Now it was his turn. He put the Jeep into park and fumbled through a manila folder on the passenger seat. After a brief moment of panic he found the keycard paper-clipped to his W4, held it up to the panel, noticing as he did the growing line of cars behind him, now backed into the main road. The red dot blinked twice but did not turn green, as it had for the BMW, and the gate did not open for him.
  He sighed.
  "Of course it doesn't work. Why would it?"
  From the line there were impatient beeps and honks. He attempted the keycard once again to no effect, and then gestured in frustration towards the box. Then, just as he was about to u-turn out of line and phone Tammy Blankenship from HR, he noticed in the rear-view an attractive woman in a pencil skirt approaching him. Around her neck she wore a retractable badge with a keycard inside. When she reached the pox she held her own badge up to the panel. The dot turned green and the gate lifted.
  "Sorry about that," he said, "First day."
  But the woman was already headed back to her car, without so much as a glance in his direction, and responded to his lame apology with a quick, "Naw you good", which for some reason rubbed him the wrong way. But the gate was open.
  As he drove under the raised arm and entered the technology park, slits of rain appeared on the windshield. The sky was thick with dark clouds, and though it was 7:30 in the morning, the daylight was muted. Pre-dawn. Last Wednesday, the day of his interview, it had been clear, with blue skies and sunshine. Now in the overcast everything seemed unfamiliar and strange to him.
  The Jeep wound through the curves in the road, surrounded by rows of high pine trees resembling an ancient colonnade. This too felt different, oppressive in some way he could not articulate. There was an empty feeling in his stomach, an ache. Nerves, he thought.
  "Relax, Will," he said aloud, "Just breathe. Perfectly normal to feel freaked out your first day."
  That did help, somewhat.
  Soon he came to the first area of offices. These were concrete and glass cubes about two stories high. Out in front a white van was parked and several workers in coveralls were busy trimming hedges and laying down cedar wood chips around the base of the largest building. Another was spraying down the parking lot with a garden hose, cleaning off the debris of their labor.
  The road he was on ended in a roundabout. There were fancy wooden signs adorned with company logos and arrows telling you which exit to take. He saw the sign for his company and immediately felt weak in his stomach. From the center console he pulled out the bottle of Pepto Bismol he had picked up at a gas station on the way, anticipating this exact moment. He twisted off the cap and downed its entire contents in just a few gulps, feeling the chalky pink liquid work its magic almost immediately.
  By the time he pulled into the parking lot at his building it was still early, a full half hour before he was supposed to meet the HR lady in the lobby. He turned off the ignition and sat in the quiet, glancing at his phone every other minute, counting down. This only made him more anxious so he looked outside and watched the people entering the building.
  Some of these people will be my coworkers, he thought, some of them may turn out to be life-long friends. Who knows? The possibilities are endless. He grinned and realized at once that he was being too glib, even for his own internal monologue. Normal people don't think thoughts like this, Will. Be serious. Take things seriously for once in your life.
  An overweight man caught his eye. He wore a long, black trench coat and a tan fedora. He was carrying a leather laptop bag. His face was cleanly shaven. He wore unstylish metal-rimmed glasses with thick lenses. But none of these details were what caught his eye. The man was walking just about as slow as a person could walk and still be considered to be walking, and not shuffling. Or maybe he was shuffling. What was obvious was that he wanted nothing more than to prolong the journey from his car to the office. And this made him very anxious. And sad.
  He looked from the overweight man to others. He tried to tell from their faces or their walk whether or not they enjoyed their work or dreaded it. Some walked with purpose, completely opposite to the overweight man. One man, in a tailored suit and a Hitler youth haircut, carried a small briefcase under his arm and was speaking at high volume to someone in his bluetooth earpiece. A salesperson no doubt. But full of life.
  These are my people now, he thought. This is the world I am joining if I walk through those doors in ten minutes. When I walk through those doors. A sense of finality overcame him. A feeling of loss. A hopeless feeling. Then immediately, sensing that mood, he put it out of his mind. He needed to be present, focused, positive. You only get one chance at a first impression after all. But where was that part of him that longed to run off in those woods he passed on the road inside? To climb trees all day? There would have been a time when he would have done that. But not now. Now is serious business time. Yet when exactly had it changed?
  This was a new start. A new year. New job. Apartment in the city. Put all that negativity behind you, Will, he told himself. Don't dwell inside your head anymore. Don't think those kinds of thoughts. Then, from the corner of his eye, he caught the time.
  7:55 a.m. 
  Here we go.
  Outside the Jeep, manila folder in hand, shirt tucked, pants righted, hair patted down, he too began his journey to the office building. There was nothing special about it. As he approached the tinted glass doors he saw his reflection and noticed how awkward his gait was and wondered if the HR lady was watching him at this moment and thinking the same thing.
  He entered the lobby. The floors of the lobby were marble with ceilings three stories high. Consequently every sound you made was magnified ten fold. He hesitated just inside, until he saw Tammy Blankenship near the elevators. She called him over with an enthusiastic get-over-here gesture, positively beaming.
  "Well good morning!" she said, "How was your drive in?"
  "Long. But okay."
  She laughed and nodded with understanding.
  "The commutes are killer. But we do the best we can. You're coming up 400, correct? I can show you some shortcuts."
  "That would be great."
  They took the elevator to the second floor.
  "Second is development and IT. Third is executive, HR, and marketing. First is support and sales."
  "Okay, cool. Good to know." 
  On the second floor they entered an open space, the entire floor really, filled with gray cubicles. The smell of coffee and egg and sausage breakfast sandwiches was thick in the air. To his left he saw floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking the parking lot where he had just come from. There was a buzz of activity in the air, people walking by in a hurry, a group huddled around a monitor. It felt exciting. Like something you want to be a part of. And he did. Now that he was here. All the anxiety of his commute and waiting in the parking lot was gone. This is where he belonged.
  She showed him the break room, the bathrooms, introduced him to the IT department, and showed him where the meeting rooms were and how to access them with the keycard. He took this opportunity to inform her his keycard had not worked at the gate to the technology park.
  "Oh, shoot. I told them to get that done before today. Before the end of the day it will be done. I will make it happen or heads will roll. You can bet on that!"
  Next he was shown his cubicle, on a corner with a lot of foot traffic, near the QA department. There was a large monitor and a docked laptop, but little else, in the area. He noticed the computer was logged on and open to a window with a running script.
  "Here's where I have to leave you," she said, "Chen will be over in a few minutes. You remember him from your interview. He'll be your immediate supervisor and he'll show you the ropes and get you set up with all that technical stuff."
  She gestured to the laptop. 
  "This is your computer, but better wait before doing anything with it since I believe they still use it to run build scripts. Normally we would have a fresh computer for you to use, but unfortunately Abigail was unable to do a knowledge transfer before she left, so we've had to leave her system like it was, until we're sure we got everything we need off of it. One of the first things you'll be doing is automating the build process, in fact, if I heard it right."
  "Sounds like Abigail left you guys high and dry."
  Suddenly she stopped and looked at him, her eyes probing.
  "Did they not say anything to you? During the interview I mean? I had thought they would."
  He instantly regretted saying anything at all. That was just like him, to be too familiar with people he barely knew, in situations he knew nothing about.
  "Well, no. I mean. I don't think so. This is the first time I've heard of any of this."
  She nodded and gave him a reassuring smile, seeing his confusion and embarrassment.
  "Well, maybe it's not my place to say. Don't worry about it. Anyway, Chen will be here soon. Just make yourself comfortable. Help yourself to some coffee or whatever you do for breakfast. And once again, welcome, we are so glad to have you here!"
  She departed. He sat in the chair of his cubicle. It was no Aeron, but whatever. The desk drawers were empty except for a box of chamomile tea and some napkins and a spork. He glanced at the script which was running on the monitor and tried to see what was going on but the output was scrolling too fast. His first inclination would have been to poke around on the system but now he was hesitant. Instead he pulled out his phone and checked his email.
  Not long after that Chen Lu arrived at the cubicle and shook his hand, welcoming him to the team. The first thing he did was show him what scripts they run on the build system. He made no comment about Abigail, who Tammy Blankenship had mentioned, as the previous person in this role. He explained to him that his first job would be to fully automate the script and deploy it to cloud servers, so it could be scaled as needed. This all made sense to him and he saw no reason at the time to probe any deeper with questions.
    Chen introduced him to the rest of the DevOps team. There were three total, including Chen. And now he made four. He suggested they all meet up for lunch, get to know on another, so around noon they all met at the elevators and walked the path to A building, where there was a cafeteria that fed the entire technology park.
