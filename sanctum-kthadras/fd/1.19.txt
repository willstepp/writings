July 14

This will be my last entry.

I am back at home, in my mother's bedroom, sitting at the desk in the corner. My sister has never turned the power back on, so I am writing by candlelight, like some princess in a castle. I've spent the last hour flipping through my old entries. You know what's funny? I don't recognize the Abigail I was before. The one with the family and the career. The Abigail who was paralyzed from grief over the death of her mother. I do remember that time in my life, of course. I'm not insane. And I do remember my mother, and my sorrow when she passed. But her memory is distant. Faint. Like a pair of shoes I once owned. Fondly remembered, but meaningless.

What this journal has become, at the end of the day, is the record of a mystery without explanation. The mystery of the man who lives in the room behind the Kroger on Ponce de Leon. You might think I'm crazy, but I have a feeling he's the one responsible for all the horrible shit that's happened to me since that evening in May. I can't explain how I know that, it doesn't really make sense, but I know. Don't get my wrong. I'm not angry. Not anymore I'm not. And I don't think I'm blameless, either. I take full responsibility for my actions. This journal is a confession too. But ultimately, this is the only way I know how to reveal the truth about what happened. Now that he's gone.

After the events of July 2nd, Garvey took down the listing from Craigslist. We pooled the money we made and scored an ounce of good shit. It would last us a month if we paced ourselves. So we got high. And stayed high. On the drugs the pain of my injuries didn't matter. It's not that the pain went away. It just didn't matter. I remember dropping a plate on the floor and picking it up. Garvey looked horrified and said, "Ain't that your broken arm?" I looked at my arm and laughed. "Yeah, I guess it is." He asked me if it hurt, and I had to think about it for a moment. I said yeah, and we both laughed.

We never slept. We watched TV, YouTube. We talked conspiracy theories, or just sat and stared out the window. And whenever we felt the anxiety of the comedown, we'd hit it again, and be soaring for another day or so. Another thing we never did was clean the room. It was disgusting. There was trash and dirty clothes strewn all over the floor. Cigarette butts and ashes piled on the nightstand. At night we heard roaches scurrying in old takeout boxes. Or maybe it was rats. We never found out.

After a week of being holed up in the room, Garvey started getting on my last nerve. He had become paranoid that somebody was going to find out about the robberies. "We were too nice to that one guy," he said, "We should have roughed him up, put the fear of God into him." He was convinced the guy was going to place an anonymous phone call to the police. So every few minutes he would be at the window, scanning the parking lot for cops. At the trash bins he found some wood scraps and brought it inside and boarded the window in the bathroom, as best as he could with no tools. He made so much racket doing that, at two in the morning, our neighbors beat on the walls. So I went off on him.

"You're gonna get the cops called on us for doing that stupid shit, you dumbass!"

He called me a rotten bitch and slapped me across the face. And that really set me off. I scratched in his face and kicked him in the balls.

"I hate your fucking guts!" he said.

I told him I wish I never met him and he shut himself in the bathroom and didn't come out for an hour. But it was fine. After that we watched a documentary on YouTube about the whaling industry in China, and how it was connected to 9/11.

The more we stayed in the more frequent our arguments. The thing was Garvey was too paranoid to go out. And with my injuries he completely forbid me to go out. When we got hungry he walked to the gas station and picked up some arepas. That was the only time I had to myself. In those moments I could really breathe. I could relax. And whenever he returned and I heard the doorknob turn there was a sick feeling in my stomach. Sometimes I was so sick I lost my appetite altogether. Then I had to listen to a lecture about not wasting our money if we didn't have to. Sometimes he was as bad as my mother. I swear.

It was hot. Even for July it was hot. The window air conditioner unit wasn't good enough to keep the room cool during the hottest time of the day. So what I did was pull the table and chair over to the window and prop it open. Then I would sit there and just look out the window over the parking lot. That was how I spent my afternoons. What we really needed was a fan. Just a cheap box fan we could stick in the window for circulation. I asked Garvey if he could get one but he said we couldn't afford that right now.

"Just do like I do and ignore the heat. You get used to it after awhile. Look at me, I don't even sweat no more."

As he said that I could see his undershirt was drenched in sweat. But I didn't say anything. Sometimes it wasn't worth the effort. I just ignored him and went back to the window. It was so uncomfortable. With the heat and the sweat. And being cooped up with the same person for nearly two weeks. Inside I felt this gnawing. That same gnawing hunger I had felt for so long it was like background noise. It didn't even bother me anymore. Except when it did.

All that bullshit continued in the same way until today, my irritation rising, the gnawing inside getting stronger, until something had to give.

In order to block out Garvey and the heat and the stench of our nasty room, all of which was really getting to me - I sat at the open window and stared across the lot at the pregnant girl who lived with her Mexican boyfriend. 

If I'm honest, I was jealous of her. It feels good to write that. Some light of truth in this darkness. I was jealous of her and her boyfriend, who clearly loved her and kissed her every night when he got home from work. I was jealous of their mutual love, and of their material possessions, the nice chairs and decorations she hung outside their room. The succulents and potted plants. But most of all I was jealous of the unborn child in her womb. A child that would be loved and give love, unconditionally. It didn't seem fair to me that she had so much, and me so little.

She was outside, sitting in the chair, in the heat, with a tiny oscillating fan on a table next to her. She had a glass of lemonade and a sandwich and was reading a magazine. Whenever the fan turned in her direction it blew her hair across her face and she absently flipped it behind her ears. For some reason this infuriated me.

"Just tie your hair back, you fucking cunt!" I said.

Garvey sat up in bed. He had gone so long without sleep that he was nodding off during the daytime.

"What'd you say? Tie my hair back?"

"Nothing," I said, "Go back to sleep."

Not long after that she got a text. Then she picked up all her things and brought them inside. Ten minutes later a hatchback pulled up with a girl inside. The car honked and she came outside, wearing a sun dress and a large pair of sunglasses pushed up on her head. She got in the car and they drove off.

It was then I got the idea. At the time I thought it was a good idea, a very good idea, but it wasn't. It really wasn't.

From the nightstand I grabbed Garvey's pocket knife. I put on some jeans and some flip flops and walked outside. It was the afternoon and in the sunlight I winced and covered my eyes. I looked down at my arms, pockmarked with scabs and ashen in color. I felt like a vampire recently emerged from the tomb. Hyper aware of my surroundings, I looked around to make sure nobody was watching me.

What I knew from days upon days of observing them, was that my neighbors hid a key to their room underneath a green and blue glazed pot which sat upon the ledge of their window sill, holding the smallest succulent. I walked across the hot asphalt to the area in front of my neighbors room. I raised the pot and saw the room key, and took it. Hesitating for only a moment, I used the key and entered their room.

It was strange inside. The layout of the room and the furniture was entirely the same as the room Garvey and me shared, except reversed. What was different was how clean it was. And how it smelled. The walls were bright. The carpet was soft. Don't get me wrong, this entire weekly-rate complex was a shithole, but somehow she had made their room homelike, a cocoon in the middle of a wasteland. The wooden furniture had been polished. The sheets and blankets on the bed had been washed with fragrant detergent. In the kitchenette, on the counter where Garvey and me kept our paraphernalia, they had a row of small picture frames, with photos of their family. In the dresser she found their clothes neatly washed and folded, separated into drawers for underwear and socks, jeans and pants, and shirts.

I walked into the kitchen and opened the small refrigerator. Inside was a fucking cornucopia of food. It looked like something out of a painting from the Renaissance, I swear to God. There were vegetables and fruits, tomatoes, peppers, carrots, lettuce, oranges, bananas, grapes. There was meat, chicken, ground beef, chorizo, bacon. At the bottom of the fridge was a pot of spaghetti and meatballs. I pulled it out and took a fork from the drawer and wolfed it down. I wasn't even hungry. Or, maybe I didn't realize how hungry I was.

When I turned around I saw her. The pregnant girl was standing at the door, her key in the doorknob, sunglasses on. She startled when she noticed me. She screamed and then became quiet. Calm even. She closed the door and put the keys into her purse. She did not look at all afraid. I said nothing, holding the pot of spaghetti, fork in my hand.

"You can finish it," she said, "I don't mind."

I continued to eat, watching her, not responding. She set her purse and a shopping bag on the bed and stood there, looking at me. She smiled warmly.

"You are the woman who lives across from us."

I said nothing.

"It's okay," she said, "I'm not mad. Really, you are welcome to our food. To be honest I have been worried for you. Ever since that night a couple weeks ago. I wanted to call an ambulance for you. But I'm glad you're okay now."

I set down the pot on the island, and rested the fork on the lid. It slipped and fell to the counter with a clang. I could see it startle the girl. But I pretended not to notice.

"Gregorio, my husband, told me not to intervene, when I told him about you later that night. But I was raised by my mother to help those who are in need. Don't you think that's a better way to be?"

From the moment onward it was like I was watching the movie of my life. That same sensation I had experienced before, when I followed Rabbit into the woods behind the McDonald's. It was the same. I watched the girl, in whose eyes I now saw terror. I watched myself, opening the pocket knife, and flashing the blade in front of me. I watched the blade enter her pregnant belly, spilling dark blood onto that clean carpet. I watched the evisceration of the fetus, torn from the womb. I watched as the girl went pale, her eyes in horror and disbelief. She collapsed onto the bed and clutched the abortion.

I looked down and saw my clothes were drenched in blood. My arms and hands completely soaked, as if painted, in red.

The next thing I remember was the parking lot. Stumbling across it, seeing my movements as if through a tunnel. Not feeling anything, but knowing that the person I was observing felt utter rage and a loss of control.

The next thing I remember is standing in the shower, my clothes on the tile floor, seeping rivulets of blood into the cracks. I remember the blood washing down the drain. Feeling the water running down my body. Feeling clean.

I remember sirens, and the flashing of red and blue lights, outside our window. Shouting. Commotion.

Garvey woke up and went to the window.

"What the hell is this?" he said.

He flung back the curtain and I saw rows of police cars and an ambulance. There was a growing crowd at the edge of the yellow tape, standing on their tiptoes in order to see the carnage within. But the door to the room was closed.

At that moment a pickup truck pulled into the spot where it always parked, just in front of their apartment. The husband got out of the truck, his work clothes dusty, and forced his way through the group of police officers. A man in a long coat emerged from the door and placed his hand on the shoulder of the husband, and stopped him from going inside the room. The husband was told something. He went pale and dropped to his knees, unable to stand.

Garvey turned to me, in shock, and then in horror. He looked me up and down. I stood there naked, clean, but my hands were still stained with her blood. In my right hand I still carried his pocket knife.

"What have you done?" he said. His eyes went soft and tears welled in his eyes. All the hardness and macho toughness he had always projected had left him. In its place was the weakness of a child.

"Oh my God, Abigail," he said, turning back to the scene outside, "What did you do to that poor girl?"
