Sixteen

  It was past five. To his west, the evening sun hovered just above the forested hills of the Appalachians, casting long shadows from the billboards and passing vehicles onto the road in front of him. Traffic was sparse. He was in West Virginia, headed northbound on Interstate 79. He had been driving for eight hours straight. His back ached and his feet were sore, but he had decided not to stop until he reached his destination.
    He saw the sign for Exit 96, South Weston, and put on his blinker. From the exit he turned north and drove on a winding county road that ran alongside a river on his left, until he reached US Highway 19, which took him the rest of the way into the city of Weston, a rural town with a population of a few thousand people. He passed through a residential area and entered the downtown. When he saw the sign for "Historic Asylum Tours" and an arrow pointing down E Second St, he pulled into the parking lot of Saint Patrick Catholic Church on the corner.
  Next to him on the passenger seat was an aluminum baseball bat and a canvas satchel. Inside the satchel was an envelope from the bank. Inside the envelope was eighty-five hundred dollars. He had taken it from his savings account, which now held a balance of exactly five-hundred and twenty seven dollars and eighty-eight cents. To buy the book was going to cost him nearly everything he had. Was it worth that much? He had no way to know for sure. But the promise of answers to his questions was too strong for him to turn away now. Also, he was sure that if the book turned out to be real, he could convince Susan Burrows and her colleagues to buy it from him and get his money back. 
  If.
  He grabbed the phone from cubby on the center console and reviewed the instructions he had been sent:
  
  71 Asylum Dr, Weston, WV 26452
  Jan 23 6:45pm
  Park at Swisher Feed
  Cross street
  Building with blue door
  Wait inside
  Bring money
  Come alone
  
  Not much to go on. Before he left he had looked up a map of the area and found the Saint Patrick church, which was a walkable distance from where he had been told to park, at the Swisher Feed and Supply store. It felt safer that way.
  On the sidewalk an old woman walked past the Jeep. She was hunched over and carried a little hand purse. Her eyes cut over to him and he smiled and nodded at her, but her eyes went straight ahead without acknowledging him at all. She stopped at the traffic light and crossed over to the other side and went into a place called Deb's Diner.
  This downtown area was a lot like the one where he grew up in Georgia: Vacant streets and old buildings, most of them boarded up or in disuse. The few businesses there were felt temporary, as if they could shutter any time, with dusty window displays and ill-conceived signage.
  The only thing this town seemed to have going for it was the asylum, which he had also researched beforehand on Wikipedia.
  
The Trans-Allegheny Lunatic Asylum, subsequently the Weston State Hospital, was a Kirkbride psychiatric hospital that was operated from 1864 until 1994 by the government of the U.S. state of West Virginia, in the city of Weston. Weston State Hospital got its name in 1913 which was used while patients occupied it, but was changed back to its originally commissioned, unused name, the Trans-Allegheny Lunatic 	Asylum, after being reopened as a tourist attraction.

Designed by Gothic Revival and Tudor Revival styles by Baltimore architect Richard Snowden Andrews, it was constructed from 1858â€“1881. Originally designed to hold 250 people, it became overcrowded in the 1950s with 2,400 patients. It was forcibly closed in 1994 due to changes in patient treatment. The hospital was bought by Joe Jordan in 2007, and is opened for tours and other events to raise money for its restoration. The hospital's main building is claimed to be one of the largest hand-cut stone masonry buildings in the United States, and the second largest hand-cut sandstone building in the world, with the only bigger one being in the Moscow Kremlin. As Weston Hospital Main Building, it was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1990.
  
  At a quarter after six he shouldered the satchel, grabbed the bat, and locked up the Jeep. He crossed the street going north, past Deb's Diner, and walked over a bridge, under which flowed the same river he had passed on the way into town. By now the sun had dropped below the mountains and the sky was darkening into twilight. It was freezing cold and his breath was visible in the air.
  He passed a local grocery store called the Shop n Save and the Fisher Auto Parts store before seeing the red sign for Swisher Feed and Supply. On his left he saw the wide open yard in front the asylum, dotted with bare trees. There was a short black gate around the circumference of the grounds. The asylum seemed out of place inside a rural town in the hills of West Virginia, so stately and austere. It would have felt more at home in Victorian England over a hundred years ago.
  At the feed store he spotted a gravel road across the street. It ran behind the asylum grounds. There were a few buildings which looked to house public services. He crossed over, having to wait for a few cars to pass. He felt conspicuous holding the bat and did the best he could to hide it under his arm. On the road the same black gate was all that separated him from the grounds. But there were no buildings here. Ahead of him he saw a metal gate across the road. There were some orange construction barriers on either side of the gate. He assumed its purpose was to prevent vehicle thru traffic, but there was nothing to keep a pedestrian out.
  Beyond the gate the road continued. Here the gravel stopped and there only was old, broken pavement. The grass was overgrown. After glancing at the time on his cell phone, he quickened his pace. He approached a few buildings. They looked old. Laid with sandstone bricks they were no doubt from the time of the original construction. The doors had been painted white at one time, but were now yellowed with age and flaking off, exposing the wood or metal underneath. None of the doors were blue.
  Eventually he came to the end of the grounds, where there was another gate and orange barriers. He turned around, confused. He looked at the time and saw he only had another five minutes until he was supposed to be meeting for the exchange.
  "God fucking damnit," he said aloud, "Why does shit like this always happen to me? Of course there's no blue door. Fucking of course. Why would there be? That would be too simple."
  He returned the way he had come, looking hard at all the doorways, which was becoming more difficult in the growing darkness. And then, about in the middle of the rows, he spotted a tiny building away from the main row. It looked like a shed that may have been used to store landscaping and gardening equipment. There were double wooden doors on the front, but on the side was a squat door, blue in color. He waded through the tall grass and stood in front of it, hesitating. He pulled the flashlight from his pocket and shone it over the surface to make sure it really was blue, and it was, but then he noticed something else. At this distance, he could see there was a symbol scratched into the door, like it had been etched with the blade of a knife, sloppy but perfectly recognizable. It was the symbol from the pendant. He took a deep breath, attempting to calm his pounding heart, and turned the knob.
  The door opened into a cavernous space the size of an auditorium. The ceilings were high, with exposed wooden rafters, some rotted and fallen in. The walls were mottled with peeled paint, mildew, and creeper vines. Along the walls were windows, opaque with dust and grime, which admitted no light. The floors were marble, but were completely covered with debris, old hospital equipment, and broken plaster from the walls and ceiling. The air was stale and filled with dust, which he had stirred up himself when entering. On either side of the space were open corridors, leading into darkness. It was clear this was some kind of central lobby of a much larger structure.
  In the center of the room was a raised platform, upon which was the statue of a figure about twelve feet tall. But it was obscured in the dim light of the space, so he couldn't make out what it was from where he was standing. He went around the front of the platform and gazed upwards at it. But even up close the figure remained inscrutable. Its shape was vaguely humanoid, having a head, torso, and two arms and legs, but beyond that he could tell nothing about it or what it was meant to represent.
  He walked towards the entrance, where two enormous (wooden?) doors had fallen from their hinges across the doorway. Between the gaps where doors had fallen he saw a courtyard overgrown with briars and plants he could not place and bathed in a hellish glow from a fire he could not see.
  Behind him was a crash and crumbling sound. His heart jumped because he knew what the sound was before he even turned around. And it was. The figure had come down from the raised platform and was headed towards him. He fell backwards and sliced him arm on some rocky debris, horrified and paralyzed with fear.
  To his right was a corridor. It was the only avenue open to him, so he took it. He scrambled to his feet and swung the aluminum bat towards the figure, trying to give himself some time, and took off in the direction of the corridor. He passed by rows of rusted wheelchairs and toppled them in his path. It was impossible to see where he was going, but he ran hard, as hard as he could.
  With a glance backwards he saw the figure was following him. They were in a long hallway, with high ceilings. He had to step carefully to avoid tripping over obstacles in his path. He came to an area with a large wooden nurses station and beyond it another hallway, smaller than this one. In a few seconds he formulated a plan to turn into the hallway and then quickly backwards and dive under the station table, in order to trick it, and go another direction entirely. He didn't even have enough time to hope it would work.
  He waited until he was just past the station and turned abruptly towards the hallway, catching himself against the opposite wall. It took all his strength to maintain the momentum and push off the wall down the hallway, without slowing down, but he managed to do it. Once he was a few feet down the hallway and far enough he thought he would be out of sight from the figure, he planted both feet into the floor and jerked himself backwards, twisting as he landed. He hit the ground with a thud and crawled under the nurse station table.
  As soon as he heard the figure approach and head down the hallway he leapt up and continued back the way he came. But the figure had not been fooled for long and had doubled-back also. He had gained about twenty yards on it and looked behind to see where it was, and not seeing it anywhere, panicked.
  When he turned back around he noticed he could no longer see the corridor stretching in front of him. Instead he was looking at the ceiling with its exposed rafters. At his feet was a window and he reacted quickly to jump over it. He had run up the side of the corridor wall, as if it were part of the floor. Disoriented, his stomach lurched and he threw up, the vomit falling behind him towards the actual floor which was now fifteen feet below him. His legs turned weak and he dropped to his knees, grabbing hold of a lamp on the wall for support. The figure was below, staring up. And then it too ascended the wall. 
  Though he was still dizzy he got to his feet and ran. When he reached the ceiling he kept going and found himself balancing on the rafters. He looked up and saw the checkered marble floor of the corridor, the figure not far behind. Before long he re-entered the central lobby, where he had first arrived. The ceiling rafters were broken and he had to make a jump to the next one. He leapt without thinking and slipped. He managed to grab hold of some wiring that hung down and pulled himself up to the next rafter. Behind him he heard the figure. He turned and saw it running on the ceiling the same as him, balancing on the rafters.
  In the center of the lobby, on the ceiling, was a gigantic brass chandelier, tarnished and water-stained. It hung by a single large chain. He got as close to the chandelier as he could and grabbed hold of it, his plan to swing to the opposite side and hopefully put some distance between them. But as he swung using the entire weight of his body, his legs went out from under him and he lost his grip on the chandelier. He was able to hold on by one hand, dangling from a candlestick limb.
  The figure was upon him, on the other side of the chandelier. It took hold of it and began to rock it back and forth, creating a wide arc that made it very difficult to hold on. And then he felt his grasp slip and it was over. He fell. It was forty feet  to the marble floor. In an instant he accepted that he was going to die and braced himself for the inevitable impact.
  At the last moment he looked down and saw the ground rushing up and then there was darkness and he felt himself still going down. But he was alive, his bones were not broken. He moved his limbs and they moved the same way you move underwater, slow and with resistance. He kicked his legs and they moved the same. Then he realized he was underwater. Or, it was not water, but a liquid of some kind. He breathed in and instantly choked. It tasted of dirt and wood.
