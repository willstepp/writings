June 30

Things are different now. My last entry was over a month ago. Not sure why I even bother with this diary anymore. But Stephen is gone out for cigarettes and I'm bored out of my gourd. 

Last week they fired me. To be perfectly honest I was expecting it, so no surprise there. I mean, the week before that they had handed me an "official warning" on a piece of paper, signed by Tammy, Chen, and Pence. Then last week I only came into work like two days. I gave them a bullshit excuse for the other days, telling them I needed to work from home, but they knew I was lying through my teeth. On a team of five it's easy to tell when somebody isn't pulling their weight. Oh well. My health comes first. And my health isn't good right now. I feel bad all the time. I ache all over. Behind my eyes. In my muscles. In my bones. Everywhere. And the hunger never goes away. That feeling inside of me. No matter what I do. And I just can't work right now. But I believe things will get better soon. I really do believe that.

The day they fired me, Tammy and Chen came to my cubicle. They asked if I would follow them into Tammy's office on the third floor. That was an awkward elevator ride. Neither one of them would look me in the eyes. That's how I knew something was up. In her office Tammy asked me to have a seat. Chen sat in the chair next to me.

"We have to let you go, Abigail," she said, as if she was my best friend, "We had hoped the warning last week would help to get you back on track, but then you only showed up to work two days last week. So unfortunately our hands are tied. We know you're still having a difficult time outside of work, but there's a limit to the sort of behavior the company will accept. Please understand our position here."

She worded everything so I wouldn't get mad at her or Chen. Pretending like it wasn't them doing this to me. Like it wasn't their choice to fire me, but "the company". The more she talked like that the more angry I got. And then she started getting personal.

"You don't look well, Abigail. We're all very worried about you. Chen and me. The others. You've lost a lot of weight in a very short period of time. You have those sores on your arms."

"Nobody's perfect," I said, laughing a little, trying to lighten the mood. Everybody was being super serious. I swear. Tammy looked like she wanted to cry and Chen looked like his mother had just died.

Tammy brought out some pamphlets about alcohol and drug abuse. The kind you get at the clinic. She handed them to me and them clasped her hands around mine.

"Abigail, please get some help. We love you and don't want to see you go down this road. You're a good person and a smart person. You're better than this."

I jerked my hand away from hers and threw those stupid pamphlets onto the desk. Then I told them both to go fuck themselves. They were so patronizing and smug. If they had just been a little nicer to me and not so in-your-face I might have listened to what they had to say. But I couldn't take being condescended to like that. I stormed out of there, slamming the door behind me. I went to my cubicle for my things and got the hell out of that God forsaken place.

Seriously, fuck those assholes. I'll find new work when I'm well again. I don't need that kind of judgement in my life. Why are people like that? Why does everybody thinks they know what's best for you, when they really don't. I got the same shit from Dr. Patel before I fired him. I'll fire everybody. Nobody fires me!

That night I texted Stephen. I asked if he wanted to hang out. He said sure come on over. So I did. Him and a few of his buddies were high on Xanax and weed. They gave me some of that and all my troubles went away. That may be my new favorite thing. After awhile Stephen took me aside and said the guys wanted to have some fun and asked me if I was down with that. At that point I was down for whatever, so I said sure. We went into the bedroom and they undressed me, feeling me all over. I told them to get undressed to and we had a lot of fun. 

Honestly I get lost in those feelings as much as getting high. Men desiring me. Lusting after my body. The more sexual they are with me the better. Whenever they touch me I lose myself completely. It feels like nothing else in the world matters, except for the sensation I am experiencing in that moment. I go to a place inside that feels like a white sand beach on a pink and blue horizon. It is a feeling of serenity and complete fulfillment. I crave that feeling. I only want more of it.

Afterwards we all hung out and watched YouTube. Eventually they left. At the door I saw them handing Stephen money, eyeballing me. I asked him what the money was for and he looked at me with a strange expression on his face and turned away and said, "For you".

This continued over several nights. We never talked about it. But he would text me. Telling me to come over and hang out with some friends. Then we'd get high and then his friends would take me into the bedroom. Stephen stopped coming along. After awhile it became clear to me that these people weren't really his friends at all. They were customers.

He gave me weed, meth, Xanax, Oxy. Whatever I wanted that he had, he gave to me. And I wanted everything. The next week was a haze. He started driving me around to hotel rooms, shitty apartments, parking lots. I'd meet strange men and let them do anything they wanted to me. I didn't care. As long as I was high and as long as they used my body to get me to that place, that white sand beach with the pink and blue horizon, I didn't care at all. A couple times I forgot to take any money from them and Stephen got really upset. He asked me what I thought this was, some game? And I just laughed in his face. 

In my free time I'd post on Craigslist, looking to hook up or for a party and play. Depending on the mood I was in. I did so many things I never thought I would do. The filthier the better. As things went on it took more and more to get me to that place. To keep away the hunger that never went away. So I did it all. Most guys never want to use protection, and have a million excuses why, so I stopped asking. Or asked for more money. When Stephen found out what I was doing he got angry with me, raising his hand in a threatening way.

"Listen to me very carefully," he said, very calmly, but I could tell he was seething with rage, "You are mine. I own you, Abbie. You do not fuck anybody without my permission first. That's how this is going to work. Do you understand me?"

I said, "Yes, master" and laughed in his face. But inwardly I liked the way he was talking to me. It made me feel desired and cared for. And I need that. I realize how fucked up it sounds, but it's the truth, and from now on my thing is always to tell the absolute truth. No more bullshit.

The other day I got a text from Stephen, asking him to meet me at a weekly-rate motel on Buford Highway. When I arrived he was pacing the room. He was geeked out. I could tell he'd been up for days. His eyes were bugging. I asked him about his apartment.

"Those fuckers evicted me. Said I hadn't paid rent in two months. That's bullshit though. I pay my rent. Paid in full, you know what I'm saying?"

He told me he had a plan. He and a bunch of his friends had pooled their money and rented three adjacent rooms at a nice hotel in Buckhead. They were planning to throw a massive party  with a bunch of girls. Advertise the party to some rich business assholes who can't get laid to save their life. Charge a hundred dollars a head. Make some bank. He told me I was one of the girls. His special girl.

"Motherfucker," I told him, "I'm your only girl and I know that. Don't use your bullshit lines on me."

He blew up at me.

"You can't keep talking to me like that, Abbie. You have to respect me. Remember that. I keep you high. I know you lost your job and you're damn sure not walking out on me now. You have it too good. So shut the fuck up and show me some Goddamn respect!"

I did shut up, but inside I told myself, this motherfucker better watch out who he's talking to.

He gave me a hundred dollars and said "Go buy something nice to wear. Something high-class. I need you to look like a million bucks by nine o clock tonight. Don't let me down, baby."

But you only gave me a hundred bucks, asshole, I thought to myself as I walked out the door. Still, I went to the mall and found a little red cocktail dress and some shoes to match. They were on sale. Then I had my hair done. But I had gone over the hundred dollars and put it on a credit card that was still active, even though I hadn't paid the bill in months. I have to say, I looked pretty damn sexy, once I put on some makeup. All dolled-up like that, I think I did look like a million bucks. At least.

Stephen texted a few hours later and told me which hotel to be at. It was a swanky place in Midtown. There was a bar on the roof and I arrived early and hung out at the bar. There were guys all over me, hitting on me, buying me drinks. One guy offered to give me a ride in his BMW and I whispered in his ear, "Why don't you let me give you a ride first?" So I took him by the hand and led him to a little hidden corner just inside, near the elevators. Underneath the staircase. I hiked up my dress and let me take me from behind. He entered me and felt me all over and I went to that place where there is no hunger and no pain. When he finished I asked him for a hundred dollars. He looked at me with disgust and called me a whore. I started screaming in his face, and told him I was going to find security and say he raped me. He got quiet after that and handed me everything in his wallet, which wasn't quite a hundred. But I took it and blew him a kiss as he got into the elevator.

An hour later











The only thing that helps at all is visiting the man in the room. Stephen doesn't believe he exists. He rolls his eyes every time I bring him up. Calls me crazy. But when it's really bad, when the hunger is too much for me to take, I go there, and just seeing him makes it better. It's sad to say but he's the best thing in my life, and I feel so grateful he is there.
