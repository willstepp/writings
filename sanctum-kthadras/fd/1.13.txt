  It was Saturday. 40 degrees. The sky was gray and overcast, but the weather had not predicted any rain. He drove through a congested part of midtown, gas stations, fast food restaurants, strip malls, and then turned down a side street and went past a parking lot filled with brightly-colored food trucks. Then he saw the metal and wood bespoke sign for The Goat Farm and turned right onto the gravel drive, finding a spot to park near the main entrance. 
  The Goat Farm was an arts center which had been built inside a reclaimed industrial complex from the 19th century. The buildings were all rectangular red-brick structures with rows of boarded-up windows or open spaces where windows used to be. Indoors, the spaces had been subdivided into studio workshops for artists and craftspeople of various kinds: blacksmiths, woodworkers, sculptors, painters, stained-glass makers. The layout of the Farm was labyrinthine, with many corridors and courtyards, joined together by small brick tunnel ways. Walking through the complex felt to him like exploring the ruins of the industrial south. The owners had persevered the historical character of the place, to their credit, he thought.
  He followed signs with arrows that read: Occult Talk This Way, and ended up outside a large structure that looked to be an old warehouse. There was an easel out front with a sign.
  
Origins of the Occult: An Introduction to Lesser-Known Belief Systems of the World, and Beyond...

  Below that was a time table of speakers. There were five in total. The person he had come to see was third on the list.

1pm - Dr. Susan Burrows on The Adherents of K'thadras, or Hidden in Plain Sight

  It was now twelve thirty. He went inside and noticed a small table with a stack of books. He picked it up and read the same title as was on the sign out front. The cover was a photograph of interstellar space overlaid with a symmetrical arrangement of various symbols, one of which he recognized as the same pattern on the pendant he now carried in his jacket pocket. 
  He asked a girl near the table how much the book cost and paid for it in cash. Then he found a chair near the back and sat down.
  As he waited he looked around. The ceiling had to be at least thirty feet high, with exposed wooden rafters. There was a chandelier overhead, made from woven wood and grass. Natural light filtered in through open spaces where windows used to be. There were five rows of folding chairs, arranged with an aisle down the middle, as in a wedding. In front of the seating was an old-fashioned lectern with a table next to it. On the table was a small projector, a pitcher of water, and a copy of the same book he held in his hands. Behind the table was a large projection screen, upon which was the final slide of the previous talk, or so he guessed, since it said:
  
27. The End (And remember kids, don't believe everything you're told!)

  It was not a large turnout. There were a dozen or so attendees when Susan Burrows came up the center aisle and stood behind the lectern. His first thought was she was much shorter than he imagined. She looked like an old hippie, wearing an earth-tone wrap top, jeans, and bright purple New Balance sneakers. Her hair was in a messy bun and her glasses were pushed up onto her head.
