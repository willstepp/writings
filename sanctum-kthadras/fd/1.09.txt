May 16

It's been a very rough few days, but things are finally looking up. They really are. I feel so much at peace within my heart that I just had to tell somebody. Shout it from the rooftops! But it's late now and nobody's around, so I guess I'll have to settle for a diary entry instead. To start, let me go back to the day after my collapse at work.

That morning I woke up early, before the sun was up, and made a pot of coffee. I drank two cups along with a couple slices of toast with butter and strawberry preserves. Well, four slices. I went back for seconds. I was completely famished. Which was a little weird, because I had eaten a very large dinner the night before: a twelve-piece chicken strip meal with four biscuits, mashed potatoes, and cole slaw. That meal is meant for families. But I didn't stress about it too much. I figured it was my body needing fuel to recuperate from the previous day. And from the lack of sleep. That always makes me overeat.

My appointment with Dr. Patel was at noon, so I had the whole morning. I texted Chen that I would be coming in after lunch. A few minutes later he texted back a thumbs up and a smiley face. The rest of the morning I washed clothes, cleaned the kitchen, and caught up on some shows. Then I took a shower and washed my hair, which I had been neglecting all week.

Needless to say he was not happy with me. I confessed all that had happened. Quitting the Lexapro cold turkey, the early morning call to the ambulance, collapsing at work. With each thing I said, his face got redder and redder.

"Why didn't you listen to me, Abigail? I get so tired of you amateur physicians reading nonsense on the internet and deciding you know better than I do."

"I apologize. I resumed the medication. Of course."

"I'm trying to help you, Abigail!"

"I know you are."

"But you're not helping me to help you."

"I'm sorry. I will listen from now on. I learned my lesson. Believe me."

"If you don't, I can no longer be your doctor. That's just the way it is. I can't be held responsible for your recklessness. I won't be."

So, yeah. I suppose I deserved that dressing down, especially considering what happened. Still, I'm not some mindless robot. I don't just do what people tell me to do. I am taking the Lexapro for now, but I still plan to ween off of it. And I think I'm going to start looking for another psychiatrist. I think I'll have to. No man is going to tell me what to do with my body. I'll take his advice, but it's my body.

This is where things got a bit weird. I'm a little embarrassed to write all this down to be honest. Not sure if I want a permanent record for every little thing. But since I'm already writing, screw it.

On the way home from the doctor's office, I got that intense hunger sensation I had felt the other day at the pond. It came on so quickly, and with such a force, that I had to pull over until it passed. Except it didn't pass this time. I'm not sure how to describe the feeling. It feels like a vast opening, or hollowness, inside of me. Like a cavern. The nearest word I can think of to describe the feeling would be "hunger". But that's not quite it. Not quite. I don't think I'm making very much sense, because it did make me hungry. But that was only my body's reaction to it. The only way my body knew how to interpret it, and it did make me hungry. My mouth began to salivate.

A couple blocks from where I was parked, I saw a sign for Golden Corral. That was enough to get me going. I sped over there and went inside. I ordered the buffet and sat down in an unoccupied corner near the back. The waitress brought my drink and told to me help myself.

My first plate was stacked four levels deep: Macaroni and cheese, mashed potatoes, green beans, sliced roast beef, chicken wings, tomato and cucumber salad, two yeast rolls, and cornbread. It was gone in five minutes.

My second plate was stacked higher than the last: Spaghetti with meat sauce, two chicken tacos, hash brown casserole, three pork ribs, a sirloin steak, a green salad with tomatoes, mushrooms, onions, and cheese, topped with ranch. And two yeast rolls. That one took me longer, maybe ten minutes.

Next was dessert. I ate a bowl of chocolate-vanilla swirl ice cream topped with hot fudge and walnuts. I ate a fudge-covered brownie, a large chocolate chip cookie, strawberry jello with cool whip, a bowl of vanilla pudding.

I was full. My waitress had refilled my coke and set down the ticket. But the weird thing is, I didn't feel full. Not at all. When I say I was full, I mean I could tell my stomach was literally stuffed with the food I had just shoveled into it. But the feeling of fullness, that was not there. It was the same hollow feeling, just as intense as before. But I couldn't eat anymore. And I was still hungry. My body was telling me I was hungry. It was like what I imagine going crazy would feel like. It was like going crazy and being helpless to stop it.

I did something I now regret. Something I swore I would never do. There were some bathrooms near the exit. I went into a stall in the woman's bathroom and put my fingers down my throat and gagged. All the food came back up, into the toilet. I saw stars at the corners of my eye. I flushed and then did it again. Until all the food I had just eaten was out of me. I washed my face in the sink, rinsed out my mouth with water, and returned to my seat.
