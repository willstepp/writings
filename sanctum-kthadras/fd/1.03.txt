Three

  A week passed. During that time he settled into a workable routine, awake at seven, on the road by seven thirty, office by eight fifteen, coffee while checking mail until eight thirty, daily standup at nine, work until lunchtime, lunch at the cafeteria, work until five, evening commute, home by seven, dinner, tv, movie, or game, then bed. Repeat.
	The commute was bad. No doubt. But he was willing to suffer it for now. Maybe once he had some recent experience on his resume he might look for something closer to his apartment. But, he liked the people here and the work was challenging so far. He had deep dived into the existing build scripts and now understood them far better than Chen or anyone else on the DevOps team. Now that he had a good grasp on the current system he was hard at work devising a strategy to get the builds onto a server in the cloud and off his development machine.
	Today was an important day. After work there was going to be an all-hands status meeting in the large conference room on the first floor. Each development team was to give a brief presentation on their recent accomplishments. Everyone would be there. CEO, CTO, CFO, all the C-Level folks. Representatives from HR, Sales, and Marketing. And of course, all of development. About seventy-five to a hundred people, give or take. It was also important because it would be his first presentation at the company. Chen asked him to give one, since his work automating the build process was the most exciting thing the DevOps group had done this quarter. And it directly impacted the other development teams. So they would appreciate the update. He had never done a real presentation before and had spent the evening prior putting together PowerPoint slides, with lots of fancy graphs and animations. When he showed Chen and the others the final presentation they gave him high fives and said it was going to be a grand slam. He hoped so.
	The conference room was jammed with people. There was no more room at the large table or any seats left around the edge of the room. Everyone who arrived later had to stand. Chen, anticipating the crowd, had gotten Crystal and Steve to go down early and save seats for them all. So DevOps got prime seats at the table.
	When it came time for him to give the presentation he rose and introduced himself as a new member of the DevOps team. Not many knew who he was, having started so recently, but he saw a lot of friendly and encouraging faces in the crowd, and that gave him a boost of confidence.
	"So, I wanted to show you guys some of the progress I've made since joining the DevOps team last week. If you look at this chart, you can see our QA build and deployment processes have been averaging an hour up to almost two hours, ever since Project Fusion got off the ground back in late 2009."
	He paused for dramatic effect.
	"That sucks."
	The room erupted in laughter. He waited patiently for the attention to return to him, then resumed just as he had rehearsed in the mirror over the last two days.
	"What I've been working on, with Chen's expert guidance, over the past week, is taking the excellent scripts Abigail Bennett created and modifying them for deployment to our cloud TFS Build servers."
	At the mention of Abigail he saw Chen give him a frown and noticed some of good vibes in the room turned sour. A lot of stern or otherwise downcast faces. It was like nobody wanted to acknowledge she ever existed.
	"Skipping a lot of technical mumbo-jumbo, the upshot is we've decreased QA build and deployment times by 60%. The average build time is now 37 minutes. And we think we are able to get that down even more, with some clever artifact caching techniques."
	The room erupted again, this time in applause. Chen stood up and clapped. After the room quieted down again he went through a few more slides, showing how this improvement would speed up the entire development, QA pipeline. And then he thanked the crowd and sat down next to Chen, who clasped him on the shoulder like a brother.
	
  The presentations took nearly two hours in total. Afterwards the CEO gave some motivational words to the group and closed his speech by saying there was a catered buffet and open bar waiting in the meeting room next door. Everyone rose as a group and clapped. Then as a group they filed from this meeting room to the next one over.
  At the buffet table he dished a plate of roast beef, asparagus, and mashed potatoes and then grabbed a Dos Equis from the bar. He sat down at table with the rest of the DevOps group and they congratulated him on both the presentation and the progress he had made in such a short period of time.
  Fifteen minutes later the CEO came up to the table and also congratulated the team on their progress. Then he turned to Will and extended his hand.
  "Ponce Gregory. So glad to finally meet you. We're super impressed with the work you've done so far, Will, and are so excited to have you on board."
  "Thank you, Ponce," he said, "I'm glad to be here."
  Ponce scanned the table, nodding to Chen, Steve, Crystal, and Byron in quick succession.
  "Last year was difficult for this team," Ponce said, "But through the team's hard work, w got through it, and here we are. Looking up and lots of positive things on the horizon!"
  
   After dinner and most everyone else had left, he stuck around, had a couple more drinks from the bar, and went up to his cubicle to work through a problem that had been bugging him all day. He was too wound up from the presentation to leave. Plus he liked an office like this at night. The lights are turned low...
