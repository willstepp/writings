Ten

  The Jeep pulled into a parking spot at the McDonald's on Ponce de Leon. As soon as he switched off the ignition, almost as if it had been planned, the golden arches illuminated and the lights around the restaurant came on simultaneously. It was early evening. About six.
  He had parked at the back, where he had a clear view of the fence behind the drive-thru area. He scanned its length and found the opening about midway. From the glove compartment he pulled a tiny flashlight, nearly keychain-sized, and also a folding utility knife, serrated.
  Then few minutes passed in which he sat and thought everything through. It felt like something he needed to do. This was batshit crazy. What he needed in this moment was a pros and cons list of the facts. To help him figure out if what he was doing was the right thing, or maybe more importantly the safe thing.
  There were pros. Well, one pro. He wanted to understand what had happened to the woman who used to have his job. Abigail. A woman he learned he had things in common with. Oddly so. And one who he had come to genuinely like, after hearing about her from coworkers, seeing (private) photographs, and most of all reading her (private, stolen) diary. What was wrong with liking her? He felt for the tragedy of her life. A part of him wanted to reach out, even across time and space, to comfort her. Also, he was convinced foul play may have been involved in her suicide, if it was suicide. That's what he wanted to know. Needed to know. He felt that it would be honoring her memory to do discover the truth.
  The cons outweighed the pros. One: Abigail was not of sound mind. Therefore her diary is not a reliable source for objective facts about what happened. Example, she wrote about twice visiting an old man inside an empty room behind a Kroger, an old man who hugged her and listened to her problems. Two: Even if everything were true, she is dead and cannot come back. So what does this clandestine sleuth-work achieve, at the end of the day? Three: If you are right and there was foul play involved, then those involved won't appreciate you bringing into the light what they hid in darkness.
  He stepped out of the Jeep, zipped up his coat, pocketed flashlight and knife, and looked around to make sure nobody was watching. There wasn't.
  Next he walked towards the fence. The opening grew larger the nearer he got, and darker. It was like staring into a black hole, though above the fence line he could see the tops of the trees and bushes. Because he had psyched himself up in the Jeep, there was almost no hesitation when he reached the opening, and went through.
 The woods were dark. There was still faint light, through the gaps in the leaves, but not much. He pulled the flashlight from his pocket and turned it on.
 An intense white beam of light revealed the path in front of him. He followed it. After some time he came to a wide clearing, and stumbled over the old railroad tracks. He turned back the way he came and was a little surprised that he could no longer see the golden arches through the gloam.
 He walked for a long time, to the point where he was starting to question whether he was going in the right direction, when he saw light coming through the trees, just ahead.
 He had arrived, and was now looking at the back of the Kroger on Ponce de Leon. The same place he had been not very long ago, in the daylight. Everything was there, just as it had been. The delivery truck was gone. That was different. And the concrete steps, leading to a door. That was different too.
 It was a moment he had been dreading, a moment of reckoning, that would lead him down one path or another, definitively. And, being honest, this was not the path he had expected.
 Even more strange, on the steps was the black albino man, Rabbit (Marcus?). Just sitting there, wearing what he assumed to be the same shabby and ill-fitting suit Abigail had described in her diary entry. He was smoking a cigarette, looking at the ground.
 Fifteen minutes passed, until Rabbit ground the cigarette butt against the pavement and stood up. He removed some kind of chain necklace from around his neck. There was a pendant on the necklace. He approached the door, gripped the pendant like a key, and slid it into a slot in the doorknob. Then he bowed his head and looked as if he were in prayer. A moment later he opened the door and disappeared inside, closing the door behind him, and leaving the pendant key in the doorknob slot.
 It was a chance he might never get again. And he took it. Across the alley, up to steps to the door. He inhaled. Exhaled. Then, turned the knob. It was locked. He tried again. The same.
 "Damnit."
 Seeing the pendant in the doorknob slot, and the chain necklace hanging down, he grabbed it by the point where the pendant connected to the chain and pulled. It slid out.
 He rubbed his fingers over the pendant. It was flat and smooth, like a riverbed stone, oblong like an egg, and made of a material he could not place. It was vaguely metallic, hard but more organic. Chitinous maybe. Etched onto one side was a strange symbol, of geometric patterns interwoven.
 Then, he felt a violent thudding against his right temple and his vision went dark. He felt another against his shoulder and opened his eyes. Rabbit stood over him, holding a 2x4, growling at him.
 "Gimme dat key back!"
 He held up his arms in defense. Then scrambled to his feet, falling from the ledge in the process, and hitting the ground with both feet. He took off in a wild, chaotic sprint. He heard Rabbit shouting, running behind, and shot a quick glance behind him. He saw him, brandishing the 2x4 in both hands, his face twisted in rage.
 The edge of the woods was near. He jumped into an opening and ran until he could no longer hear footsteps behind him.
