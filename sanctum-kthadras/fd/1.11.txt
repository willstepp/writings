  You’re losing it. You’re losing your grip. This is not really happening. This is not reality. Reality is A squared plus B squared equals C squared. Reality is for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction. Reality is the total energy of an isolated system is constant and can be transformed from one form to another but can be neither created nor destroyed. Reality is this apartment. Reality is the city and the people who live in it. Reality is your car. Reality is your commute. Reality is your job.
  It was seven in the morning. He was awake, sitting at the edge of the bed, his feet on the cold floor. There was sunshine coming in through a window in the bedroom, shining onto the wall opposite him. Two hours ago he woke from bad dreams. Since then he had been pacing through the apartment, processing the events of the night before. He had returned to bed but just lay there, contemplating, until the alarm went off.
  He went into the living room and turned on his work laptop, sending an email to Chen and the rest of the Build team that he was taking a sick day, yet available by email if absolutely needed. Next, he made a pot of coffee and drank a cup while looking outside at the morning traffic, both pedestrian and vehicular. Looking but not seeing. After some time he turned towards the kitchen table where the pendant necklace lay. 
  It was still there. It was real. He had not imagined it. Nor had he imagined the scenario whereby he had acquired it.
  "You're losing your grip," he said, addressing the empty apartment. And he believed that. Whatever had happened to Abigail was now happening to him. Maybe they had used drugs or some mind-altering substance to make him hallucinate. And Abigail before him. That would make sense. Maybe the 2x4 he was struck with was laced with a drug that can be absorbed through the skin. He was reaching and knew it and was not convinced by his logic in the slightest. His stomach turned. It was the nausea of dread. The dread of having to confront this new reality. He did not want it. All he ever wanted was a normal life. The thing was, he couldn't stop now. He had learned too much that was unusual about the last days of Abigail. He felt an obligation to learn the truth and if necessary, inform the police. If there had been foul play he was the only one who had the details to put the pieces of it together.
  Now awake, he walked over and picked up the pendant and ran it between his fingers, feeling the smooth, cold surface, and the groove of the pattern on the front size. Then he set it down again and went to the large window and pulled the blinds all the way up, to maximize the amount of natural light coming into the room. From his pocket he pulled out the cell phone, freshly-charged, and took the best photo of the pendant that he could, making sure to shoot top-down and get the pattern as large in the frame as he could.
  Once he had a picture he was satisfied with he went to the laptop and copied it to the computer. He opened the browser and clicked on the button called Images. From there he was able to drag and drop the picture onto the window. When the photo had been loaded he was able to click on another button, which read "Perform Reverse Search".
  Almost instantly he was taken to a page of search results, displaying a grid of photographic matches to the picture he had uploaded. There weren't many and the majority of them weren't really matches at all. But there was one, not a photograph, but a crude drawing, that matched the pattern on the pendant almost exactly, though nowhere as intricate or artfully done. He clicked the image and it brought him to an internet archive page from ten years ago, a forum thread with the title "[serious] Unexplained mysteries from your own life". He scrolled through the thread until he found the image match. It was from a reply from a user named "throwaway88". He read:
  
"I've never told this story to anyone before. To be honest I'm not sure I should tell it now, though it's been five years. My guilt over what happened is great. Perhaps this will be my penance."

"My brother and I used to go on a road trip together every summer, just the two of us. It was a great bonding experience. The thing was, we weren't the type of guys to go to the beach or the mountains. Our interests were more esoteric you might say, or sometimes even morbid."

"The year of this story, we decided to visit the Winchester Mystery House in San Jose, California. It was quite far from where we lived and was going to be a week-long trip. But my brother had read about the house in a magazine with pictures and had become obsessed. It's a house built over fifty years, with rooms, windows, doors, and stairs, that lead in circles or sometimes nowhere at all. It was built by a crazy old woman, who thought if she ever stopped building the house, it would cause the spirits of the house to become angry."
  
"He convinced me and we left on a Tuesday and arrived on Saturday, tired but very excited to take a tour. We had breakfast and got there around lunchtime and made it just in time for the 1pm guided tour. It was a pretty large group. Well, you can probably figure what we did, about halfway through the tour. My brother saw an open door leading off of a hallway and indicated to me that he wanted us to go that way. I was hesitant at first, but seeing the look of mischief in his eyes, I decided what the hell."
