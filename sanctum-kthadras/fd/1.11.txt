  You’re losing it. You’re losing your grip. This is not really happening. This is not reality. Reality is A squared plus B squared equals C squared. Reality is for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction. Reality is the total energy of an isolated system is constant and can be transformed from one form to another but can be neither created nor destroyed. Reality is this apartment. Reality is the city and the people who live in it. Reality is your car. Reality is your commute. Reality is your job.
  
  It was seven in the morning. He was awake, sitting at the edge of the bed, his feet on the cold floor. There was sunshine coming in through a window in the bedroom, shining onto the wall opposite him. Two hours ago he woke from bad dreams. Since then he had been pacing through the apartment, processing the events of the night before. He had returned to bed but just lay there, contemplating, until the alarm went off.
  He went into the living room and turned on his work laptop, sending an email to Chen and the rest of the Build team that he was taking a sick day, yet available by email if absolutely needed. Next, he made a pot of coffee and drank a cup while looking outside at the morning traffic, both pedestrian and vehicular. Looking but not seeing. After some time he turned towards the kitchen table where the pendant necklace lay. 
  It was still there. It was real. He had not imagined it. Nor had he imagined the scenario whereby he had acquired it.
  "You're losing your grip," he said, addressing the empty apartment. And he believed that. Whatever had happened to Abigail was now happening to him. Maybe they had used drugs or some mind-altering substance to make him hallucinate. And Abigail before him. That would make sense. Maybe the 2x4 he was struck with was laced with a drug that can be absorbed through the skin. He was reaching and knew it and was not convinced by his logic in the slightest. His stomach turned. It was the nausea of dread. The dread of having to confront this new reality. He did not want it. All he ever wanted was a normal life. The thing was, he couldn't stop now. He had learned too much that was unusual about the last days of Abigail. He felt an obligation to learn the truth and if necessary, inform the police. If there had been foul play he was the only one who had the details to put the pieces of it together.
  Now awake, he walked over and picked up the pendant and ran it between his fingers, feeling the smooth, cold surface, and the groove of the pattern on the front size. Then he set it down again and went to the large window and pulled the blinds all the way up, to maximize the amount of natural light coming into the room. From his pocket he pulled out the cell phone, freshly-charged, and took the best photo of the pendant that he could, making sure to shoot top-down and get the pattern as large in the frame as he could.
  Once he had a picture he was satisfied with he went to the laptop and copied it to the computer. He opened the browser and clicked on the button called Images. From there he was able to drag and drop the picture onto the window. When the photo had been loaded he was able to click on another button, which read "Perform Reverse Search".
  Almost instantly he was taken to a page of search results, displaying a grid of photographic matches to the picture he had uploaded. There weren't many and the majority of them weren't really matches at all. But there was one, not a photograph, but a crude drawing, that matched the pattern on the pendant almost exactly, though nowhere as intricate or artfully done. He clicked the image and it brought him to an internet archive page from ten years ago, a forum thread with the title "[serious] Unexplained mysteries from your own life". He scrolled through the thread until he found the image match. It was from a reply from a user named "throwaway8888".
  
"I've never told this story to anyone before. To be honest I'm not sure I should tell it now, though it's been five years. My guilt over what happened still haunts me to this day. Perhaps this will be my penance. Perhaps telling it will relieve my guilty conscience. I hope so."

"My brother and I used to take a road trip together every summer, just the two of us. It was a great bonding experience for us. The thing was, we weren't exactly the type to go to visit the beach or look at the mountains. Our interests were more esoteric you might say, sometimes even morbid."

"That summer we decided to visit the Winchester House in San Jose, California. It was a house built over forty years by Sarah Winchester, widow of William Winchester and heiress to the Winchester firearms fortune. The house is filled with over a hundred rooms, with windows everywhere, in the floors and ceilings, with doors and stairways which circle back on themselves or open into brick walls. Legends say Sarah Winchester believed that if she ever stopped construction, it would anger the restless spirits of the house, who were the victims of the guns the company produced."

"The house was quite far from where we lived, and was going to be a week-long trip. But my brother had read about the house in a magazine with all kinds of descriptions and photographs, and had become obsessed with it."
  
"We left on a Tuesday and arrived in San Jose early Saturday morning, exhausted but very excited. We had breakfast at a diner and got to the Winchester house around lunchtime, just in time for the guided tour at 1 p.m. Ours was a large group of maybe sixteen people. So it was easy to hang in back and take our time going through the rooms. In one room, my brother saw an open door leading to a hallway and indicated to me that he wanted us to break off from the tour and explore on our own. I was hesitant at first, but seeing the look of joyous mischief in his eyes, I decided what the hell. You only live once."

"The house was a maze. After going through one door into hallway, which led to another door, and then another, we got completely turned around, and lost. I wanted to turn back, but my brother insisted that we should keep going forward, his idea being that eventually we'd reach the edge of the house. I reluctantly agreed. Next, we entered a long hallway with a window at the end. The window opened into a darkened room without any other entrance that we could see. My brother dared me to climb through the window, so I did. A few moments later he climbed through too. In the blackness we thought we saw the faint outline of light coming through the bottom of another door, up a few steps. My brother pulled out his Zippo and flicked it open. The small flame danced in the darkness, provided us with some light." 

"We approached the door. Carved into it, using very crude and shaky lines, was a bizarre, geometrical pattern, impossible to describe in words. I have since drawn it from memory. This is what it looked like, approximately."

And there it was. The same pattern from the pendant, or an amateurish attempt at it, though not nearly as complicated or symmetrical as the real thing. Through his mind went many thoughts. Then he downloaded the picture, and kept reading.

"I wanted to turn back and begged my brother to come back with me. He refused, saying I was a coward and there was nothing to worry about. Well, I never could deal with being called a coward. It's a deficiency of my personality, I guess. I told him okay, but he had to go through first. He agreed."

"He turned the old doorknob and pushed the door open, and we couldn't believe what we saw. It was a vast desert, with reddish-brown sand and an overcast, pea-green sky. Instead of closing the door immediately, my brother stepped through the doorway onto the sand and waved for me to follow him. I should have said no. I should have waved my hand for him to come back. But I didn't."

"We took in the surreal landscape. It was like no place I've ever seen, not in paintings or in the movies. It was fascinating and exhilarating. Several times we looked at each other and grinned. This was by far the best road trip we'd ever taken. It was only after a few minutes that we turned back to the door and saw that it was no longer there. The house wasn't there either. All we could see were dunes and endless stretches of plains, in every direction."

"My brother and I both panicked. It was cold out here and we had nothing to eat or drink. In the distance, very small, we saw what looked from here to be another door, and decided to check it out."

"An hour later we reached the door, and it was a door, without anything else around it. My brother reached for the knob and turned it, but it was locked. There was another kind of pattern on this door. One so intricate I won't even attempt to draw here. The door and the pattern filled me with dread. I asked my brother if we could go. I think he was thinking the same as me, because he said yes."

"Scanning the horizon we found other doors, and spent the remainder of that first day walking to them. Each door was more strange than the last, made from materials we didn't immediately recognize, some metallic, some earthen, some liquid, and some a material we have no reference for at all. On each one was a different pattern, more complicated than the last. And they all were locked."

"On the side of an enormous dune we found a small ingress, narrow enough for a human being to crawl inside. The entrance was surrounded by hewn stones. Since we were getting colder by the minute, we decided it may be a good idea to see if this was some kind of shelter from the elements. Turns out it was a small domelike structure, built with the same stones that lined the entrance. The ground was hard but we were so tired by that point it didn't matter. We slept."

"In the morning, or maybe evening, who knows, I had to pee and crawled outside. The light and the sky looked exactly the same as it had when we entered. I peed into the sand and then covered it up by sweeping my foot back and forth. Then, at the top of the nearest dune, not the largest, but a smaller one about fifty yards away, I saw a pale man wearing a dark robe."

"I waved my arms and then cupped my hands around my mouth and yelled. He faced me, but then turned and disappeared over the other side of the dune. I wanted to get my brother, but I was also afraid to lose the chance to learn something about this place. So I ran up the dune as fast as I could. By the time I got to the top I was utterly winded. I put my hands on my knees and caught my breath like a dog. From this height I could see for a mile in all directions. There were doors everywhere. Of all shapes and sizes. And made from all sorts of materials."

"Then I saw him. The pale man in the robe. He was walking, not very quickly, towards a nondescript door maybe a quarter of a mile away."

"I nearly tumbled down the other side of the dune, following him. Along the way I shouted, trying to get his attention. And after ten minutes or so, when he had just about reached the door he was walking towards, he turned to me."

"He introduced himself, in a polite way, and told me he was a Doorkeeper. I told him the story of what had happened to my brother and me, but he already knew. He smiled and gestured to the door behind us. 

"Is this the door you came through?" He asked.

"And it was. I was so happy. He then told me then I was free to walk back through the door, and it would take me back to the Winchester House, just as if I had never gone through it. But only one person can go back through. After that, the door vanishes forever. So I had a choice. Or choices. To leave my brother here and return home. To remain here and allow my brother to return home. Or to remain here with my brother."

"Now you know my story. Now you know the choice I made, and the guilt I now carry, and will carry with me, forever."
