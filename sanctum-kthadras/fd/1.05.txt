Mentioned to Dr. Patel that I once kept a diary in high school. He liked that idea. He said it could be therapeutic, writing my thoughts and feelings down on paper. So this is me starting a diary. Woohoo. Still not sure about it and I don't really feel like delving into the abyss right this second, but I wanted to write something at least so I can tell him I'm doing it.

Today I was pulling out of the Hobby Lobby parking lot, waiting at the red light, and suddenly right in front of me a Honda turning against traffic was t-boned by a pickup truck with a rebel flag in the back window. I mean right in front of me. The windshield of the Honda shattered, the airbag deployed, the woman inside tossed like a rag doll. It happened in slow motion. The shattered glass falling onto the road. The man in the pickup holding his bleeding head. In the aftermath I felt a responsibility. Like these strangers well-being were in my hands. But I was in line at a traffic light. Cars were behind me. The light turned green and I turned wide to avoid the wreckage, drove around the wreckage, and came back home. Did I do something wrong? I can't stop thinking about it. One part of me says no but another part of me says the other part is wrong. I was taught by you that you ought to help people, and I believe that, truly I do. But today I failed to help those people and I know the guilt I am feeling is my conscience. I can rationalize it away all I want and assure myself it was more logical for me to get out of the way, that it might have caused more issues if I had stopped to help. What bullshit. I should have done something. Called 911. Something. But I didn't do a thing. I know I'll remember this day fifty years from now, when I'm old and senile. Maybe on my death bed I'll remember this day and still feel this pang of regret for not acting. If you were still alive I would tell you about it and you would tell me not to worry and then hug me to sleep.

The Lexapro is starting to work. Dr. Patel said it might take up to two weeks to get the full benefit, and so far it's only been a week. Anyway, I'm finding it easier to sleep at night so that's good.
  
At our appointment I mentioned I started this diary. He was glad. He asked what I had written about so far and I told him about the accident at the Hobby Lobby. How it made me feel a lot of guilt. He reassured me and told me that what I felt was very common and nothing to worry about at all. It even has a name, the Bystander Effect. He said perhaps I could have pulled over to call the police or to check on them, but that what I did was also a perfectly acceptable reaction. Weirdly, just him saying that made me feel so much better. It lifted a weight I had been carrying around all week long. Words truly have the power to heal. It's easy to forget that. But it makes me appreciate this diary and the potential it has to help me.

Dr. Patel asked me to jot down some good memories about my mother. He said "it doesn't have to be all bad feelings, you know" and laughed a bit. I told him I would do that. Just not today. Tomorrow.

It is now 3:32 a.m. I woke up feeling like my brain was being electrocuted. Like a zapping sensation. I hope it's normal and that everything's all right. I will call Dr. Patel's office in the morning. I tried going back to sleep but I just tossed and turned. Thinking about you. It went downhill from there. Like a car without brakes. My mind returned to the accident at the Hobby Lobby. I replayed the the event over and over again. The guilt I had felt before returned. I tried to calm myself down and reminded myself about the Bystander Effect and how it was perfectly normal, but there was a voice inside me saying that was a lie and that every man and every woman on this Earth was responsible for every other man and every other woman and that furthermore what we call goodness is in reality not goodness at all but selfishness at the core and that selfishness and not goodness is the lifeforce of the universe and what I did at the Hobby Lobby was only proof of that cosmic reality. No matter what I did I couldn't silence the voice. And I did try. I prayed for it to stop. But the words wrapped themselves around my mind like a boa constrictor. I was unable to escape the strength of those words and by them I was suffocating.

What is the matter? What is wrong with me? Why can't I get over this? I know it takes time and that you never truly get over it. But I need some peace. I truly need a little peace right now. It's been over a month. You know what I realized the other day? I used to be the one people came to with their troubles. I used to be a source of strength and support, and now look at me. Every day I feel like I'm on the verge of collapse. Going to the Post Office sends me over the edge. Shopping for groceries overwhelms me to the point of tears. How will I ever return to work? Or go out with friends? Or get married? Have kids of my own? I feel like a broken human being. I truly do.

Dr. Patel says the brain zaps are normal and should subside in time. Headaches are also normal. So is lethargy and lack of appetite. Look at me everybody, all normal over here.

Nobody prepares you for it and I think know why. Because to talk about it is to face it and that can't happen. We live as if the life we're living at this moment will never end and that the people who populate our lives will never die. It's not true, but it's the only way we can get out of bed everyday and open the curtains to let the sun shine into the room. But you were my sun. The point around which my life revolved, without me even realizing it. And now that you are gone I am driftless, isolated, alone. In absolute darkness.

Today I was rummaging through the closet, going through some old boxes, and found the doll you got for Christmas of 1985. I had wanted a Cabbage Patch Kid, a preemie with blonde hair. But is was a knock-off. I'm not even sure it has a name. Cheaply-made. But it does have blonde hair. Anyway, I remember  how excited you were when I was opening the box underneath the  tree, down on the carpet with me, positively bursting with anticipation. And then seeing your eyes drop every so slightly when I hated it because it wasn't a real Cabbage Patch Kid. I remember you trying to console me, explaining how the dolls had all been sold out and people were selling them on the sidewalks for a hundred dollars or more and you just couldn't afford that right now. But I was nine. I didn't want excuses. I wanted the damn doll! I kicked and screamed and threw the doll into the trash can, like an ungrateful brat. I remember that very clearly. But you must have kept it all those years, hidden away, because it's sitting right here next to me. And it always will. What I wouldn't give to go back in time and do it all over again. I would be so grateful for the doll and give you a hug and tell you how much I love you. The truth is I'd rather have this cheap knock-off doll from you than a thousand real Cabbage Patch dolls. I will cherish it forever.

I think about the doll and I think about all those times I took you for granted. I keep going back to one particular evening we spent at home, after an early dinner at the Golden Corral. You were on the couch playing Candy Crush on the iPad. I was in my room on Facebook or YouTube. And I take myself back there and I ask myself, why didnâ€™t I go to you? I could have asked about your day. We could have talked about the really important things in life. The things people never talk about for some reason. Like, were you happy? What was the biggest regret of your life? What were your hopes for the future? I don't know the answer to any of those questions and I would give anything to have another chance to ask you them. But it can never be. Never.

I suppose it comes down to this, you were a precious being, a unique source of light in the world. A beautiful soul. But somewhere along the way I forgot your true nature. I forgot what you really were. I took you for granted and I'm sorry.
