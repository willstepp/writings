Mentioned to Dr. Patel that I once kept a diary in high school. He liked that idea. He said it could be therapeutic, writing my thoughts and feelings down on paper. So this is me starting a diary. Woohoo. Still not sure about it and I don't really feel like delving into the abyss right this second, but I wanted to write something at least so I can tell him I'm doing it.

Today I was pulling out of the Hobby Lobby parking lot, waiting at the red light, and suddenly right in front of me a Honda turning against traffic was t-boned by a pickup truck with a rebel flag in the back window. I mean right in front of me. The windshield of the Honda shattered, the airbag deployed, the woman inside tossed like a rag doll. It felt like it all happened in slow motion. In the aftermath I immediately felt responsible. Like their lives were in my hands. But I was in line. There were cars behind me. The light turned green and I turned wide to avoid the wreckage and came back here. Did I do something wrong? I can't stop thinking about it. A part of me says no but another part of me says yes. I was taught by my mama that you should help people in life, and I believe that, truly I do. But today I failed and I believe the guilt I am feeling is my conscience. I can rationalize it all I want and tell myself it was better for me to get out of the way, that I would have just caused more problems if I had stopped to help. That's bullshit. I should have done something. And I didn't. I know I'll remember this day fifty years from now, when I'm old and senile. Maybe on my death bed I'll remember this day and still feel this pang of regret for not doing something. If you were still alive I would tell you all about it and you would tell me not to worry and then hug me to sleep. But you aren't.

The Lexapro is starting to work. Dr. Patel said it might take up to two weeks to get the full benefit, and so far it's only been a week. Anyway, I'm finding it easier to sleep at night so that's good.
  
At our appointment I mentioned I started this diary. He was glad. He asked what I had written about so far and I told him about the accident at the Hobby Lobby. How it made me feel a lot of guilt. He reassured me and told me that what I felt was very common and nothing to worry about at all. It even has a name, the Bystander Effect. He said perhaps I could have pulled over to call the police or to check on them, but that what I did was also a perfectly acceptable reaction. Weirdly, just him saying that made me feel so much better. It lifted a weight I had been carrying around all week long. Words truly have the power to heal. It's easy to forget that. But it makes me appreciate this diary and the potential it has to help me.

Dr. Patel asked me to jot down some good memories about my mother. He said "it doesn't have to be all bad feelings, you know" and laughed a bit. I told him I would do that. Just not today. Tomorrow.

It is now 3:32 a.m. I woke up feeling like my brain was being electrocuted. Like a zapping sensation. I hope it's normal and that everything's all right. I will call Dr. Patel's office in the morning. I tried going back to sleep but I just tossed and turned. Thinking about you. It went downhill from there. Like a car without brakes. My mind returned to the accident at the Hobby Lobby. I replayed the the event over and over again. The guilt I had felt before returned. I tried to calm myself down and reminded myself about the Bystander Effect and how it was perfectly normal, but there was a voice inside me saying that was a lie and that every man and every woman on this Earth was responsible for every other man and every other woman and that furthermore what we call goodness is in reality not goodness at all but selfishness at bottom and that selfishness and not goodness is the lifeforce of the universe and what I did at the Hobby Lobby was proof of that cosmic reality. No matter what I did I couldn't silence the voice. And I did try. I prayed for it to stop. But the words wrapped themselves around my mind like a boa constrictor and I was unable to escape the strength of those words and by them I was suffocating.

What is the matter? What is wrong with me? Why can't I get over this? I know it takes time and that you never truly get over it. But I need some peace. I truly need peace. It's been over a month. You know what I realized? I used to be the one people came to with their troubles and now every day I feel like I'm on the verge of collapse. Going to the Post Office sends me over the edge. Shopping for groceries overwhelms me to the point of tears. How will I return to work? Or go out with friends? Or get married? Have kids of my own? I feel broken. I truly do.

Nobody prepares you for it and I think know why. Because to talk about it is to face it and that can't happen. We live as if the life we're living at this moment will never end and that the people who populate our lives will never die. It's not true, but it's the only way we can get out of bed everyday and open the curtains to let the sun shine into the room. But you were my sun. You were the orb around which my planet revolved. Now I am driftless. Alone in the cosmos. A planet without a sun.

Today I was rummaging through the closet, going through some old boxes, and found the doll you got for Christmas of 1985. I had wanted a Cabbage Patch Kid, a preemie with blonde hair. But is was a knock-off. I'm not even sure it has a name. Cheaply-made. But it does have blonde hair. Anyway, I remember crying like a baby when I opened the box under the tree, after seeing that it wasn't a real Cabbage Patch Kid. You tried to explain how the dolls were all sold out and people were selling them for a hundred dollars or more and you just couldn't afford it. But I was nine. I just wanted that damn doll. I kicked and screamed and threw the doll into the trash can. I remember doing that. But you must have kept it all those years because it's sitting right next to me. And it always will. What I would give to go back in time and do it over again. I would be happy for the doll and give you a hug and tell you how much I love you. Because the truth is I'd rather have a cheap knock-off doll from you than a thousand real Cabbage Patch dolls. I will cherish it forever.

I think about the doll and I think about all those other times I took you for granted.
