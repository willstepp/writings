  The book on the kitchen table was smaller than he thought it would be, but very thick, well over a thousand pages. The pages  were loose and held between two boards which appeared to be made from the same chitinous substance as the pendant, smooth and dark. The boards and pages were bound using twine which ran crosswise and lengthwise, and knotted in the center. There were worn grooves at the edges of the boards, top and bottom, left and right, which years of binding had eroded. Etched into the the boards, front and back, were geometrical patterns he did not recognize, surrounded by the symbol he did recognize. The only writing on the boards was near the bottom of the front, carved precisely in tiny letters:
  
K'thadras Piy Gwam

  With a pair of scissors from the kitchen he clipped the twine (because the knot could not be undone) and lifted the front cover board. The first page was an ordinary sheet of notebook paper, with food stains on the edges, and sloppy handwriting that read like weird axiomatic philosophy.
  
"All existence is consumption and all that has ever existed is consumption and all that ever will exist is consumption and ceaseless devouring, even to the end of time."

Then further down, a devotional prayer.

"Still we submit our offering in the hope one day He will know our presence and see that we are His true adherents. To Him we are like amoeba floating in stagnant waters. Less than amoeba. We are less than that. And yet we serve in perfect humility and we offer in faith eternal. K’thadras Piy Gwam."

  The phrase again. He didn't know what to make of it, but maybe it was important. He flipped through the pages and noted the pages were in reverse chronological order. The further he went the older the pages. A rich, nutty smell emanated from the yellowed pages near the end. These felt brittle, like dry leaves.
  From what he could tell the book was not organized by anything except time. Some pages were handwritten. Some typed. Some on thick paper. Some thin. White. Yellow. Blue. The content seemed equally chaotic. If one page was a confession the next would be a devotional. And if one page was a devotional the one after that would be a list of ingredients or an alternate history. The really bizarre ones were illustrations of fractals or of unsettling plant and animal life. Like nothing he had ever seen before.
  He scanned the pages, looking for anything that might help me understand the room behind the Kroger on Ponce de Leon. What he wanted was a guidebook, but this read more like scripture.
  
"One whose eyes gaze from this dimension into the next, into yet another, a billion times over, one from another and back again, even to the very beginning of time - where the true home of such a one?"

"In my dream I sought to know the nature of K'thadras and received this reply. Destroyer of the destroyed. Consumer of the consumed. Devourer of the devoured. Eater of the eaten.  Annihilator of the annihilated. Ravager of the ravaged. But also. Creator of the created. Artist of the artifact. Lover of the loved. Giver of the given. Revealer of the revealed."

  He became frustrated. In the kitchen he made a sandwich and opened a beer. When he returned he decided to try another approach. He would skim anything that struck him as pure devotion or revelation and look for ritualistic or historical fact. What he needed was concrete details how the organization functioned in the real world. Nothing so far was helping him achieve his goal to use the pendant to get into the room. But he was sure it must be there, somewhere.
  After flipping through page after page of various scripture, something caught his eye and he stopped. At the top of the page was a Nazi symbol. This was a historical document of some kind.
  
  Hitler retreated to his Führerbunker in Berlin on 16 January 1945. It was clear to the Nazi leadership that the battle for Berlin would be the final battle of the war in Europe. Some 325,000 soldiers of Germany's Army Group B were surrounded and captured on 18 April, leaving the path open for American forces to reach Berlin. By 11 April the Americans crossed the Elbe, 100 kilometres (62 mi) to the west of the city. On 16 April, Soviet forces to the east crossed the Oder and commenced the battle for the Seelow Heights, the last major defensive line protecting Berlin on that side. By 19 April, the Germans were in full retreat from Seelow Heights, leaving no front line. Berlin was bombarded by Soviet artillery for the first time on 20 April, which was also Hitler's birthday. By the evening of 21 April, Red Army tanks reached the outskirts of the city.

  At the afternoon situation conference on 22 April, Hitler suffered a total nervous collapse when he was informed that the orders he had issued the previous day for SS-General Felix Steiner's Army Detachment Steiner to counterattack had not been obeyed. Hitler launched a tirade against the treachery and incompetence of his commanders which culminated in a declaration—for the first time—that the war was lost. Hitler announced that he would stay in Berlin until the end and then shoot himself. Later that day, he asked SS physician Dr. Werner Haase about the most reliable method of suicide. Haase suggested the "pistol-and-poison method" of combining a dose of cyanide with a gunshot to the head.

  By 27 April, Berlin was cut off from the rest of Germany. Secure radio communications with defending units had been lost; the command staff in the bunker had to depend on telephone lines for passing instructions and orders, and on public radio for news and information.

  Shortly after midnight on 29 April, he married Eva Braun in a small civil ceremony in a map room within the Führerbunker. Hitler then hosted a modest wedding breakfast with his new wife, after which he took secretary Traudl Junge to another room and dictated his last will and testament. It left instructions to be carried out immediately following his death, with Grand Admiral Karl Dönitz and Joseph Goebbels assuming Hitler's roles as head of state and chancellor respectively. He signed these documents at 04:00 and then went to bed. Some sources say that he dictated the last will and testament immediately before the wedding, but all agree on the timing of the signing.

  Hitler and Braun lived together as husband and wife in the bunker for less than 40 hours. By 01:00 on 30 April, General Wilhelm Keitel had reported that all of the forces on which Hitler had been depending to rescue Berlin had either been encircled or forced onto the defensive. At around 02:30, Hitler appeared in the corridor where about 20 people, mostly women, were assembled to give their farewells. He walked the line and shook hands with each of them before retiring to his quarters. Late in the morning, with the Soviets less than 500 metres (1,600 ft) from the bunker, Hitler had a meeting with General Helmuth Weidling, the commander of the Berlin Defence Area. He told Hitler that the garrison would probably run out of ammunition that night, and that the fighting in Berlin would inevitably come to an end within the next 24 hours. Weidling asked Hitler for permission for a break-out; this was a request he had unsuccessfully made before. Hitler did not answer, and Weidling went back to his headquarters in the Bendlerblock. At about 13:00 he received Hitler's permission to try a break-out that night. Hitler, two secretaries, and his personal cook then had lunch, after which Hitler and Braun said farewell to members of the Führerbunker staff and fellow occupants, including Bormann, Goebbels and his family, the secretaries, and several military officers. At around 14:30 Adolf and Eva Hitler went into Hitler's personal study.

  Eva was distraught. She would not listen to reason. From the the bookshelf she pulled the old tome and opened it on the coffee table in the center of the room. He begged her to stop this insanity and accept reality, gripping her by the arm. But she was adamant and broke free. She flipped through the pages until she found the ritual. She met his gaze, hatred burning in her eyes.
  "You never believed," she said, "You were never a believer. You only pretended. I know. You believe in nothing."
  He knelt beside her.
  "If this is what you want, I will do it."
  She stopped, her breathing hard.
  "This is the way out, my love. Away from all of this."
  "You are sure?"
  She nodded. He thought about it momentarily, and then agreed.
  "What must we do?"
