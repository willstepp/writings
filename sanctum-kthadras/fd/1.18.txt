  The book on the kitchen table was smaller than he thought it would be, but very thick, well over a thousand pages. The pages  were loose and held between two boards which appeared to be made from the same chitinous substance as the pendant, smooth and dark. The boards and pages were bound using twine which ran crosswise and lengthwise, and knotted in the center. There were worn grooves at the edges of the boards, top and bottom, left and right, which years of binding had eroded. Etched into the the boards, front and back, were geometrical patterns he did not recognize, surrounded by the symbol he did recognize. The only writing on the boards was near the bottom of the front, carved precisely in tiny letters:
  
K'thadras Piy Gwam

  With a pair of scissors from the kitchen he clipped the twine (because the knot could not be undone) and lifted the front cover board. The first page was an ordinary sheet of notebook paper, with food stains on the edges, and sloppy handwriting that read weird devotional.
  
"All existence is consumption and all that has ever existed and all that ever will exist is consumption and ceaseless 
devouring. This is what we see. This is what we know. Still we submit our offering in the hope one day He will know our presence and see that we are His true adherents. We understand that we are like amoeba floating in stagnant waters to Him. Less than amoeba. We are less than them. And yet we serve in perfect humility and we offer in faith eternal, Kâ€™thadras Piy Gwam."

  The phrase again. He didn't know what to make of it, but maybe it was important. He flipped through the pages and noted the pages were in reverse chronological order. The further he went the older the pages. A rich, nutty smell emanated from the yellowed pages near the end. These felt brittle, like dry leaves.
  From what he could tell the book was not organized by anything except time. Some pages were handwritten. Some typed. Some on thick paper. Some thin. White. Yellow. Blue. The content seemed equally chaotic. If one page was a confession the next would be a devotional. And if one page was a devotional the one after that would be a list of ingredients or a secret history. The really bizarre ones were illustrations of unsettling patterns like fractals or of weird plant and animal life. Like nothing he had ever seen on Earth.
