July 2

Found this diary underneath a laundry basket of clothes that don't even fit me anymore. I guess you could say it's been a minute. But here I am. Still kicking. Last time I wrote was the day I moved in here with Stephen. That was over a month ago. Feels like longer. It's a small one-room with a kitchenette and a bathroom with a toilet that doesn't flush half the time. Only one bed, but there's a cot I sleep on. We tried sleeping in the same bed for a few nights, but I toss and turn and Stephen couldn't sleep. This place is a real shithole. Just a bunch of Mexicans and lowlifes is all it is. I'm ready to move somewhere better, but unfortunately don't have any money right now. Even worse I've been stuck inside for the last two days. Recuperating from a broken collarbone and a few bruised ribs, or they could be broken too. I don't really know. All I know is Ibuprofen doesn't help the pain one bit. Weed helps, but that's in short supply. Stephen doesn't want me to show my face right now. He doesn't even want me walking to the Dollar General down the road. “Might look suspicious,” he says. But he doesn’t know. Just makes it up as he goes along. I know that. He doesn’t own me. And he doesn’t know everything either. Like, he doesn’t know I went out to earlier this evening, while he was gone to Kennesaw to score from Rodriguez. And I won’t tell him where I went either. He doesn’t need to know everything. That is mine and mine alone.

It's so boring here. All there is to do is sit and look out the window. A couple moved in across the parking lot. This Mexican guy and his pregnant girlfriend. Or it could be his wife. I don't know. She's annoying as hell. The first thing she did was set out all these plants and succulents in front of their room. The next day I saw she had new orange curtains and matching chairs out front. Last she hung a little arrangement of flowers on the door, and a wooden sign with cursive writing that says, "Home is not a place. It's a feeling". She sits outside most of the day and talks on the phone, laughing like nobody can see her stupid ass. And when her man gets back from work in the evening she greets him at the door with a kiss and they sit outside and eat dinner together. Every. Single. Day. I don't know. There's just something about her I can't stand. Like she thinks she's too good to be here or something.

Okay. If I'm gonna write in this diary then I guess I better write about everything that's happened since my last entry.

It really went downhill once my car broke down. That was a few weeks ago. The garage told me the engine had seized up because of an oil leak I didn't even know about. $1250 to replace the engine from a junkyard. That was the cheapest anybody would do the job. Neither me or Stephen could afford that. Not even close. My savings had run out. We had already pawned my television and stereo from the old apartment and used that to pay for rent and other things. Stephen was broke too. But he didn't really care about the car. His license had been revoked a few years ago, after so many DUIs, so he was used to bumming rides from his friends or riding the bus. All he cared about was getting money for our next score. None of his connections would help him out anymore, since he had robbed them all, one by one.

I did what I could. I put up an ad on Craigslist and hooked up with men in their cars. Or took a cab to their place. Or wherever. That helped us to pay the rent each week, and to score on a regular basis, but wasn't enough to fix my car. Even that was getting harder to do for me, if I'm honest. Whenever a man saw the gross scar on my face, or how thin I was compared to the photos in the ad, they always looked disappointed and angry, "You don't look nothing like your photos," they said. Most of them just walked away, cussing me out, calling me a drug addict and a whore.

But I'm not. I know I'm not. Deep down. Those are things I do. Not what I am. The things I have to do to survive don't define me as a human being. Even though I know I shouldn't let it bother me, especially from some pervert asshole, it hurts to be judged like that. It's like they're saying to you, "This is all you are and all you ever were and all you will ever be, until the day you die." The thing is, I'm not ashamed of what I have to do to numb the feeling inside of me. I'm used to it by now. It's always there, gnawing away at me, eating me, from the inside out. To be honest, it doesn't even bother me anymore, because I know how to deal. I lose myself. In sex. In drugs. Whatever it takes. I lose myself completely. I don't care anymore. I'm free of care. I'm free as a bird. Truly I am.

That went on for a couple weeks. I was able to earn a little but it ran dry pretty soon. Without any money to score we got more and more desperate. Finally, Stephen got mad and said we should just sell the car to make a few hundred dollars. Even if it was broken we could sell it for that. With that we'd be able to pay the week's rent and then get high as a fucking kite, in his words. But I really didn't want to give up my car. It was about the only thing I had left of my own and I really didn't want to give it up. I said let me try one more thing. He asked me what, and I said "Don't worry about it."

I sent my sister a text. We hadn't spoken since I moved out, but she responded right away. I asked if she would meet me and she wrote back, "Anytime, anywhere." So I asked her to meet me the next day at the Chevron station a few blocks from the Crown Inn. That way I could just walk down there. She agreed.

The next day I went down there and saw her car already in the parking lot. She watched me cross the parking lot. When I got close she got out of the car and I could see that she had been crying. She dried her eyes and we hugged. Then we went inside  to a little kitchen in the back that served homemade arepas, run by a family of Colombians. We ordered and sat down to talk.

Melanie apologized for being so hateful about the power bill. She said she had her own things going on and lashed out at me. But she did apologize. I told her it was okay. There was some awkward silence as she looked me up and down.

"Abigail, you don't look well. I barely recognized you in the parking lot just now. You can't weigh more than eighty pounds. Are you sick? Do you have enough to eat?"

She noticed the bruises on my forearm and gripped my arm, roughly, rolling up the sleeves. She saw the marks and looked at me, helplessly, tears welling in her eyes.

"Be honest with me. I mean really tell me the truth. Have you been shooting drugs? Is that what these marks are from?"

I told her I didn't come here to be judged. Then I told her all about the car and how it would really help me out right now if she could loan me $1250 temporarily, until I get back on my feet. I even offered to pay her back with interest. When I finished she was quiet and wouldn't say anything. She looked down at the arepa on the table, then towards the restrooms, then out the window at the cars in the parking lot. She looked everywhere except at me, which made me feel very isolated and disrespected.

"Say something, Melanie!" I shouted. 

Several people in the store looked over at us. But my sister did look at me after that. She took my hand.

"Calm down. It's going to be okay. Just calm down."

She took another moment and looked at me very seriously. I could tell whatever was going to come out of her mouth next would not be good. And it wasn't.

"Abbie, I want you to come back with me. Right now. Wherever you're staying right now. I don't care. I don't want to know about it. Let's go back to the apartment. Right now. I had the power turned back on after you texted me. You can stay there for as long as you need to. I will help you get your car fixed, whatever you need I am here for you."

It was then I sensed a "But" coming, and it did.

"But here's the thing. You need to admit you have a problem. You need to agree to enter a rehabilitation program. And stop associating with the people you're in with now. Your enablers. I spoke about it with Dave and he is willing to help pay for the rehab, even though it's expensive. I'm very worried about you, sister. I don't want to see you go down this road. I'm afraid of what's going to happen. We love you and we are here for you. All of us. Just the other day Grant asked me where Aunt Abbie was and I didn't know what to tell him. I just cried."

We sat there, neither one of us saying anything. A few times I was about to say something but then stopped. I'll be honest. A lot of what she said sounded good to me. I'm not too proud to admit that. Things were not going very well for me, in that moment. But here's the thing. If I accepted that, moved back into the apartment under those conditions, she would control every aspect of my life. I would be living under her thumb. I wouldn't even be able to take a shit without her signing off on it first. And I don't want that. To the core of my being I don't want that. I wanted to say all that to her face, so that she'd know why I was refusing her offer, but I knew she wouldn't hear anything I had to say. She'd already written me off as somebody who needed to be taken care of, not an equal who deserved respect. So I figured what's the point. I got up and left.

She followed me of course. She begged me to reconsider. She apologized again for making me upset. She said that wasn't her intention. I kept walking, down the sidewalk, back to the Crown Inn. That was the last time I saw or spoke to Melanie. I blocked her number after that.

That night Stephen convinced me to sell the car. We put up an ad and by the next day someone had already come by to load it onto a trailer. We got $2500 for it, which would allow us to pay rent and get high for a couple months. That was a good feeling.

Stephen went out and scored a ball and we shot up that same night. By three in the morning, both of us were bouncing off the walls. Coming up with all kinds of plans. It was then Stephen had an idea which would allow us to make a lot of money and keep us high for a long time.

His plan was simple. We'd take some of the money we now had and rent out another room, under a false name, put up an ad on Craigslist using some of my old photos and a burner phone. Then when the johns came, I'd meet them at the door, get them undressed and vulnerable. At that point Stephen would burst in and we'd rob them of their wallets, phones, watches, and whatever else they had on them. These guys would be so ashamed   they wouldn't go to the cops. They'd go back to their car and drive away. Plus, once we had their wallet we could use their ID to blackmail them into silence if we had to. If we were really smart we'd also rotate rooms at a few different places. 

At first light I went to the front office. There was an old Indian man at the counter, behind plexiglass, drinking coffee. I asked him for a room for a week. He told me how much and asked for my identification, but I told him I didn't any actual identification right now, but that I was happy to give him the information. At first he refused. He pointed to a cardboard sign on the counter where it was written in marker, "Must have ID to rent room. No exceptions." But I offered him an extra fifty for the week and he agreed. I gave him a bullshit name and address and that was that.

When I got back Stephen had already put up an ad on Craigslist, using some of my more sexy photos and a provocative message about what services I would provide. He was always better at writing that stuff than me. He told me to go to the room and hide some weapons around the room. A can of mace, a couple knives, and a small pistol for my own safety. He told me to keep that in a place where I could get to it in case something went wrong.

I went to the room and turned on the air conditioner. It was hot. The room was like ours, with a single bathroom, small kitchenette, and a queen-sized bed against the wall. There was also a low dresser with a television on top. The room smelled vaguely of old cigarettes and piss. I hid the weapons around the room, imagining how various scenarios could play out.

Then I went back to our room and we both waited, shooting up to maintain our high. By now we were both on the comedown and I was beginning to feel the twitches in my arms and neck. It wasn't long before we got a text on the burner phone.

Saw yr ad. Are you available tonight?

Stephen responded.

Yes I am baby. 150 for hour

They went back and forth and finally told the guy to come to the Crown Inn and text when he got there.
