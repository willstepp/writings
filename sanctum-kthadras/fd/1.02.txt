  He was about five miles from the office, in bumper to bumper traffic, in the bottleneck of the southbound tollbooth lanes, when the rain that had threatened all day finally came down. It was a downpour. A deluge. The last thing he needed after a stressful first day and during this hellish commute. He was still unfamiliar with the best lanes to be in and found himself constantly in lanes that became exit only, or else ended. Or that he needed to be five lanes over in half a mile to make a connection. And the rain did not help. He shouted, honked, banged on the steering wheel, and forced his way into whichever lane he needed to be in. He saw other commuters doing the same. There was a leak from the door of his Jeep that dripped freezing rainwater onto his knee and just about sent him over the edge. At one point he gripped the wheel with all his strength and screamed wildly until his vision grew dim at the periphery and stars appeared from nowhere.
  Inside the perimeter the traffic at last relented but the storm did not. Flashes of lightning illuminated the hazy skyline of the city. Tall buildings obscured by the rainfall appeared suddenly out of the mist, like giants in a fairy tale, towering high above him. He drove under a tube walkway connecting two buildings and spanning the entire width of the interstate. Inside the tube he saw the silhouette of a man with his head in his hands. Then he drove into a tunnel diffuse with an amber glow. Surrounded by dozens of cars going the same direction. They had been there all along but in the light he became aware of their proximity. The sudden change disoriented him in a way he felt almost primal. He panicked and felt a tightness in his chest. There was something chaotic in all of this, unnatural, and the only way to deal with it at all was to tune it out and keep your foot on the gas pedal, until you made it through.
  	Yet all through the ordeal of the commute there was a part of him that kept stealing glances at the black laptop bag in his passenger floorboard. The same part of him kept repeating her name over and over again: Abigail. And the questions: Who was she? What did she look like? Where did she live? And most of all, Why?
  	At last he pulled off the exit and turned onto Monroe Avenue. Immediately the knot inside his chest loosened. The rain still came down in torrents, but he was close to home, in familiar territory, and so relaxed. His plan to walk down to George's for dinner was dashed, obviously. After his commute all he wanted to do was get back to the warmth of his apartment and crash out. But he was still hungry. Briefly he considered ordering delivery, Mellow Mushroom maybe, but his conscience would not allow him to ask a delivery driver to go out in this mess only for him. He could be an asshole sometimes, but he wasn't that kind of asshole.
  	Along the way there was a CVS Pharmacy on the corner and he pulled in and parked. He ran inside, jacket pulled over his head, and grabbed a shopping basket. Wasting no time he went to the food aisle and picked up some dry spaghetti, marinara sauce, and some canned mushrooms. He also grabbed a bottle of their finest Cabernet Sauvignon. At the counter he realized he forgot the parmesan cheese and ran to the aisle and back again as quickly as possible, ignoring the faces of the customers behind him in line.
  	There was a security gate at the entrance of his building. He entered the code they had provided to him, his apartment number plus 404. Not the most rigorous security system in the world, but whatever worked. He had been assigned a parking spot which was fairly close to his stairwell. He shouldered the laptop back and carried the groceries up to the third floor. Along the way he passed a couple of young women carrying laundry baskets. He gave them both what he thought to be a charming smile and they returned his smile, genuinely he hoped. This building had been recently renovated. It was very hip, with exposed concrete floors and support beams. The walls were painted in bright shades of burgundy, mustard, and hunter green, depending on the floor. The walls of his floor were burgundy while his door was painted black.
  	Inside he put the groceries on the island and dropped the laptop bag on his desk for later. The first thing he did was look for a corkscrew to open the bottle of wine, but unfortunately all of his non-critical kitchenware was still in boxes piled next to the pantry. Not having the energy to look through the boxes he did the next best thing and used a paring knife to carve up the cork. This was a poor choice and after ten minutes of poking, pushing, and chopping at the cork, he was finally able to get enough leverage to pull it out. He poured a glass into a tumbler. These were the only glasses he currently owned, one of the many things he meant to address after his big move to the city.
  	The first glass he downed at once. He needed it after that commute. Two hours it took him, from the office parking lot to his apartment building. He hoped the non-downpour commute would be a bit less hectic, and shorter. He poured another glass and set it on the counter. Then he looked for a couple pots and a colander, which thankfully he had already unboxed. He boiled the pasta and heated up the marinara and mushrooms and combined the final product into a red, plastic mixing bowl. On top he poured nearly half the can of parmesan cheese and mixed it all together with a fork. He took his third glass of wine to the couch and sat there and wolfed down the entire bowl. It was gone in five minutes.
  	As he ate he looked around the apartment, at all the boxes left to be unpacked, and sighed. It would have to wait until the weekend. This commute was going to be a killer. He knew that going in, but then maybe he didn't fully appreciate how it would be on the day. Maybe once he got familiar enough with the platform and technology stack, Chen would allow him to work from home a couple days a week. It didn't seem unreasonable to him.
  	He flipped on the TV and found some re-runs of Jersey Shore. This was good to zone out for a bit, let his gourmet meal settle. This was comfort food for the mind. In his younger days he scoffed at people who wanted to turn off their brain and relax with reality shows. But now he got it. You only have so much bandwidth and have to conserve energy for what is truly important in life. He watched the exploits of these assholes for awhile, his attention wavering, drifting in and out of focus. Then he was asleep. He did not realize he had fallen asleep until he woke up and another show was on, a show he did not recognize. He turned off the TV.
  	His eyes went to the laptop on the desk in the corner. He mustered some energy and sat down, pulling the laptop from the bag and plugging it into the outlet on the wall behind the desk. That done he turned it on. The screen lit up and a few minutes later he was logged on and staring at the desktop. He opened the file where he had been taking notes earlier in the day and reviewed them. Then he opened the last script he had been reading through and re-familiarized himself with it.
  	But the wine had dulled his brain and he was very tired. So he drifted off from time to time, while reading through the code. Before he knew it he was browsing the filesystem. There did seem to be something he was looking for, though perhaps he was not yet conscious of it. Under the Home folder was another folder called Pictures. He opened that and saw an entire directory of folders, named things like BahamaCruiseNov2007, BlueRidgeAppleFarm, and GrantBDayPartyAug2009.
  	He clicked on the folder called BahamaCruiseNov2007. It was a photo album containing dozens of pictures, of a cruise obviously, to the Bahamas presumably. The first picture he clicked on was a self portrait of a young woman and what looked to be her mother, based on their shared features. They both wore sunglasses and wide-brimmed hats. They were clinking together two glasses of pÄ«na coladas and laughing. This had to be Abigail. The young woman in the photo. It had to be her and he knew it. Without knowing it he knew it.
  	She had pale, slightly freckled skin, with dark brown hair cut into a bob, exposing her neck and slightly-sunburnt shoulders. Her smile was happy. In most of the photos she was wearing a dark one-piece bathing suit underneath a white sun dress. He began to feel like a creep, admiring a woman who was no longer alive. These photos were intimate, meaning they were for family and maybe friends on social media. Not for public consumption, and certainly not for him.
	Most were taken near pools and lounge chairs, and in most they held tropical drinks. The only people in any of the pics were the young woman and the person he supposed to be her mother. Towards the bottom were some photos taken on an island, at least it looked that way. There were some long shots of the young woman looking through souvenirs and finally a picture that confirmed it once and for all. In this photo the young woman was holding up a wooden mug with the words 'Abigail's Cocoa. Hands off!' carved into it. He could also see her eyes for the first time in this one, as he sunglasses were raised on her head. Her eyes were warm and open.
	He spent the next hour looking through them all, scanning for clues into her personality. He still had so many questions. But he was fascinated. And he supposed it truly was a morbid fascination. For the life of him he was unable to reconcile the woman he saw in these photos, so full of joy and life and laughter, with death, with suicide.
	Around ten he looked up and saw the time. Half the bottle of wine was gone and his vision was a blur. He had spent the last few hours immersed in the photo life of Abigail. But Abigail who? He hadn't even learned her full name yet. He opened the email client they had set up for him and looked for any previous accounts or logins. Soon he found what he was looking for. There was history of an account under 'abennett', so her name was Abigail Bennett. He attempted to open the email account itself, but it was password protected, and he had neither the focus nor the mental energy needed to try to crack the code tonight.
	Every ten minutes he gave himself permission to look for ten more minutes, but that was all. And at the end of every ten minutes, he gave himself permission again. Unsuccessful with email he looked through the Documents folder and found several things of interest. The first thing were a couple of templates for Medical Power of Attorney and Financial Power of Attorney. The second was a PDF explaining the various stages of breast cancer. The last was a text file called 'expense.log' detailing specific expenses for hospital stays, doctor visits, and prescriptions.
	Did she have cancer? His first instinct was no. Perhaps her mother did. That seemed more plausible given their ages.
