The eaters of the fetus try to recreate it, mechanical, dead, mundane
work.

He triumps over them by yielding to their violence.

The story diverges at a single point, either resenting the fetus and trying to recreate the fetus by machine, or embracing the loss, descending and becoming a fetus

The creatures appear transclucent though this is because his eyes can see through their flesh, like x-rays, rather 
than because their skin had that characteristic.

A parable about a man who finds himself lost in a forest where the trees 
are barren and the ground is covered in leaves. The man is unable to remember his 
name or where he's from. He can't event remember long he has been walking. He 
discovers a strange fetus floating in a milky pond. In the surrounding forest 
there are creatures who want to harm the fetus and he protects it from them.

An enormous sun that overtakes the sky and burns away the leaves.

A blue nebula, with tentacles spread across the black firmament. Something so far from him, light years away. Something alluring. If wings sprouted from his back one day he would fly to it.

The creatures black, hardened. Later learn they were burned by the sun.

After he nutures the fetus and it departs, he can either stumble in sadness and clean 
himself in the milky waters, sinking in and discovering a world below the surface, where 
he loses his body and floats the surface as a fetus himself, nourished by the waters and a 
tendril from some depths.

Or, he can grow bitter and angry and resent the fetus for leaving him, burned further, and 
join in with others who attack other fetuses, and those who want to protect them.

If you join the creatures you learn they hide (in some weird way) during the sunrise, this 
implies that at one time they too protected fetuses, being exposed, and somehow turned.

In the milk he joins with another being, a scene of making love, becomes the fetus.

You call the things you see all around you trees, and rocks, and grass, and leaves, but not 
because they are really those things, but because that is how your mind is able to make sense of them. 
Your memory of those things creates the association, since they have the nearest relationship through 
both form and behavior. But then sometimes the thing you call a tree will bend down consciously 
and sniff around and the illusion is broken. But you can't help yourself. It's how the mind works.

He could no longer take the BS. 

"My soul is starving for something good. Something true." As he spoke these words 
aloud in the car he recognized it was not something people said. Normal people don't speak like that.

I know you’re going through hell, but I don’t deserve to be talked to like that.

Fetus as a conclusion to the story, a kind of redemption to his suffering?

In the central garden of the park there was a room. No building, just a room. The realization of that caused him confusion. Yet there it was.

Blue whale, Momo - something to do with that, maybe instead of following the con-man, he receives an email from him, initiating the game, which leads to the Murder Kroger, behind which he discovers a park in which there is a cabin. The old man who lives there takes your grief. The final message says to kill the man who lives in the room.

images of the murder, eviceration, other things which reveal about his wife

His pain is the loss of a wife and child from a murder/suicide from text game (only hinted at)

The man who lives in the room is part plant part human.

Part one ends with a vision of the future, where the elder thing breaks apart the world in space.

How does the man figure into it? How does he act as the white rabbit? Maybe the man doesn't know why his wife murdered his newborn son and herself. The only thing connecting them is a symbol.

Receives an email with the subject line, 

'Thanks, brother!'

Inside is a link, clicking it opens an app whose icon is the same symbol. Installing it triggers the game.


Insight into Will: 'The wisest one of all formed no opinions.' He wants to remain an observer, curious but not a part of things.


# Email Notes

## The Man Who Lives in the Room

### General

* He stops caring, decides to tell only the truth. Creates a scene in a meeting. Is fired. While driving home a man asks for a ride. Then spins him a yarn, finally asks for money. The man stops at an ATM and gives him his daily maximum. He follows the man into a park. The man is living in a condemned building next to the park. He finds the man paying an elderly woman who lives alone. He learns that for a fee she will take on your sins, freeing your conscience. He goes to see her but finds she has hung herself. Somehow find the deep web. A woman in trouble. Wants to help her. Deeper into dark corners of the city. Start introducing Cthulu mythos.

* Maybe the old woman learned this skill from an old text, leading back to Cthulhu. In investigating her suicide, he eventually becomes the next vessel.

* Sanctum - better name?

* A man distraught his mother has died.

* he grows accustomed to her taking his pain, descends deeper into dark web, sex, violence - then, a scene of redemption? before he takes the place, impressionistic scenes of horror

* Sanctuary Park is known in the city as Murder Park. There is a condemned apartment complex behind it, where derelicts live.

* His pain is the loss of a child (and wife?)

* Blue whale, Momo - something to do with that, maybe instead of following the con-man, he receives an email from him, initiating the game, which leads to the Murder Kroger, behind which he discovers a park in which there is a cabin. The old woman who lives there takes your grief.

* Thank you brother - the email subject line

* In the central garden of the park there was a room, no building, just a room. If that sounds confusing that’s because it was. And disorienting. Yet there it was.

* That particular Wednesday began just the same as any other Wednesday he could remember. Awake a good twenty minutes before the alarm was to go off, at seven a.m., he cocooned into the blanket with his phone and swiped through social media to catch up on the news of the day.

* Wednesday began the same as any other. He opened his eyes a good twenty minutes before the alarm was set to go off, marked the time he had left, and then cocooned into the blanket with his phone and swiped through social media to see what was new in the world.

* My soul is starving for something true. Something good.

* I know you’re going through hell, but I don’t deserve to be talked to like that.

* Part one ends with a vision of the future, where the elder thing breaks apart the world in space.

* Nothing is left undone.

* What if the game makes him do increasingly horrible things and then go to the man who lives in the room. There the man feeds on his pain and suffers and afterwards he feels released. Others visit him and pay money. He then goes to the man to take away the sadness of the death of his wife and daughter, through a token. At that a door opens in the room. He enters it and is taken to a primitive world where people come to him to absolve their sins.

* The world rearranges itself. Nobody seems to notice except for him.

* Story of Greg neighbor, an endless despair. Story of cheek love about mother.

* As the book opens he starts a new job as a computer programmer and discovers the last person with his job committed suicide for mysterious reasons. He uncovers clues on his old laptop and investigates. ‘Beware the Man who Lives in the r0om’

* In the journals the suicide man describes how he found the man who lives in the room, how he slowly sucked his lifeforce to feed some eternal horror deep within the bowels of the Earth, becoming less and less like a man himself until the man who lives in the room became something else. At the same time the reader investigates and tries to find this man who lives in the room, discovers a portal where time and space bend, though not explained. He uncovers an ancient magic, goes into the deep web, murder Kroger, and as the story closes he learns the magic, the ability to take on the suffering of others. Suicide man walks into the room. The End.

* Bukowski does a great thing in his books. His chapters have an ability to resonate outside their boundaries. You feel you're getting only a slice of a larger story.

* Evoke the nominus. *numinous.

* He has a dream the night after reading the suicide note, about a distraught woman writing in her journal, putting it in a drawer and then getting up and putting a noose around her neck and hanging herself. This makes him curious, so he goes to the house, where he discovers the journal.

* Sanctum Kthadras

* Journal is a Composition Book. Therapist recommended she keep one after mother died.

* Because there is no information about The Order of Kthadras on the web he must use the dark web in order to learn the word of entry. Meets up with a man in a room of the old Clermont hotel, who robs him and nearly kills him until he sees the pendant, after which he kneels and prays and does whatever he asks. Tells him the words, or writes them down. The man runs away. The highest members of society, men of the most power and means, serve the One Who Waits.

* Trust in Him. Trust in the One Who Waits.

* He finds a todo list Abigail wrote to herself: - Fix SVG icons for Dave - Fill out timecard and expense form - Write journal entry. Stop putting it off!!! This leads him to wonder where the journal is. In dream he visits, sees hanging corpse with tentacle face, beak for mouth, hundreds of tiny eyes, it points to the desk, which catches on fire. He wakes, drives there in the middle of the night. The door is unlocked. He finds the journal. Something benign jumps out.

* After he finds the body in the Ford Escort he contemplates telling the police. He almost burns the journal but reads on. In the next entry she describes doing the same thing.

* Remember therefore from whence thou art fallen, and repent. - Revelations, 2:5

* Will: He goes for a walk and finds a bar, orders a burger and a large draft of beer. He asks to use the phone and leaves an anonymous tip with the police about the body. He decides that’s it and when he returns home he puts the journal away in a storage box in the closet, a decisive end to his curiosity. Very decisive indeed, a voice mocked him later in the middle of night, when he was tossing in his bed, unable to sleep, But you didn’t throw it away.

* Do not ask me for my opinion. I do not know — that is all. HP Lovecraft, The Color Out of Space

* I think the problem with Laird Barron is that his writing is too eloquent and ‘le mot just’ and therefore feels safe in a way that undercuts any horror the story contains. With his work I feel like I’m comfortably removed from anything too disturbing to my worldview. Compare this to Ligotti, whose work feels truly dangerous, like the ground has crumbled away beneath your feet, exposing you to the raw void.

* Only use description to describe the environment, people, atmosphere, not to project metaphors or other ideas you have. Keep it about the reality of story’s world. In other words don’t write like the previous reply (He rounds a hill and sees the skyline of the city spread before him, half a million lights coalesced into a glow...). This is important if you want readers to feel the uncanny when it comes.

* The story of a photojournalist who took a photo of a starving child who died and then soon thereafter killed himself.

* Maybe contacting the person on the dark web initiates some kind of trial, like the blue whale, which gets increasingly hallucinatory and culminates in the discovery of rabbit and the book in the clermont hotel.

* Maybe he has to take a pill as part of it. Maybe it asks him to commit suicide, which he will not do.

* They frame him for murder of rabbit using the knife he used for something else, when he was trying to rescue something.

* You have to communicate your progress to a 'curator'. Maybe the curator is the one he speaks with in the end.

* Before you get any deeper, be sure this is what you want.

* The trials have him hurt things, starting small.


### Abigail

* The horror of watching yourself become something you don’t recognize. Losing your humanity without being able to stop.

* And as the feeling of numbness went away there was left a hole. Deep and wide. Crying out like a child to be filled. I became more and more depraved. Oh God please forgive the things I’ve done. I dove into the deep web. Forgive me.

* Alicia Dodgson

* (re: argument with mother?) You are a good soul. A precious being. And I had forgotten that being caught up in what seemed so important at the time.

* Regrets every harsh word she spoke or thought about her mother.

* She describes a dream in which she is on a strange world millions of light years from the Earth. The landscape is strange and the rules of our world do not seem to apply. An enormous sun overtakes the sky and chars the surface, destroying all life.

* A memory of a cool, summer night when they lived in a trailer out in Adairsville, katydids chirping in the nearby thickets, on her stomach in the living room in front of the box fan on its highest setting, melting crayon tips against the spinning center of the blades, mother in the kitchen frying up chicken, dancing to music on the radio as she worked. She watched her mother through the spinning blades of the fan and breathed in the thick aroma of hot oil and flour. And I had a feeling I wasn’t able to understand then, but do now, of love and pure happiness and most of all a deep faith in the goodness of all things.

* She works with a pimp and they rob johns.

* She does things for cruelty’s sake. Puts glass shards in the dirt of a playground...etc

* She thinks good thoughts to block out the hurt

* She tried to think of a good memory, but there was none left within her.

* People bring out your true potential, or else it doesn't blossom. You might spend your entire life dormant.

* She lay there after in the dark and quiet of the hotel room. Her mind drifted to memories of a lost time, of the backyard at her maw maw and paw paws, of them smiling and helping her on a little pink tricycle, pedaling on the grass, her maw maw with the crippled fingers. And she wondered how it was that moment time no longer existed in this reality. And it made her heart sick and she wanted to die rather than live one more day in a world where such things happen. And tears fell from her eyes in the dark and quiet of that hotel room, and no one else in the room knew of her tears.

* Sometimes it was like we were complete strangers who knew everything about each other. She made me so frustrated I wanted to scream and still I knew I couldn’t live without her. No, not exactly that. I couldn’t live without her being there. It was like she was the Sun and I was the Earth. Everything I was only made sense in my relation to her. And now the sun had burned out and I was suddenly a planet adrift, abandoned, alone in a dark, vast universe that cared nothing about me.

* She writes an entry seething at her mother and then apologizing

* Where does the anger come from? I feel ashamed of the way I feel.

* She didn’t believe in goodness anymore. As a concept yes but not in it’s reality. She reflected on the things in her life that she had always believed to be examples of goodness and saw only selfishness, greed, and manipulation. A part of her still longed to believe in goodness but it could not be.

* Give illustrations of benevolent acts and then deconstruct them to a self-interested core.

* When she kills him, it is like all the rage and anger had left me and all that remained was pity for him, suffering and alone, in that room that was his prison.

* She buys things on credit, becoming obsessed with acquiring material possessions.

* She feels overcome by a delirium where at the same time she is aware she is doing wrong and does not care.

* She regrets the time she did not spent with her mother. She remembers a night when they were doing nothing, her in her room on Instagram, her mother in the living room playing games on her iPad. Why didn’t I go and speak to you? I could have asked about your day? I could have brought you a coke from the fridge. I would do anything to have another chance to do that just one more time. But it can never be. Not ever again.

* We could have talked. I could have told you about the memory I have when I was seven and we lived in that trailer up in Adairsville...and you were in the kitchen and me on the floor in front of that dirty old box fan, melting crayons on the spinning hub...

* She remembered a time when her beliefs and dreams had been pure and good. It made her heart ache that she had lost them now, forever.

* I felt understood (by the man who lives in the room)

* Abigail Echols

* She writes an entry that she cannot remember a memory she previously wrote down. She is afraid. What is wrong with me? I don’t want to forget who I am. It’s all I have left in the world.

* Her mind twists into believing it would be better had she never been born. Her journal ends with; Mama (dried tears stain the page)

* She wonders whether life will always get better. And decides that no. It has no obligation to do that. And we have to live with that knowledge. A dog does not. That is what makes us human, the awareness of our predicament. Besides the anti-natalism she grows to resent her mother and what she stands for.

* We cannot ignore the inferno.


### Will

* He IS the man who lives in the room, the cause of the previous worker’s suicide. The man who committed suicide is in despair after his mother passed away. He writes his confessions in git, overwriting the previous entries.

* Your role is to feed our Master. Do you accept this honor? I do. With all your heart? And with all your mind, forever until the return of Shoggoth Ur? Yes. People will bring you food for our Lord. And you will bring this food to him. Others have taken this role and are remembered to this day. Jesus of Nazareth...etc. I don’t understand. How will I know what to do? What people will come? From where?

* Before being told of role he explores outside and walks into an ancient world. He is brought a sick child but cannot help it and it dies.

* He grows old in the room. Waiting.

* He feels a connection, as if their fates are bound together in some way he can’t articulate.

* Becomes obsessed with learning about her, is drawn to her beauty, looks up her address. 

* After reading first entry, where she meets the man who lives in the room, he feels guilty, like he’s exploiting her troubled mind for his own amusement and puts the journal away, planning to return it eventually. Then one evening after work he finds himself driving aimlessly through the city and drives past the murder Kroger. Investigates bit does not find the door. This causes him to reopen the journal, where he learns of her troubles after.

* He doesn’t make eye contact with people. Is that normal? He wonders.

* Wants to bring them to justice

* It would be impossible to gauge how much time had passed inside the room, but by now his skin was quite wrinkled, his hair mostly fallen out, and his thoughts much of the time muddled and confused. He had spend his time in the room reflecting on the nature of Kthadras and of all the things he was blessed to have been shown by him. So it filled his heart with gratitude when at last he heard the doorknob turn and in walked a woman, pensive and alone. He then rose and faced her, smiling. “Where are you hurting, Abigail?”

* He reflected on the reality of Kthadras and how much of his life he had spent not even aware of His presence.

* As he stared at the inhuman form of Kthadras he saw himself as if from behind, his own consciousness in retreat until he was staring at the back of his own head.

* He felt compelled to help her, which he was aware seemed paradoxical, and yet he felt that way.

* He saw the form of the abomination and understood at last. He understood 'Kthadras' was not it’s name at all, but instead the name human beings had given to it three hundred thousand years ago. Clearly he understood this formless corporeality had no name and could not ever.

* Words to describe it came into his head. Words like tentacled. And yet there were no tentacles. Slimy but there was no slime. Only those who have witnessed it could ever understand what that meant. The closest thing to looking at it that we have would be a hallucination. A storm of strange matter, collapsing forever in on itself, a vortex of blood, skin, bone, muscle, and sinew.

* He wept at it’s reality.

* Make it very clear his desire to protect her, even after death. To right the wrong of her death. And to restore justice.

* He wanted very much to protect her, understanding how paradoxical that feeling was and yet feeling that way just the same.

* I woke in the night feeling like I was suffocating. Like I was confined in an uncomfortable space and wanted to move but couldn’t. I remembered a movie about Vietnam where prisoners of war were kept in a small wooden box with small air holes for days at a time. The thought of a torture like that wouldn’t leave my mind. I wanted to die. Better to die than that.

* He didn’t want to save her. That made no sense anyway. But it was something like that, in a way, he supposed. What he really wanted was to protect her memory and also to bring whoever it was to, justice? But that was bullshit and he couldn’t keep up that line of self-delusion for very long. No, the simple and only truth of it was, he wanted to _know_.

* I wait because it waits.

* He wakes in the middle of the night and feels an unbearable loneliness and a fear that is unplaceable but very real. He longs for Abigail and feels she would understand.

* His thoughts turn to feeling isolated from society and its values. His work is meaningless and he knows it. He has daydreams of walking away from it all, maybe walking cross country. When he discovers Abigail's journal he feels a sense of purpose again.

* He goes for a drive in the night after these thoughts?

* He rounds a hill and sees the skyline of the city spread before him, half a million lights coalesced into a glow that radiates into the black and starless skies above. He wonders how many of the people are asleep right now, visiting strange worlds filled with strange inhabitants that flames brightly for a few hours and then goes out forever.

* Millions of souls asleep and dreaming of strange, wonderful, and perhaps horrifying worlds that live only a few hours and then blink out of existence forever. In these dreams they process the mundane problems of waking life, reunite with loved ones dead or estranged, and fulfill the secret wishes of their hearts.

* Millions of souls asleep and dreaming of surreal, wonderful, and even terrifying worlds that live only a few hours of time and then blink out of existence forever. In these dreams we process the mundane problems of waking life and fulfill the deepest and most secret wishes of our hearts. Weird shit if you thought about it long enough. Fucking weird.



### Rabbit

* The pendant is in the con mans mouth

* His name is Rabbit. He’s a black albino.


### Work (Sanctuary Park)

* Someone follows him to his car after his first day at work and tells him about Alicia's suicide. He tells him he forwarded him an email she sent to the entire company they day before they found her. She hung herself apparently. Nobody knows why, except that she was depressed over her mother.

* Sometimes we would go for walks down by the pond behind the office. She didn’t have anything else to offer after that, looking to him with some kind of anticipation. He had nothing to give her.

* She was a beautiful soul.

* Of course it doesn’t work, why would it?

* For some reason it went through his mind what it would be like if he took off all his clothes right now and walked inside the building very business-like, buck ass naked, and then in the next moment censuring himself. Normal people don’t think about things like that, Will. Don’t be weird.

* The scene where the woman tells him about the suicide, the wind is rising and a storm is approaching.

* The sun comes out at lunchtime. They go to the cafeteria in the main building and sit outside. They tell stories about programming and he is wondering the entire time about Abigail. Maybe he keeps talking about her in hopes someone will talk about it.

* He can see her personal calendar, which she has linked into her work schedule. Dates with a psychiatrist...etc.

* Why is it everyplace you work there has to be at least one asshole? They joke at lunch. And if there isn’t one, it may be you! I’ve never worked with an asshole.

### Murder Kroger

* The place is below the Murder Kroger. The Man Who Lives in the Room. He takes away feelings of sorrow. The place links to the past and the future. Somehow the Dark Web is involved.

* The portal is in the back of the Bad Places, which here is the Murder Kroger. The portal is The Room.

* Con man is in the hatchback of an old Chevy Citation, blown wheels, covered with pollen. He sees a flickering light inside, smells a putrid odor, hears the buzzing of insects, opens the hatch and sees his dismembered body of the con man arranged in an asymmetrical pattern, surrounded by burning candles. The egg pendant inside his mouth.

* He runs in horror from the dismembered con man, into the woods, where he sees a meteor shower, an aurora, then comes across a dinosaur.

* Under the light of the nebula he stumbles upon the sleeping dinosaur, who opens its eye and looks at him.

* He emerged into the grocery store next to the fresh seafood counter. He bought some Cheez-Its on the way out and ate them on way back to McDonalds, taking the sidewalk up Ponce de Leon.

* Maybe something needs to replace rabbits death scene, maybe it comes too early - but then how does he get the pendant - perhaps he is attacked by rabbit, pulls the pendant from around his neck and escapes into the woods? That would allow building to the death of rabbit to attain the book, ratcheting the tension in a more linear way, while still indicating danger to him.



### State Hospital (Virginia)

### Will's Apartment

### Abigail's Apartment

* (Dream) Sees her try to light the journal on fire, put it out, then hide it instead.

* Has a dream he visits the house and discovers a journal when her hung body with tentacles for a face point at the dresser. He wakes up, unaware he was dreaming. It’s the middle of the night. The house is the same as his dream. He finds the journal.

* The place looks like his dream, except reverse. And darker. He uses phone as flashlight.

* Exploring the house he sees his reflection in the mirror and is startled.


### The Goat Farm (Art Center)

* You think you are safe. You are not safe. Thanks, I’ll watch my back. It’s not your back I would worry about. What should I worry about then? Your soul.

* You’re too cocky. He laughed. You think you’re safe...

* You still think you’re safe...

* Places like the Murder Kroger are areas where Kthadras has broken through the shell and manifested himself in the everyday world.

* Why are you looking at me that way? You’ve been giving me these looks this whole time. This bemused look, and I don’t like it. Do you not take me seriously? I admit I do find you a bit amusing. I apologize. My mother never taught me manners. But why are you amused? This is not a joke to me. It’s been keeping me awake. I have barely slept. I laugh to myself, and I do apologize for that, because you still think you’re merely an observer to all the horrible and tragic events you’ve uncovered here. You still think you can close the journal anytime you like and simply walk away. In a word, you still think you’re safe. You are not safe.

* This professor woman is giving a lecture, which he attends, at which she explains the origin of the Kthadras myth...with all brethren forming the planets of our solar system, sanctums in the nomenclature of the adherents. He speaks to her about the pendant and discloses the journal. She smiles at the end and he blows up. She grabs his hand and he sees a tattoo of the egg symbol on her wrist. You are not safe.

* Impartial observer. In the vernacular of the adherents

* I admit I do find your situation a tad amusing. This is not a joke to me...

* I’m not sure it was a suicide. Murder? I don’t know. I feel like this group took advantage of her somehow, drugged her, whatever. How else do you explain the things she’s described. How indeed.

* (She is not in the Order) The professor cannot help him get into the room, however, there is a book that describes the inner workings of the Order. It is not published and cannot be found on the World Wide Web, as far as I know. But I have a contact for such arcana, obscure primary texts, that sort of thing. I could give him your information and tell him what you are looking for? He’s a strange guy (at least I think he’s a guy) but reliable. Please do that. I have this feeling Alicia’s suicide is not what it appears to be. And I want to find out more before I do anything like going to the police. Out of curiosity, may I ask why? I don’t want them to dismiss me as some lunatic and fail to give it the proper attention. On paper this sounds completely insane. So I want to have all my ducks in a row. And what else? Why are you smiling at me that way? You’ve had this look the whole time we’ve been speaking. Do you know something? Tell me Goddamnit! Her smile faded and she took a moment to collect her thoughts. I apologize. I’m sorry. Okay? This amateur detective work of yours is amusing to me, and my mother didn’t teach me any manners. But let me ask you one question, have you ever stopped for one moment to reflect on your current situation? What do you mean? It’s all I can think about. It’s eating me up inside. Obviously. But what I mean is, you still believe you are nothing but an impartial observer...

* What I mean is, you reach out to me and tell me this bizarre story of a woman’s death, looking for clues like you’re Colombo or something, just ‘workin a case ma’am’, you see what I mean? But that’s not what’s really going on here. It’s as clear as day, you just haven’t recognized it yet. You still think you’re nothing more than a concerned citizen, an impartial observer to the tragedy you’ve uncovered. You still think you can close that journal anytime you like, maybe make an anonymous phone call to the police, and then go on with your life, just like it was before. But you are a part of this story now. A role has been written for you and you are playing it at this very moment, by coming to speak with me. Don’t you see that? To put it more bluntly, because I can see by your reaction that you’re not seeing it — you still think you’re safe. She reached out and grabbed his hand and squeezed it hard, as you would to wake someone who was inside of a deep dream. You are not safe.

* There is a handbook of some kind, a practical guide the Order uses to conduct it’s rituals. It may have the information you require. I’ve never seen it myself. My man on the inside claims he can get a copy for me, but it doesn’t come cheap. That’s what has prevented me so far, on my shit salary. But if you were willing to pay the asking price?

* I’ll be speaking at the Anthropology and the Occult conference in Chattanooga over the weekend, you’re welcome to come by. I’d love to hear more of your story and to be perfectly honest take a gander at that pendant!

* Important that the lecturer gives him a contact on the deep web, accessed via Tor, then the arrangement to meet in a public place, Clairmont?

* You have this pendant because they want you to have it. Why don’t you see that?


### The Room

* But it was not just that he was present in the room that filled me with that dread. Somehow I knew he lived here. That this was his home, this inhospitable room in the back of the Kroger. And the implications of that fact, the strangeness and plain incongruity of it, because this was no place to call home, that was what terrified me.

* The egg-shaped pendant fits into a slot in the door.

* I killed him in an act of rage and pity, the spike pierced his head like it was a bowl of jello. It went right through to his brain. He next squirmed and...

* The spike pushed into the skull like it was a soft, moldy piece of fruit.

* Tore into the skull like...

* Monkish robes, K’thadras

* There were no words to describe its nature. No human words. But there was a feeling, a deep sense of hopelessness and never-ending despair.

* Abigail: I can recall every detail of the room and yet if you were to ask me a simple question about it, like what is the color of the walls, I couldn’t tell you. How strange that sounds now that I’ve written it down.

* All the anger went out of me. I understood the man was as much of a victim of this as me when I saw the suffering in those still recognizable eyes.

* They don’t wear robes, instead they are dressed from cultures throughout history.

* Why should I seek out suffering? I don’t believe in that sort of thinking. You don’t need to do anything. Suffering will seek out you.

### The Man

* “He knew my name. He knew everything about me.”

* “What ails thee, Jerome?” The man who leads Jerome there is a member of the cult.

* People all throughout time come in through the door asking for help. He gives advice at first, then helping with aid. He has an experience in one time that indicates a healer, but only by suggestion. That is when Jerome walks in. This is the final chapter of the book. Healers throughout history have been his pawns, have served from the Room: Jesus, Mother Theresa...other examples through history. All to serve his will.

* ‘Where do you hurt, Jerome?’

* By killing him with a stake she sends his soul to the Other world. He is the nameless protagonist of The Fetus.

* The room is as you wish it to be, which I thought a strange way to put it. You see what you wish to see. I don’t wish anything. Of course you do.

* I don’t wish anything. But you do. All your life you do, because life is nothing but a wish. I don’t understand what you mean by that. You will. In time all will be revealed to you, as it was to me. And you will understand.

* "The room is as you wish it to be," which I thought was a strange way to put it. I told him I didn't wish anything. And I'll never forget what he said next. He seemed momentarily confused, taken aback really, his eyes squinting, his eyebrows furrowed. "But you do," he said at last, calmly and with utmost sincerity and conviction, "Your entire life is a wish."

* The world is his dream and we mere phantasms which haunt our corner of his dream for a brief time.

* Pain begets pain and hurt begets hurt and hatred begets hatred, all in the ceaseless maelstrom which is existence. There can be no end because there was no beginning. But what about love? Joy? Kindness? Forgiveness? These are delusions, hormonal discharges, biological sleights of hand, to help propagate the species. They are not real in the way that suffering is real. I don’t accept that. It is not a requirement of reality that you accept it. Insanity is a perfectly valid response.

* Your entire life is nothing but a wish.


### Weekly-Rate Motel

* She sees a woman out the window, pushing a stroller down the sidewalk and longs to be her, sees how far she is from that reality and it breaks her heart.


### The Book

* A crude sketch in the book of a man inside a box

* When he has the book, it is written in strange English, with words he does not understand. There is repeated reference to the ‘words of admittance’ but he cannot find them anywhere mentioned. As he is drifting off to sleep reading his vision blurs and he sees hidden text on the page, between the visible words. From this he learns the phrase which will open the door.



## The Fetus

### General

* Fetus as a conclusion to the story, a kind of redemption to his suffering?

* A voice within, yet not a voice. It comes over you like an urge or a compulsion. And it says, Eat not the fruit of this world. You think this will not make life here easy. He has joined with the band of scavengers who scour the plains and eat the ‘fruit’. Protect the fruit of this world. Join us. You are like us. We grow stronger the more we stay together.

* It was funny, well not funny at all, but fascinating. Before those words ‘you are one of us’ were uttered you don’t remember what you were, if you even had a corporeal existence at all. Yet as if the act of speaking those words made it so, you look down and find that you are in fact like them, though you lack the blackened carapace that seems to cover them all.

* A place where you can make things appear with your mind?

* Should feel like a discovery, each scene revealing something strange and mysterious about the world in which you are in.

* The Fetus - make it feel like Revelations, strange vision after strange vision, unfolding in front of our protagonists eyes. He is along for the journey until he decides to act and save the fetus.

* The Fetus - craft the narrative itself to pull the reader through. End first chapter as the protagonist crests an outcropping overlooking a valley, ‘you cannot believe your eyes.’ The protag eats the mud and debris, though there is no nutrition in it.

* The Fetus - protagonist is not aware he/she is not human, until the encounter with the carapaced hunters.

* The Fetus - Exploring the Ruins of a Once-Great Civilazation.

* You are filled with an inconsolable longing but for what exactly you do not know.

* You encounter a jellyfish-like enormity whose victims are visible within its belly, in various states of corruption. You see hopeless tentacled creatures lashing against the translucent membrane, in pain. You encounter a lightning storm that is conscious. It sends electricity out and moves with the wind. Everything in this place is about eating.

* Everything about you is consumption, unending.

* Everything here is consumption, unending.

* You hate what you see. And you are consumed by that hatred.

* The Fetus - he walks through a forest of old bones, gargantuan and fractal-shaped.

* The Fetus - you feel as if who you are or were faded is there but obscured, in a fog that will not blow through. There are times it comes into a clearing and you glimpse it better.

* The Fetus - a constant sense of unease, homesickness, nostalgia for a time and place you can’t remember.
