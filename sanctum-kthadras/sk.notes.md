# Email Notes

## The Man Who Lives in the Room

### General

* He could no longer take the BS. 

* "My soul is starving for something good. Something true." As he spoke these words aloud in the car he recognized it was not something people said. Normal people don't speak like that.

* I know you’re going through hell, but I don’t deserve to be talked to like that.

* Fetus as a conclusion to the story, a kind of redemption to his suffering?

* In the central garden of the park there was a room. No building, just a room. The realization of that caused him confusion. Yet there it was.

* Blue whale, Momo - something to do with that, maybe instead of following the con-man, he receives an email from him, initiating the game, which leads to the Murder Kroger, behind which he discovers a park in which there is a cabin. The old man who lives there takes your grief. The final message says to kill the man who lives in the room.

* Images of the murder, eviceration, other things which reveal about his wife

* His pain is the loss of a wife and child from a murder/suicide from text game (only hinted at)

* The man who lives in the room is part plant part human.

* Part one ends with a vision of the future, where the elder thing breaks apart the world in space.

* How does the man figure into it? How does he act as the white rabbit? Maybe the man doesn't know why his wife murdered his newborn son and herself. The only thing connecting them is a symbol.

* Receives an email with the subject line, 'Thanks, brother!'

* Inside is a link, clicking it opens an app whose icon is the same symbol. Installing it triggers the game.

* Insight into Will: 'The wisest one of all formed no opinions.' He wants to remain an observer, curious but not a part of things.

* He stops caring, decides to tell only the truth. Creates a scene in a meeting. Is fired. While driving home a man asks for a ride. Then spins him a yarn, finally asks for money. The man stops at an ATM and gives him his daily maximum. He follows the man into a park. The man is living in a condemned building next to the park. He finds the man paying an elderly woman who lives alone. He learns that for a fee she will take on your sins, freeing your conscience. He goes to see her but finds she has hung herself. Somehow find the deep web. A woman in trouble. Wants to help her. Deeper into dark corners of the city. Start introducing Cthulu mythos.

* Maybe the old woman learned this skill from an old text, leading back to Cthulhu. In investigating her suicide, he eventually becomes the next vessel.

* Sanctum - better name?

* A man distraught his mother has died.

* he grows accustomed to her taking his pain, descends deeper into dark web, sex, violence - then, a scene of redemption? before he takes the place, impressionistic scenes of horror

* Sanctuary Park is known in the city as Murder Park. There is a condemned apartment complex behind it, where derelicts live.

* His pain is the loss of a child (and wife?)

* Blue whale, Momo - something to do with that, maybe instead of following the con-man, he receives an email from him, initiating the game, which leads to the Murder Kroger, behind which he discovers a park in which there is a cabin. The old woman who lives there takes your grief.

* Thank you brother - the email subject line

* In the central garden of the park there was a room, no building, just a room. If that sounds confusing that’s because it was. And disorienting. Yet there it was.

* That particular Wednesday began just the same as any other Wednesday he could remember. Awake a good twenty minutes before the alarm was to go off, at seven a.m., he cocooned into the blanket with his phone and swiped through social media to catch up on the news of the day.

* Wednesday began the same as any other. He opened his eyes a good twenty minutes before the alarm was set to go off, marked the time he had left, and then cocooned into the blanket with his phone and swiped through social media to see what was new in the world.

* My soul is starving for something true. Something good.

* I know you’re going through hell, but I don’t deserve to be talked to like that.

* Part one ends with a vision of the future, where the elder thing breaks apart the world in space.

* Nothing is left undone.

* What if the game makes him do increasingly horrible things and then go to the man who lives in the room. There the man feeds on his pain and suffers and afterwards he feels released. Others visit him and pay money. He then goes to the man to take away the sadness of the death of his wife and daughter, through a token. At that a door opens in the room. He enters it and is taken to a primitive world where people come to him to absolve their sins.

* The world rearranges itself. Nobody seems to notice except for him.

* Story of Greg neighbor, an endless despair. Story of cheek love about mother.

* As the book opens he starts a new job as a computer programmer and discovers the last person with his job committed suicide for mysterious reasons. He uncovers clues on his old laptop and investigates. ‘Beware the Man who Lives in the r0om’

* In the journals the suicide man describes how he found the man who lives in the room, how he slowly sucked his lifeforce to feed some eternal horror deep within the bowels of the Earth, becoming less and less like a man himself until the man who lives in the room became something else. At the same time the reader investigates and tries to find this man who lives in the room, discovers a portal where time and space bend, though not explained. He uncovers an ancient magic, goes into the deep web, murder Kroger, and as the story closes he learns the magic, the ability to take on the suffering of others. Suicide man walks into the room. The End.

* He has a dream the night after reading the suicide note, about a distraught woman writing in her journal, putting it in a drawer and then getting up and putting a noose around her neck and hanging herself. This makes him curious, so he goes to the house, where he discovers the journal.

* Sanctum Kthadras

* Journal is a Composition Book. Therapist recommended she keep one after mother died.

* Because there is no information about The Order of Kthadras on the web he must use the dark web in order to learn the word of entry. Meets up with a man in a room of the old Clermont hotel, who robs him and nearly kills him until he sees the pendant, after which he kneels and prays and does whatever he asks. Tells him the words, or writes them down. The man runs away. The highest members of society, men of the most power and means, serve the One Who Waits.

* Trust in Him. Trust in the One Who Waits.

* He finds a todo list Abigail wrote to herself: - Fix SVG icons for Dave - Fill out timecard and expense form - Write journal entry. Stop putting it off!!! This leads him to wonder where the journal is. In dream he visits, sees hanging corpse with tentacle face, beak for mouth, hundreds of tiny eyes, it points to the desk, which catches on fire. He wakes, drives there in the middle of the night. The door is unlocked. He finds the journal. Something benign jumps out.

* After he finds the body in the Ford Escort he contemplates telling the police. He almost burns the journal but reads on. In the next entry she describes doing the same thing.

* Remember therefore from whence thou art fallen, and repent. - Revelations, 2:5

* Will: He goes for a walk and finds a bar, orders a burger and a large draft of beer. He asks to use the phone and leaves an anonymous tip with the police about the body. He decides that’s it and when he returns home he puts the journal away in a storage box in the closet, a decisive end to his curiosity. Very decisive indeed, a voice mocked him later in the middle of night, when he was tossing in his bed, unable to sleep, But you didn’t throw it away.

* Do not ask me for my opinion. I do not know — that is all. HP Lovecraft, The Color Out of Space

* I think the problem with Laird Barron is that his writing is too eloquent and ‘le mot just’ and therefore feels safe in a way that undercuts any horror the story contains. With his work I feel like I’m comfortably removed from anything too disturbing to my worldview. Compare this to Ligotti, whose work feels truly dangerous, like the ground has crumbled away beneath your feet, exposing you to the raw void.

* The story of a photojournalist who took a photo of a starving child who died and then soon thereafter killed himself.

* Maybe contacting the person on the dark web initiates some kind of trial, like the blue whale, which gets increasingly hallucinatory and culminates in the discovery of rabbit and the book in the clermont hotel.

* Maybe he has to take a pill as part of it. Maybe it asks him to commit suicide, which he will not do.

* They frame him for murder of rabbit using the knife he used for something else, when he was trying to rescue something.

* You have to communicate your progress to a 'curator'. Maybe the curator is the one he speaks with in the end.

* Before you get any deeper, be sure this is what you want.

* The trials have him hurt things, starting small.

* He is threatened to do the trial, ending with the words of entrance.

* Could there be a parallel in the trials and abigail’s deteriorating spirit?

* They both snap at a woman in a queue. He snaps at a woman. She snaps at a man.

* The trials happen via a smartphone that is left in a park under a statue. Remember the number 3365.
 The phone is locked with that code. On the phone is a text message,

* By unlocking this phone you have begun the initiation. Reply OK if you understand.

* Read and understand.

* The horror needs to be universal, hers 'How thin the walls that sheltered me...', his is believing he is impartial to the suffering in the world, but turning out not to be.

* Need to make sure you establish why Abigail keeps writing the journal, in a plausible way.

* Make sure the dates of the journal line up with the timeline of Will's narrative, time of year, weather.

* Second chapter picks up back at home, feeling good about his first day, describe new apt, walk down the street for dinner, slowly turn to computer, what he discovers about Abigail. Sees an email about having to be out from a death in the family. Looks up her profile on intranet, has photo, birthday, hobbies, contact information including phone, address. Finds photo album of her with her mother on a cruise. That turns his thoughts to his own family and friends, with whom he is now estranged. End with him feeling deeply, deeply alone. Third Chapter: A week passed...

* Second chapter needs a narrative draw, maybe getting the reminder to write in journal. By the third chapter he’s still receiving the notification, every other day. But still hasn’t found it, which leads into his drive by her house.

* And then he emerged momentarily from the thoughts stirring in his brain and looked around in the dark, in bed, in the bedroom, in the apartment, in the city, and in the perfect stillness of three in the morning he realized he was and had been deeply, deeply alone.

* It’s very important for Abigails scenes to flow from one another instead of being episodic, so that you can trace everything back, so that it’s all related.

* Chapter Two: It’s a downpour, driving home

* Chapter 4
Start of journal
Ends with Adairsville memory of mother

* Chapter 5
Meeting man who lives in the room
Should end immediately after, or maybe with the passage about ‘he never left...’
Do not end with her happy. That happens at beginning of next Abigail chapter

* Actually Chapter 4 is actual house visit. So Chapter 5 is Start of journal.

* The man in the room is not some symbol for drug abuse or ‘the man’ as in a pusher. But there is a relationship between them. Drugs are not a means within themselves, they are used to fill some deeper hole. The man is interested in this void that is growing within Abbie.

* Abigail's story: April - June, Will's story: January - March
  This will give a space of 6 months between their working at the same place

* Maybe all of Will’s chapters should be roughly the same length, while Abigail’s vary. 


### Writing

* You have to believe in the story as a reality. You have to believe in your own ability to create it. Hold nothing back out of fear. Believe!

* Be suggestive, not pornographic in detailing both sex and violence.

* Only use description to describe the environment, people, atmosphere, not to project metaphors or other ideas you have. Keep it about the reality of story’s world. In other words don’t write like the previous reply (He rounds a hill and sees the skyline of the city spread before him, half a million lights coalesced into a glow...). This is important if you want readers to feel the uncanny when it comes.

* Bukowski does a great thing in his books. His chapters have an ability to resonate outside their boundaries. You feel you're getting only a slice of a larger story.

* Evoke the nominus. *numinous.

* Trust the reader to fill in the gaps. Make them participate in the storytelling!

* Samuel Delaney on what makes a believable character: purposeful, habitual, and gratuitous actions

* At some time between first and final draft, you must ask yourself of each sentence, “What is it saying?” and “What is it doing?” Next, ask if there is any way to make it say it more intensely, or do it with more bravura. Even better, is there any way to make the sentence be an example of what it’s about? Failing that, is there a way to get the sentence to say, do, or be something that supports the basic statement in an interesting way? Ask yourself if any part of the sentence gets in the way of (prepositional phrases, frequently toward the sentence’s end, are often the worst offenders—also, parenthetical phrases or dangling ideas) the sentence’s doing its job as economically as possible. Can that part be reduced or eliminated? - Samuel Delaney

* Things you do in writing to avoid:
1) overly verbose sentences
2) rushing through scenes (pacing)
3) using flowery dialogue attributions
4) lazy description, narration

* Microincidence, micronarrative

* Break all chapters into scenes. Understand each scene’s purpose before you begin the chapter.

* Think about the micro-narratives happening at both scene and chapter level. Consciously develop them and be sure to resolve them in a satisfactory way.

* “The great enemy of clear language is insincerity. When there is a gap between one’s real and one’s declared aims, one turns as it were instinctively to long words and exhausted idioms, like a cuttlefish spurting out ink.”
― George Orwell, Politics and the English Language

* You can approach the act of writing with nervousness, excitement, hopefulness, or even despair--the sense that you can never completely put on the page what's in your mind and heart. You can come to the act with your fists clenched and your eyes narrowed, ready to kick ass and take down names. You can come to it because you want a girl to marry you or because you want to change the world. Come to it any way but lightly. Let me say it again: you must not come lightly to the blank page.

* Write in scenes, not chapters. How many scenes per chapter is down to rhythm. Whatever feels right.

* Start scenes late as possible. End with a punch, narratively or emotionally.


### Abigail

* The horror of watching yourself become something you don’t recognize. Losing your humanity without being able to stop.

* And as the feeling of numbness went away there was left a hole. Deep and wide. Crying out like a child to be filled. I became more and more depraved. Oh God please forgive the things I’ve done. I dove into the deep web. Forgive me.

* Alicia Dodgson

* (re: argument with mother?) You are a good soul. A precious being. And I had forgotten that being caught up in what seemed so important at the time.

* Regrets every harsh word she spoke or thought about her mother.

* She describes a dream in which she is on a strange world millions of light years from the Earth. The landscape is strange and the rules of our world do not seem to apply. An enormous sun overtakes the sky and chars the surface, destroying all life.

* A memory of a cool, summer night when they lived in a trailer out in Adairsville, katydids chirping in the nearby thickets, on her stomach in the living room in front of the box fan on its highest setting, melting crayon tips against the spinning center of the blades, mother in the kitchen frying up chicken, dancing to music on the radio as she worked. She watched her mother through the spinning blades of the fan and breathed in the thick aroma of hot oil and flour. And I had a feeling I wasn’t able to understand then, but do now, of love and pure happiness and most of all a deep faith in the goodness of all things.

* She works with a pimp and they rob johns.

* She does things for cruelty’s sake. Puts glass shards in the dirt of a playground...etc

* She thinks good thoughts to block out the hurt

* She tried to think of a good memory, but there was none left within her.

* People bring out your true potential, or else it doesn't blossom. You might spend your entire life dormant.

* She lay there after in the dark and quiet of the hotel room. Her mind drifted to memories of a lost time, of the backyard at her maw maw and paw paws, of them smiling and helping her on a little pink tricycle, pedaling on the grass, her maw maw with the crippled fingers. And she wondered how it was that moment time no longer existed in this reality. And it made her heart sick and she wanted to die rather than live one more day in a world where such things happen. And tears fell from her eyes in the dark and quiet of that hotel room, and no one else in the room knew of her tears.

* Sometimes it was like we were complete strangers who knew everything about each other. She made me so frustrated I wanted to scream and still I knew I couldn’t live without her. No, not exactly that. I couldn’t live without her being there. It was like she was the Sun and I was the Earth. Everything I was only made sense in my relation to her. And now the sun had burned out and I was suddenly a planet adrift, abandoned, alone in a dark, vast universe that cared nothing about me.

* She writes an entry seething at her mother and then apologizing

* Where does the anger come from? I feel ashamed of the way I feel.

* She didn’t believe in goodness anymore. As a concept yes but not in it’s reality. She reflected on the things in her life that she had always believed to be examples of goodness and saw only selfishness, greed, and manipulation. A part of her still longed to believe in goodness but it could not be.

* Give illustrations of benevolent acts and then deconstruct them to a self-interested core.

* When she kills him, it is like all the rage and anger had left me and all that remained was pity for him, suffering and alone, in that room that was his prison.

* She buys things on credit, becoming obsessed with acquiring material possessions.

* She feels overcome by a delirium where at the same time she is aware she is doing wrong and does not care.

* She regrets the time she did not spent with her mother. She remembers a night when they were doing nothing, her in her room on Instagram, her mother in the living room playing games on her iPad. Why didn’t I go and speak to you? I could have asked about your day? I could have brought you a coke from the fridge. I would do anything to have another chance to do that just one more time. But it can never be. Not ever again.

* We could have talked. I could have told you about the memory I have when I was seven and we lived in that trailer up in Adairsville...and you were in the kitchen and me on the floor in front of that dirty old box fan, melting crayons on the spinning hub...

* She remembered a time when her beliefs and dreams had been pure and good. It made her heart ache that she had lost them now, forever.

* I felt understood (by the man who lives in the room)

* Abigail Echols

* She writes an entry that she cannot remember a memory she previously wrote down. She is afraid. What is wrong with me? I don’t want to forget who I am. It’s all I have left in the world.

* Her mind twists into believing it would be better had she never been born. Her journal ends with; Mama (dried tears stain the page)

* She wonders whether life will always get better. And decides that no. It has no obligation to do that. And we have to live with that knowledge. A dog does not. That is what makes us human, the awareness of our predicament. Besides the anti-natalism she grows to resent her mother and what she stands for.

* We cannot ignore the inferno.

* She begins with sex and drugs, then when money runs out she starts tricking, then robbing, then violence.

* You ain’t a bitch. You just ain’t there at all.

* ...my faith, even though I didn’t know to call it that back then. It was faith, a deep faith in the goodness of all things.

* How precarious life is. How delicate.

* How delicate the parts that separate a person from happiness and endless despair.

* What a mess my life turned out to be...

* Her first journal entry should talk about death of mother, how she is unable to sleep, unable to be in the house not from the bad but good memories. Then into day she meets mwlir

* She has a moment where she laughs and becomes guilt-ridden. Someone tells a joke?

* Abigail finds something that reminds her of a bad memory, a fight she and her mother had (a grapefruit spoon) and cries all night regretting it, wishing she could take it back.

* A doll. She wanted a Cabbage Patch Kid but her mom couldn't afford it and got her a knock-off. Her mom was so excited to give it to her and she could see the hurt in her eyes when Abigail started crying.

* She gets an STD, HIV, Herpes? Incurable for sure

* Maybe not

* She feels as if she is living inside of a deep dream.

* Abigail doesn't want to admit, even to herself, that she is slipping. She 'puts on a brave face'. It should be endearing at first, and then sad.

* She writes gibberish. She doesn’t care.

* 'A memory of a cool, summer night when they lived in a trailer out in Adairsville, katydids chirping in the nearby thickets, on her stomach in the living room in front of the box fan on its highest setting, melting crayon tips against the spinning center of the blades, mother in the kitchen frying up chicken, dancing to Reba McEntyre on the radio as she worked. She watched her mother through the spinning blades of the fan and breathed in the greasy aroma from the frying pan. I was overcome by emotions I wasn’t able to articulate then, but can now, of love and true happiness and most of all a deep faith in the goodness of all things.'

This quote should be in the first journal entry. She has been told to remember something good about her mother...

* How precarious it all was. How thin the walls that protected me from a despair with no end.

* How precarious it all was. How thin the walls that protected me against a despair without end.

* How precarious it all was, looking back. How thin the walls that sheltered me my entire life from a despair that has no end.

* How precarious it all was, looking back. How thin those walls that sheltered me all my life against a despair that has no end.

* How precarious it all was, looking back. How thin the walls that sheltered me all my life against a despair that has no end.

* April 9
Mentioned to Dr. Patel during our appointment today that I kept a diary back in high school and he suggested it could be helpful for me to start a new one. To "get all these feelings out of your head and onto paper" as he put it. So this is me starting a new one. Still not sure about it and I don't really feel like diving into things right at this moment, but I wanted to write something at least so I can tell him I'm doing it.

* he suggested it could be helpful for me to start a new one as part of my therapy.

* April 10
Today I was pulling out of the Walmart parking lot, waiting at the red light, and right in front of me a Honda turning into the lot was t-boned by a pickup truck with a rebel flag in the back window. It happened right in front of me. I saw the windshield shatter, the airbag deploy, the lady in the car whiplashed, all in slow motion. It was shocking. I felt a sense of responsibility to do something to help. At the same time I was in traffic, there were also cars behind me, waiting. The light turned green and I made a wide turn to avoid the wreckage and continued down the road. Did I do something wrong? A part of me says no, but there's another part of me that says yes. It's a smaller voice, but it's there. I think you should help people in life. Today I failed to do that and my guilt is my conscious re-affirming that to me. I can rationalize and tell myself it was better for me to get out of the way, that I would have just caused more problems if I stopped to help. But bullshit. I should have done something. And I didn't. I have a feeling I'll still think back on this day fifty years from now, when I'm old and shriveled up. Maybe on my death bed I'll remember this day and still feel this pang of regret. If mama was still here I could tell her about it and she would tell me not to worry. But she's not.

* April 16
Lexapro is starting to work. I think. Finding it easier to sleep. Dr. Patel said it could take up to two weeks to achieve the full effect. In our appointment today I told him I started this journal based on his recommendation. He was glad to hear that. He asked what I wrote so far and I told him about the accident at the traffic light and how it made me feel guilty. He reassured me that in a public place that is a common feeling. The Bystander Effect, he said it's called. Perhaps I could have stopped or called the police, but that it was perfectly normal to react how I did. Weirdly, him saying that made me feel better. Like lifted a weight I had been carrying around all week, from that little thing. He asked me to write down some good memories about my mother in the journal. That it "doesn't have to be all bad feelings". I told him I would. Just not today. Tomorrow.

* I wish I never found that room. I wish I had never gone inside. There is so much I don’t understand and never will.

* I feel...happy. I really do. Wanted to tell somebody (even if it's just me).

* I awoke to find a pit had opened in the floor of my bedroom, my mother’s bedroom, where I now slept. And looking into it I could see that it had no bottom. Everything would, I knew, eventually fall into this pit, and it paralyzed me. And then somehow I realized I was dreaming and the pit was a part of my dream but that also it was a part of me, and then I woke up.

I’m sorry for not always being a good daughter to you. I’m sorry for putting you second. All those times when I saw you were down and didn’t ask how you were.

* Abigail is like the girl in the play, gentle, kind - she is waifish, always wearing a cardigan, short bob of hair exposing a delicate collar bone. Think a young Olivia Williams.

* April 23
Happy. Truly I am. Last night I had the most peaceful sleep and only good dreams. Tomorrow I will write more. Today is for me.

* It started one night when I couldn’t sleep. Going down the internet rabbit hole I somehow ended up on Craigslist personals...

* But I wasn’t there to meet a man. I was there cause some girl on a message board said that’s how she scored when money was tight and she was feeling the burn.

* For the life of me I don’t know what I was thinking. It seems crazy now, looking back. And I do remember thinking, this is not safe Abbie, even as I got out of the car and approached the pathway. It was getting late, already after sunset...

* This is not safe Abbie, you don’t know this man.

* I miss her so much. I just want her to be alive. No one prepares you for this pain. Maybe no one can. No one prepares you for this much hurt.

* I miss her so much. I just want her to be alive. No one prepares you for this much hurt. The center of my world is gone.

* I am driftless. Alone in the cosmos. A planet without a sun.

* How do I live? How can I?

* "You're mine baby. I gave you drugs, you're mine forever."
And I liked it.
The man she meets in browsing personals ends up being her drug source, pimp, that she kills.

* I was in a tunnel. I didn’t want happiness because it would betray her memory.

* But now I think I can, of home and pure happiness and most of all a deep faith in the goodness of all things.

* pure love

* I was overcome by a feeling I wouldn't have been able to articulate back then, but can now I think, of home and pure love and most of all a deep faith in the goodness of all things.

* Time was so short. And then gone.

* I was overcome by feelings I wouldn't have been able to articulate as a nine year old girl, but can now I think, of home, and pure love, and most of all a deep faith in the goodness of all things.

* I was overcome by a feeling I wasn’t able to fully understand as a nine year old girl, but do now I believe — of home, and unconditional love, and most of all a deep faith in the goodness of all things.

* Today I watched an episode of The Office. It was the one where Michael...and I caught myself giggling like an idiot...and caught my reflection in the glass of the entertainment center. I turned it off. I don't want to be happy. I don't want to laugh.

* 

all I want is for you to be alive again
to see your radiance
to feel your warmth
nobody warned me
about the darkness
now I am driftless
alone in the void
a planet without a sun

* Then I was overcome by a feeling I wasn’t able to fully understand as a nine year old girl, but do now I believe — of home, of unconditional love, but most of all a deep faith in the goodness of all things.

* all I want is for you to be alive again to see your radiance to feel your warmth nobody warned me about the darkness now I am driftless alone in a void a planet without a sun


### Will

* He IS the man who lives in the room, the cause of the previous worker’s suicide. The man who committed suicide is in despair after his mother passed away. He writes his confessions in git, overwriting the previous entries.

* Your role is to feed our Master. Do you accept this honor? I do. With all your heart? And with all your mind, forever until the return of Shoggoth Ur? Yes. People will bring you food for our Lord. And you will bring this food to him. Others have taken this role and are remembered to this day. Jesus of Nazareth...etc. I don’t understand. How will I know what to do? What people will come? From where?

* Before being told of role he explores outside and walks into an ancient world. He is brought a sick child but cannot help it and it dies.

* He grows old in the room. Waiting.

* He feels a connection, as if their fates are bound together in some way he can’t articulate.

* Becomes obsessed with learning about her, is drawn to her beauty, looks up her address. 

* After reading first entry, where she meets the man who lives in the room, he feels guilty, like he’s exploiting her troubled mind for his own amusement and puts the journal away, planning to return it eventually. Then one evening after work he finds himself driving aimlessly through the city and drives past the murder Kroger. Investigates bit does not find the door. This causes him to reopen the journal, where he learns of her troubles after.

* He doesn’t make eye contact with people. Is that normal? He wonders.

* Wants to bring them to justice

* It would be impossible to gauge how much time had passed inside the room, but by now his skin was quite wrinkled, his hair mostly fallen out, and his thoughts much of the time muddled and confused. He had spend his time in the room reflecting on the nature of Kthadras and of all the things he was blessed to have been shown by him. So it filled his heart with gratitude when at last he heard the doorknob turn and in walked a woman, pensive and alone. He then rose and faced her, smiling. “Where are you hurting, Abigail?”

* He reflected on the reality of Kthadras and how much of his life he had spent not even aware of His presence.

* As he stared at the inhuman form of Kthadras he saw himself as if from behind, his own consciousness in retreat until he was staring at the back of his own head.

* He felt compelled to help her, which he was aware seemed paradoxical, and yet he felt that way.

* He saw the form of the abomination and understood at last. He understood 'Kthadras' was not it’s name at all, but instead the name human beings had given to it three hundred thousand years ago. Clearly he understood this formless corporeality had no name and could not ever.

* Words to describe it came into his head. Words like tentacled. And yet there were no tentacles. Slimy but there was no slime. Only those who have witnessed it could ever understand what that meant. The closest thing to looking at it that we have would be a hallucination. A storm of strange matter, collapsing forever in on itself, a vortex of blood, skin, bone, muscle, and sinew.

* He wept at it’s reality.

* Make it very clear his desire to protect her, even after death. To right the wrong of her death. And to restore justice.

* He wanted very much to protect her, understanding how paradoxical that feeling was and yet feeling that way just the same.

* I woke in the night feeling like I was suffocating. Like I was confined in an uncomfortable space and wanted to move but couldn’t. I remembered a movie about Vietnam where prisoners of war were kept in a small wooden box with small air holes for days at a time. The thought of a torture like that wouldn’t leave my mind. I wanted to die. Better to die than that.

* He didn’t want to save her. That made no sense anyway. But it was something like that, in a way, he supposed. What he really wanted was to protect her memory and also to bring whoever it was to, justice? But that was bullshit and he couldn’t keep up that line of self-delusion for very long. No, the simple and only truth of it was, he wanted to _know_.

* I wait because it waits.

* He wakes in the middle of the night and feels an unbearable loneliness and a fear that is unplaceable but very real. He longs for Abigail and feels she would understand.

* His thoughts turn to feeling isolated from society and its values. His work is meaningless and he knows it. He has daydreams of walking away from it all, maybe walking cross country. When he discovers Abigail's journal he feels a sense of purpose again.

* He goes for a drive in the night after these thoughts?

* He rounds a hill and sees the skyline of the city spread before him, half a million lights coalesced into a glow that radiates into the black and starless skies above. He wonders how many of the people are asleep right now, visiting strange worlds filled with strange inhabitants that flames brightly for a few hours and then goes out forever.

* Millions of souls asleep and dreaming of strange, wonderful, and perhaps horrifying worlds that live only a few hours and then blink out of existence forever. In these dreams they process the mundane problems of waking life, reunite with loved ones dead or estranged, and fulfill the secret wishes of their hearts.

* Millions of souls asleep and dreaming of surreal, wonderful, and even terrifying worlds that live only a few hours of time and then blink out of existence forever. In these dreams we process the mundane problems of waking life and fulfill the deepest and most secret wishes of our hearts. Weird shit if you thought about it long enough. Fucking weird.

* He is the one who wakes with feelings of suffocation, remembers being locked in a small wooden box, where he can’t move.

* brother in diapers. Once we were so close, but I haven’t spoken to him since Christmas. That makes me very sad.

* What had begun as a morbid curiosity had now changed. He felt as if he were connected to Abigail’s suffering and wanted to reach across time itself to do what, help? Yes. Somehow he wanted to help this woman who had been dead for more than half a year.

* Across the threshold of time and space

* Across the barrier of time and space

* Give Will a wry sense of humor that makes him a bit aloof from the people around him.

* His vision of Kthadras is a psychedelic vision

* Will is estranged from his family. Years of bitterness and resentments that grew into a wall of briars between them.

* After cursing out his mother: He knew he was in the wrong but pride had prevented him so far from taking any steps towards reconciliation. The thought of apologizing to his mother or any of the rest turned him sour, going through that whole predictable charade. He didn't have the energy anymore. Best just let it die.

* He wrestles with reaching out to his mother but his pride won’t let him. He is unable to forgive.

* He felt restless, rootless, and deeply, deeply alone.

* He takes down his dating profile but cannot say why.

* Nervous breakdown. That was the phrase nobody had ever said to him, but he had seen it in their eyes and heard it in their voices. His family and friends. Estranged now, for one reason or another. This was a beginning. A new job in the city, a new apartment in a hip, gentrified neighborhood in the Poncey-Highlands.

* Estranged now, because of the things he had said and done. Things you can’t take back.

* The deeply, deeply alone sentence should come in chapter two.

* He realized he had spent all night inside his own head and only now did he notice the overwhelming stillness of his apartment.

* The weight of his isolation in this strange and  silent city bore down on him and he felt it as a physical sensation, on his shoulders, behind his eyes, and even in his heart. He was sick in his heart and utterly alone.

* Now the weight of his isolation...

* Becoming estranged from his family and friends was not something he had planned for or really wanted. It just happened, one small gesture at a time, not calling back his sister, not being there for his best friend when he asked help to move. And then there was the Thanksgiving debacle, a final blowup that severed all connection for months. It wasn’t that they never spoke at all, a phone call here a text there, but something had been lost. Something that didn’t even have a name really, but now that it was gone he missed it terribly. All he had to do would be to reach out, say forget all this, forgive me as I have forgiven you. All we have in this world are the brief moments of being together. But every time he seriously considered picking up the phone there was something inside him that pulled back, that didn’t want to face the awkwardness and the bringing into light things that had long lived in darkness. He hated it. Everything about it. It made him feel suffocated and more than anything else he longed to breathe free again. But he just couldn’t. Or wouldn’t. And here we are.

* All those moments gone. He was very close to his baby sister once, though nineteen years apart they made up games in the backyard and made impromptu ice cream runs in late summer evenings. But now they were merely polite to one another other, as you would be to someone in line with you at the bank. She was grown, living out of state. But he did love her.

* He was sick in his heart and deeply, deeply alone.

* He just, liked her. And he was mature enough to appreciate how rare that is to find in the world, liking someone.

* He was sick in the heart and deeply alone.

* On the drive home a deluge. He screams until stars appear in his periphery. This outburst of anger shocks him, as he didn't think he was upset.


### Rabbit

* The pendant is in the con mans mouth

* His name is Rabbit. He’s a black albino.

* Rabbit attacks him, saying ‘Gimme dat key, gimme dat key’.

* Motherfucker ran so slow he coulda run a whole other marathon before he finished the first one.

* He would come out with these bizarre non-sequiters from time to time, for example he told me about a cousin of his from Lafayette who ran long distance races, and I quote: “Motherfucker ran so slow he coulda run a whole other marathon before he finished the first one” Things like that, things that sounded normal if you weren’t paying attention but once your brain began processing the meaning of it it made less and less sense.

* "Sometimes it's like my brain got a mind of its own, know what I mean?" Rabbit says this disorienting phrase when they are driving.

* Word Salad

* He told me he liked cars and was going to put a new exhaust on his 92 Mustang GT, so you can really hear that engine purr. Then he said he had a cat and he was going to put an exhaust on it too one day. His brain went like that, one topic bleeding into another, making less and less sense.

* "Sometimes it be like my brain got a mind of his own, know what I'm sayin?"


### Work (Sanctuary Park)

* Someone follows him to his car after his first day at work and tells him about Alicia's suicide. He tells him he forwarded him an email she sent to the entire company they day before they found her. She hung herself apparently. Nobody knows why, except that she was depressed over her mother.

* Sometimes we would go for walks down by the pond behind the office. She didn’t have anything else to offer after that, looking to him with some kind of anticipation. He had nothing to give her.

* She was a beautiful soul.

* Of course it doesn’t work, why would it?

* For some reason it went through his mind what it would be like if he took off all his clothes right now and walked inside the building very business-like, buck ass naked, and then in the next moment censuring himself. Normal people don’t think about things like that, Will. Don’t be weird.

* The scene where the woman tells him about the suicide, the wind is rising and a storm is approaching.

* The sun comes out at lunchtime. They go to the cafeteria in the main building and sit outside. They tell stories about programming and he is wondering the entire time about Abigail. Maybe he keeps talking about her in hopes someone will talk about it.

* He can see her personal calendar, which she has linked into her work schedule. Dates with a psychiatrist...etc.

* Why is it everyplace you work there has to be at least one asshole? They joke at lunch. And if there isn’t one, it may be you! I’ve never worked with an asshole.

* They found her hanged in her mother's bedroom closet. She had been dead for three days when they found her. Neighbors said there was an awful smell. That's all I know.

* Imagining his naked walk inside, he references the imp of the perverse by Poe.

* Sounds like Abbie really left you guys high and dry. *crickets*

* As he watches the workers walk from the parking lot to the building, he feels a lurking despair — this will be my life from now on. Day in, day out. Here is the routine.

* Abigail passed away. About six months ago now. It was -- she committed suicide. They found her hanging in a closet, in her mother's bedroom closet. They said she -- I'm really sorry. I had no idea. They didn't tell me. Some days me and her would walk down to the pond, down that path yonder, on our lunch break. We would talk about things. Office gossip. Family stuff. You know. She was a beautiful soul, Abigail was. And so kind to me.

* Chapter Three
A week passed. Starts at work, in a meeting, Will demoing his automation script, and being praised for it. During his talk he gives credit to Abigail, to which there are murmurs and stern looks. There is a party, with drinks, he gets a little drunk and it’s late before he drives home, driving by the address. He goes inside...dream vision.

* slits of rain appeared on the windshield...


### Murder Kroger

* The place is below the Murder Kroger. The Man Who Lives in the Room. He takes away feelings of sorrow. The place links to the past and the future. Somehow the Dark Web is involved.

* The portal is in the back of the Bad Places, which here is the Murder Kroger. The portal is The Room.

* Con man is in the hatchback of an old Chevy Citation, blown wheels, covered with pollen. He sees a flickering light inside, smells a putrid odor, hears the buzzing of insects, opens the hatch and sees his dismembered body of the con man arranged in an asymmetrical pattern, surrounded by burning candles. The egg pendant inside his mouth.

* He runs in horror from the dismembered con man, into the woods, where he sees a meteor shower, an aurora, then comes across a dinosaur.

* Under the light of the nebula he stumbles upon the sleeping dinosaur, who opens its eye and looks at him.

* He emerged into the grocery store next to the fresh seafood counter. He bought some Cheez-Its on the way out and ate them on way back to McDonalds, taking the sidewalk up Ponce de Leon.

* Maybe something needs to replace rabbits death scene, maybe it comes too early - but then how does he get the pendant - perhaps he is attacked by rabbit, pulls the pendant from around his neck and escapes into the woods? That would allow building to the death of rabbit to attain the book, ratcheting the tension in a more linear way, while still indicating danger to him.



### State Hospital (Virginia)

* Maybe instead he has a surreal encounter with a man who he thinks he's running from but ends up being afraid of him.

* There is a chase through a surreal (how?) building, room to room. He is being chased by someone with a knife. Then he is attacked and is stabbed, bleeding out the lights come on and he is the one holding the knife, a black albino is on the floor, bleeding out. "Don't kill me man. Don't kill me." He looks with horror at the knife and drops it, then looks in a satchel he is carrying - the book.

* Give a reason for the hallucination, a strange smell, a fume of some kind.

* The state hospital he must approach from a certain place, time, and orientation. That is what explains the surreal atmosphere.

* The state hospital, one room the walls, floors, and ceiling are fluid and they swim through.

* He was laughing. Laughing at me.

* In the asylum he sees a skull, emerging from a storm with lightning

* Maybe the man at state hospital shouldn’t laugh, play it more real in the moment.


### Will's Apartment

### Abigail's Apartment

* (Dream) Sees her try to light the journal on fire, put it out, then hide it instead.

* Has a dream he visits the house and discovers a journal when her hung body with tentacles for a face point at the dresser. He wakes up, unaware he was dreaming. It’s the middle of the night. The house is the same as his dream. He finds the journal.

* The place looks like his dream, except reverse. And darker. He uses phone as flashlight.

* Exploring the house he sees his reflection in the mirror and is startled.

* Once the idea was planted within his brain it would not leave him alone. It seemed wrong and inwardly he even asked himself, can a person do things like this? Somewhere inside he knew he wanted his inner voice to reassure him. Don't be silly, of course not. There are laws prohibiting such things. But that voice never came and he knew that as long as no one found out, a person could do things like this. And worse things, if need be.

* While exploring the house, Will sees an old doll on the bed next to the pillow, maybe it startles him.


### The Goat Farm (Art Center)

* You think you are safe. You are not safe. Thanks, I’ll watch my back. It’s not your back I would worry about. What should I worry about then? Your soul.

* You’re too cocky. He laughed. You think you’re safe...

* You still think you’re safe...

* Places like the Murder Kroger are areas where Kthadras has broken through the shell and manifested himself in the everyday world.

* Why are you looking at me that way? You’ve been giving me these looks this whole time. This bemused look, and I don’t like it. Do you not take me seriously? I admit I do find you a bit amusing. I apologize. My mother never taught me manners. But why are you amused? This is not a joke to me. It’s been keeping me awake. I have barely slept. I laugh to myself, and I do apologize for that, because you still think you’re merely an observer to all the horrible and tragic events you’ve uncovered here. You still think you can close the journal anytime you like and simply walk away. In a word, you still think you’re safe. You are not safe.

* This professor woman is giving a lecture, which he attends, at which she explains the origin of the Kthadras myth...with all brethren forming the planets of our solar system, sanctums in the nomenclature of the adherents. He speaks to her about the pendant and discloses the journal. She smiles at the end and he blows up. She grabs his hand and he sees a tattoo of the egg symbol on her wrist. You are not safe.

* Impartial observer. In the vernacular of the adherents

* I admit I do find your situation a tad amusing. This is not a joke to me...

* I’m not sure it was a suicide. Murder? I don’t know. I feel like this group took advantage of her somehow, drugged her, whatever. How else do you explain the things she’s described. How indeed.

* (She is not in the Order) The professor cannot help him get into the room, however, there is a book that describes the inner workings of the Order. It is not published and cannot be found on the World Wide Web, as far as I know. But I have a contact for such arcana, obscure primary texts, that sort of thing. I could give him your information and tell him what you are looking for? He’s a strange guy (at least I think he’s a guy) but reliable. Please do that. I have this feeling Alicia’s suicide is not what it appears to be. And I want to find out more before I do anything like going to the police. Out of curiosity, may I ask why? I don’t want them to dismiss me as some lunatic and fail to give it the proper attention. On paper this sounds completely insane. So I want to have all my ducks in a row. And what else? Why are you smiling at me that way? You’ve had this look the whole time we’ve been speaking. Do you know something? Tell me Goddamnit! Her smile faded and she took a moment to collect her thoughts. I apologize. I’m sorry. Okay? This amateur detective work of yours is amusing to me, and my mother didn’t teach me any manners. But let me ask you one question, have you ever stopped for one moment to reflect on your current situation? What do you mean? It’s all I can think about. It’s eating me up inside. Obviously. But what I mean is, you still believe you are nothing but an impartial observer...

* What I mean is, you reach out to me and tell me this bizarre story of a woman’s death, looking for clues like you’re Colombo or something, just ‘workin a case ma’am’, you see what I mean? But that’s not what’s really going on here. It’s as clear as day, you just haven’t recognized it yet. You still think you’re nothing more than a concerned citizen, an impartial observer to the tragedy you’ve uncovered. You still think you can close that journal anytime you like, maybe make an anonymous phone call to the police, and then go on with your life, just like it was before. But you are a part of this story now. A role has been written for you and you are playing it at this very moment, by coming to speak with me. Don’t you see that? To put it more bluntly, because I can see by your reaction that you’re not seeing it — you still think you’re safe. She reached out and grabbed his hand and squeezed it hard, as you would to wake someone who was inside of a deep dream. You are not safe.

* There is a handbook of some kind, a practical guide the Order uses to conduct it’s rituals. It may have the information you require. I’ve never seen it myself. My man on the inside claims he can get a copy for me, but it doesn’t come cheap. That’s what has prevented me so far, on my shit salary. But if you were willing to pay the asking price?

* I’ll be speaking at the Anthropology and the Occult conference in Chattanooga over the weekend, you’re welcome to come by. I’d love to hear more of your story and to be perfectly honest take a gander at that pendant!

* Important that the lecturer gives him a contact on the deep web, accessed via Tor, then the arrangement to meet in a public place, Clairmont?

* You have this pendant because they want you to have it. Why don’t you see that?

* I believe they may be responsible for this woman’s death. Abigail? Yes. Not suicide then? They may have brainwashed her, I don’t know.

* You can’t save her. She’s gone. But if I can uncover the truth, then —

* Their role is to offer sustenance.

* Make it more explicit that the doctor thinks the mythology is bullshit but that the order is real (from Derek)

* One thing I’ve learned over years and years studying religion and occult belief systems. Human being’s capacity for self-delusion is very, very high.

* If you can imagine it, you can talk yourself into believing it.

* Kthadras is not a spiritual concept. That’s very important to keep in mind. It is a being just as much a part of the cosmos as you and me. It may not share our biology or chemistry or even our physics, but it is real. At least, to the adherents of the Order.

* There are no known artistic representations.

* What is he, it waiting for?
Laughter
That is a very good question that I don’t know the answer to, and unfortunately know one does. The best guess we have about that comes from a series of petroglyphs found in the mountains of Patagonia. *she flips to a slide of some old figures hewn into rock in a artificially lit cave* See the egg here, you remember that from the rubbings I showed you. And now, look what comes after. Anyone recognize it? 
A bird?
That’s right, and look at the direction the bird is facing, toward the egg. The direction is not insignificant. This particular series has been translated as ‘Sleeping, it awaits the return’
I told you we are a poor group, is Kthadras-lore-hunters. We have only straws to grasp at.
Laughter.

* The Whispers - that’s what they call the book of rituals, parables, we honestly don’t know what’s inside this thing. Or even whether it exists. There was a hoax in 1893. Someone created a book and sold it

* It is thought Moloch, referenced in the Old Testament may very well have been a sect of Kthadras. One of my good friends, Dr. Byron Matthews, a historian at the University of Maine, wrote a fascinating paper about just that subject. If you’d like to read it send me an email and I’ll forward it to you.

* One interesting fact about the sanctums is that they aren’t built, but instead discovered by the order. The sites for worship are chosen for being a known loci of a particular energy. I hesitate to say ‘evil’ because that is not a term the adherents use. But that is what most of us would call it. Places known for being haunted, locations where murders have taken place.

* What about priests? People who live within the sanctum walls, Will asked.
No clergy that we know about, no hierarchy at all really. Adherents is the only word we can find for those in the order. To my knowledge they don’t live in these places.

* Locus

* But what will happen when whatever is returning returns?

She shrugged. 
Chuckles around the room.

Welcome to my world. But you know, I sort of love the mystery of it all. What fun is knowing all the answers.

So, human beings are just like little insects on the shell of the earth egg?

You got it, babe.

Damn.

And what happens when the egg cracks?

Exactly!

* What if I told you that underlying all the great religions of the world - Christianity, Islam, Judaism, Hinduism, Buddhism was a belief system more ancient, more primeval. Lurking in the shadows of those more well-known belief systems. Well, that is what I’m here to tell you today. You have likely never heard of this religion or if it’s deity, but I can assure you it is unlike any you have ever encountered before. The earliest reference we have for the deity of this religion comes from petroglyphs uncovered deep within caves systems. Take a look at these, found in within the mountains of Patagonia, in southern Chile, dated by scientists to be at least one hundred and fifty thousand years old, written in red ochre. The earliest pronounceable reference comes from a Tamil text, here the same symbol is referred to as K’thadras.

* We forget in our daily lives that the universe remains a profound mystery to us. We don’t think about these things as we stand in line at Starbucks. I think it is healthy to remember that.

* But if I could get inside and talk to this man she met. He seems to know what’s going on. I feel like they were indoctrinating her, something.

* Where is love? Happiness.
You are ascribing human emotions and standards of morality to something beyond such concepts. They don’t consider him to be evil.

* Any more than you are evil when you accidentally step on a bug, or eat a hamburger. But what do they get from him. It doesn’t seem to contain any truths about our human existence.

* This religion seems, brutal, unloving, what do the adherents get from it? How does it fulfill their lives.

Well I think the simple answer to that is that it doesn’t. I would ask where you got the idea that religion is meant to fulfill you. That is a recent idea. Religion in its fundamental sense has always been about reconnecting with the origin of life. Fulfillment has nothing to do with it.

They would see his works everywhere. Look at what our life has become, unending consumption of material possessions, ravaging the earth, and remember who he is: 

consumer of the consumed, ravager of the ravaged

* Interestingly, this word K’thadras is not itself Tamilic. We think it is from an even more ancient language now lost to us. Like, for example, if I am speaking to you and throw in a Latin phrase here and there - you know, et cetera. Laughter.

* Interestingly, this word K'thadras is not itself Dravidian...

* The only scripture known to exist is a book, considered a living text that grows with each subsequent generation of adherents, which is referred to in the lost language as the Vothmwag-Ab (try saying that three times fast) but has been come to be known colloquially as The Book of Whispers.

* Myself and other scholars have attempted to procure a copy, I'm sure it's fascinating and we could learn so much more than we know now, but adherents are quite adept at keeping secrets. Hence the name, I suppose. But I'm always on the lookout, for any of you closet adherents in the audience today.

* Sumerian?


### The Room

* But it was not just that he was present in the room that filled me with that dread. Somehow I knew he lived here. That this was his home, this inhospitable room in the back of the Kroger. And the implications of that fact, the strangeness and plain incongruity of it, because this was no place to call home, that was what terrified me.

* The egg-shaped pendant fits into a slot in the door.

* I killed him in an act of rage and pity, the spike pierced his head like it was a bowl of jello. It went right through to his brain. He next squirmed and...

* The spike pushed into the skull like it was a soft, moldy piece of fruit.

* Tore into the skull like...

* Monkish robes, K’thadras

* There were no words to describe its nature. No human words. But there was a feeling, a deep sense of hopelessness and never-ending despair.

* Abigail: I can recall every detail of the room and yet if you were to ask me a simple question about it, like what is the color of the walls, I couldn’t tell you. How strange that sounds now that I’ve written it down.

* All the anger went out of me. I understood the man was as much of a victim of this as me when I saw the suffering in those still recognizable eyes.

* They don’t wear robes, instead they are dressed from cultures throughout history.

* Why should I seek out suffering? I don’t believe in that sort of thinking. You don’t need to do anything. Suffering will seek out you.

* Where are we? A place, a time, and an orientation.

* Where am I? You are in a time, a place, and an orientation.

* A certain place, a certain time, a certain orientation

* The walls of the room are pulsating, slowly, like the slow beating of a heart.

* The man's deterioration should expose his skull

* A diffuse light bathed the room and yet there was no fixture or lamp that I could see. The light reminded me of a particular alley...

* He lived in this strange room behind the Kroger on Ponce De Leon. And he never left. Don’t ask me how I know that. But I do.

* She reveals in journal that she kept mothers death from coworkers

* It looked like something out of a bad horror movie. But I was not afraid. Strangely, looking back.

* It felt almost physical in the way it happened. A vision he could never unsee. A knowledge he could never unknow.

* The transformation of the room is becoming the distant planet, like opening a portal, the man is disintegrating from this world.


### McDonald's

### George's (Bar and Grill)

* Will becomes frustrated and texts the number he was given by Dr. Burrows, offering 5000 upfront for a copy of the handbook. Fifteen minutes later he receives a reply: "ok" End of chapter

* He writes a text to his mother, but doesn't send it - "I'd like to talk, when you can. I need to" (changes it to 'want to' before not sending)


### The Man

* “He knew my name. He knew everything about me.”

* “What ails thee, Jerome?” The man who leads Jerome there is a member of the cult.

* People all throughout time come in through the door asking for help. He gives advice at first, then helping with aid. He has an experience in one time that indicates a healer, but only by suggestion. That is when Jerome walks in. This is the final chapter of the book. Healers throughout history have been his pawns, have served from the Room: Jesus, Mother Theresa...other examples through history. All to serve his will.

* ‘Where do you hurt, Jerome?’

* By killing him with a stake she sends his soul to the Other world. He is the nameless protagonist of The Fetus.

* The room is as you wish it to be, which I thought a strange way to put it. You see what you wish to see. I don’t wish anything. Of course you do.

* I don’t wish anything. But you do. All your life you do, because life is nothing but a wish. I don’t understand what you mean by that. You will. In time all will be revealed to you, as it was to me. And you will understand.

* "The room is as you wish it to be," which I thought was a strange way to put it. I told him I didn't wish anything. And I'll never forget what he said next. He seemed momentarily confused, taken aback really, his eyes squinting, his eyebrows furrowed. "But you do," he said at last, calmly and with utmost sincerity and conviction, "Your entire life is a wish."

* The world is his dream and we mere phantasms which haunt our corner of his dream for a brief time.

* Pain begets pain and hurt begets hurt and hatred begets hatred, all in the ceaseless maelstrom which is existence. There can be no end because there was no beginning. But what about love? Joy? Kindness? Forgiveness? These are delusions, hormonal discharges, biological sleights of hand, to help propagate the species. They are not real in the way that suffering is real. I don’t accept that. It is not a requirement of reality that you accept it. Insanity is a perfectly valid response.

* Your entire life is nothing but a wish.

* Your entire life is a wish.

* His embrace is compassion. He accepts yet he is not doing the harm.


### Weekly-Rate Motel

* She sees a woman out the window, pushing a stroller down the sidewalk and longs to be her, sees how far she is from that reality and it breaks her heart.

* Mother is wearing a t-shirt with a bluebird on it. She can't stand the bluebird.

* Where is your mama? I don't have a mama.

* She sees the phrase etched in the headboard, underneath - The Way of Force is Not the Way of Love. And her mind spins off, trying to figure out who could have written it. Was it a preacher, waylayed...

* The woman she watches is kind, helps her neighbor.

* She imagines killing the woman, but the actual killing is off page

* That bitch Margaret...I always knew she’d be the one to throw me under the bus. Well fuck it.

* Steve, in the background, we never learn much about him.

### The Book

* A crude sketch in the book of a man inside a box

* When he has the book, it is written in strange English, with words he does not understand. There is repeated reference to the ‘words of admittance’ but he cannot find them anywhere mentioned. As he is drifting off to sleep reading his vision blurs and he sees hidden text on the page, between the visible words. From this he learns the phrase which will open the door.

* What is it? Devourer of the devoured. Eater of the eaten. Consumer of the consumed. He is the one who waits.

* Eyes, his eyes, spanning untold and innumerable dimensions, gazing each into the others.

* All this existence is consumption and all that will ever exist is the consumption and mindless devouring unto the end of the world and even unto the end of time. All this we believe and all this we know.

* All existence is consumption and all that has ever existed or ever will exist is consumption and ceaseless devouring. This is what we believe and this is what we know.

* All existence is consumption and all that has ever existed and all that ever will exist is consumption and ceaseless devouring. This we see. This we know.

* All existence is consumption and all that has ever existed and all that ever will exist is consumption and ceaseless devouring. This is what we see. This is what we know.

* We offer sustenance to Him in the hope one day He will acknowledge our presence and recognize that we are his adherents. We know and accept that to Him we are amoeba. Less than amoeba. Less than that.

* We offer sustenance to Him in the hope one day He will acknowledge our presence and recognize that we are his true adherents. We know and accept that to Him we are amoeba. Less than amoeba. Less than that. Yet we serve and we offer.

* We offer in faith eternal. K’thadras piy gwam

* We offer in the hope one day He will know our presence and see that we are His true adherents. Yet we know and we accept that we are like the amoeba floating in stagnant waters to Him. Less than amoeba! We are less than that. Yet we serve in humility and we offer in faith eternal, K’thadras piy gwam

* floating in brackish waters to Him

* One whose eyes gaze from this dimension into the next, into yet another, a billion times over, one from another and back again, even to the very beginning of time - where the true home of such a one?



## The Fetus

### General

* Fetus as a conclusion to the story, a kind of redemption to his suffering?

* A voice within, yet not a voice. It comes over you like an urge or a compulsion. And it says, Eat not the fruit of this world. You think this will not make life here easy. He has joined with the band of scavengers who scour the plains and eat the ‘fruit’. Protect the fruit of this world. Join us. You are like us. We grow stronger the more we stay together.

* It was funny, well not funny at all, but fascinating. Before those words ‘you are one of us’ were uttered you don’t remember what you were, if you even had a corporeal existence at all. Yet as if the act of speaking those words made it so, you look down and find that you are in fact like them, though you lack the blackened carapace that seems to cover them all.

* A place where you can make things appear with your mind?

* Should feel like a discovery, each scene revealing something strange and mysterious about the world in which you are in.

* make it feel like Revelations, strange vision after strange vision, unfolding in front of our protagonists eyes. He is along for the journey until he decides to act and save the fetus.

* craft the narrative itself to pull the reader through. End first chapter as the protagonist crests an outcropping overlooking a valley, ‘you cannot believe your eyes.’ The protag eats the mud and debris, though there is no nutrition in it.

* protagonist is not aware he/she is not human, until the encounter with the carapaced hunters.

* Exploring the Ruins of a Once-Great Civilazation.

* You are filled with an inconsolable longing but for what exactly you do not know.

* You encounter a jellyfish-like enormity whose victims are visible within its belly, in various states of corruption. You see hopeless tentacled creatures lashing against the translucent membrane, in pain. You encounter a lightning storm that is conscious. It sends electricity out and moves with the wind. Everything in this place is about eating.

* Everything about you is consumption, unending.

* Everything here is consumption, unending.

* You hate what you see. And you are consumed by that hatred.

* he walks through a forest of old bones, gargantuan and fractal-shaped.

* you feel as if who you are or were faded is there but obscured, in a fog that will not blow through. There are times it comes into a clearing and you glimpse it better.

* a constant sense of unease, homesickness, nostalgia for a time and place you can’t remember.

* lured by a call from a ruined civilization 

* swallowed by an immensity, digested, then evacuated

* A storm of lightning and wind that had blown for thirty seven million years. Take shelter from the sunrise

* Seek shelter from the rising of the sun.

* On the alien world, a storm that never ends, until the sunrise burns the clouds away.

* You wonder where you have this idea of a better place, a better world of less struggle and less pain. If this is all there is and all that can be, why does your mind wander there?

* Should feel like Begotten.

* When the lifeform emerges from the milky ocean, the atmosphere has regenerated, the implication being perhaps millions of years has passed.

* The way of force is not the way of love.

* Should feel psychedelic, like a salvia Trip. The buildings in the city are portals to other dimensions. The lacteal sea.

* A lacteal fluid

* The world of the fetus is chaotic, the life, the geography, the physics - so his act of empathy is an anchor to something that makes sense.

* The eaters of the fetus try to recreate it, mechanical, dead, mundane work.

* He triumps over them by yielding to their violence.

* The story diverges at a single point, either resenting the fetus and trying to recreate the fetus by machine, or embracing the loss, descending and becoming a fetus

* The creatures appear transclucent though this is because his eyes can see through their flesh, like x-rays, rather 
than because their skin had that characteristic.

* A parable about a man who finds himself lost in a forest where the trees 
are barren and the ground is covered in leaves. The man is unable to remember his 
name or where he's from. He can't event remember long he has been walking. He 
discovers a strange fetus floating in a milky pond. In the surrounding forest 
there are creatures who want to harm the fetus and he protects it from them.

* An enormous sun that overtakes the sky and burns away the leaves.

* A blue nebula, with tentacles spread across the black firmament. Something so far from him, light years away. Something alluring. If wings sprouted from his back one day he would fly to it.

* The creatures black, hardened. Later learn they were burned by the sun.

* After he nutures the fetus and it departs, he can either stumble in sadness and clean 
himself in the milky waters, sinking in and discovering a world below the surface, where 
he loses his body and floats the surface as a fetus himself, nourished by the waters and a 
tendril from some depths.

* Or, he can grow bitter and angry and resent the fetus for leaving him, burned further, and 
join in with others who attack other fetuses, and those who want to protect them.

* If you join the creatures you learn they hide (in some weird way) during the sunrise, this 
implies that at one time they too protected fetuses, being exposed, and somehow turned.

* In the milk he joins with another being, a scene of making love, becomes the fetus.

* You call the things you see all around you trees, and rocks, and grass, and leaves, but not 
because they are really those things, but because that is how your mind is able to make sense of them. 
Your memory of those things creates the association, since they have the nearest relationship through 
both form and behavior. But then sometimes the thing you call a tree will bend down consciously 
and sniff around and the illusion is broken. But you can't help yourself. It's how the mind works.

* Depersonalized memories of Earth

* You remember others. Your mother. And father. You remember being loved. For a moment you catch a glimpse of a smile and then laughter and your heart is overwhelmed by a feeling you are not able to fully comprehend but somehow know is lost to you forever and you weep for the loss of it.

* It is about food. Hunger. Consumption.

* The inanimate objects of this world move from phase to phase, solid, liquid, gas.

* A kindness done, perhaps yesterday, perhaps a million years ago, but the memory was there.

* It does not know what it will find on the other side of the nebula, nor how long it will take to get there, but it does know, somehow it knows, that it will be home.

* It does not know what it will find on the other side of the nebula, nor does it know how long it will take to get there, but it does know, somehow it knows, that it will be home.

* It does not know what it will find on the other side of the nebula, nor does it know how long it will take to get there, perhaps it will take a million years -- and yet it does know, somehow it does know, that the place it is going to will be home.

* A danger, being chased by a predator of some kind.

* Hunger should be the motivating thrust of the story leading up to daylight.

* The creature which hunts him he slaughters and feasts upon, a living fungus.

* Do not

* The voice could be ignored. You could ignore it. And you consider what will happen if you do. Before you ate and nothing happened. It could be the same.

Finds a key under a clay vase

All the muscle, bone, sinew, and vicera of her body spiraled inward on itself, as if she were caught in the gravitational vortex of a black hole.



* (Dream) Sees her try to light the journal on fire, put it out, then hide it instead.

* Has a dream he visits the house and discovers a journal when her hung body with tentacles for a face point at the dresser. He wakes up, unaware he was dreaming. It’s the middle of the night. The house is the same as his dream. He finds the journal.

* The place looks like his dream, except reverse. And darker. He uses phone as flashlight.

* Exploring the house he sees his reflection in the mirror and is startled.

* Once the idea was planted within his brain it would not leave him alone. It seemed wrong and inwardly he even asked himself, can a person do things like this? Somewhere inside he knew he wanted his inner voice to reassure him. Don't be silly, of course not. There are laws prohibiting such things. But that voice never came and he knew that as long as no one found out, a person could do things like this. And worse things, if need be.

* While exploring the house, Will sees an old doll on the bed next to the pillow, maybe it startles him.
