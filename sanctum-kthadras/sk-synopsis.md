## SANCTUM KTHADRAS - Synopsis


_Remember therefore from whence thou art fallen, and repent_


### Part One. The Man Who Lives in the Room


#### Chapter One - Will

It is Will's first day on a new job. He soon learns that the woman who previously held his position committed suicide. Her name was Abigail, or Abbie. The computer she used has been untouched since and he goes through the filesystem to learn more about her and to maybe even learn why she did it. In a calendar entry he finds her mentioning a journal and one night when he can't sleep he drives to her address, finds the door open, and decides to look around for it. In a closet he sees a vision of her hanging by a wire with tentacles coming out of her eyes and mouth and then a tentacled hand points at an old desk in the corner of the bedroom. He wakes up and realizes it was only a nightmare. It is the middle of the night and he decides to actually drive over there as he just did in his dream. Once there he discovers that strangely things look pretty much how they did in his dream. He finds her journal in a hidden cubby in the desk drawer and takes it home with him.


#### Chapter Two - Abigail

Her journal entries reveal that she has been told to write this journal by her psychiatrist to help cope with the loss of her mother from cancer. The entries show how distraught she is, her mother being her entire world. She was unmarried and had no children of her own. She describes a day where she went to work in a bad mood and exploded at a coworker and was told to take the rest of the day off. She drives around the city all that afternoon because being at home only reminds her of her mother. In the early evening she picks up a hitchhiker who says he needs a ride to the hospital. He goes by the name of Rabbit and is a black albino, wearing a strange egg-shaped pendant around his neck. It becomes clear to her that he is some kind of con man, but in her state of mind she doesn't care and humors him. He spins her some kind of yarn about his mother being in the hospital with terminal cancer and eventually asks her for some money to help fly in his sister who lives in Kansas. She stops at an ATM and gives him a few hundred dollars. He thanks her and asks her instead to just drop him off at the McDonald's down on Ponce De Leon. 

She lets him out in the parking lot and pulls around to get a large order of fries, all the time watching him. First he goes inside and eventually comes out with a bag of food, but then hikes off into the woods behind the McDonald's. Still feeling a little out of her mind she gets out of the car and follows behind him. There is a rough path that leads into the woods. It is getting dark and the light very dim. It is humid out and she starts sweating, small gnats landing on her face and arms. Eventually she comes out behind the Kroger on Ponce De Leon, the one people call, the Murder Kroger. She sees him enter a door in the back and hesitating only a little decides to follow him through the door.

Inside she finds herself in a nondescript room, neither big nor small, with bare, smooth walls. Standing in the middle of the room is an old man in threadbare clothes. He greets her with a nod and the first thing out of his mouth is a question.

_Where are you hurting, Abigail?_

She asks how he knows her name and it turns out he knows more than that. He seems to know everything about her. For some reason she can't explain she trusts him and eventually breaks down and he consoles her with a hug. She leaves and returns through the woods to her car and goes home. The next day she is surprised to realize she no longer feels depressed. There is a lightness in her heart that she has not felt since before her mother died.


#### Chapter Three - Will

Will is captivated by this story and visits the Murder Kroger, but when he walks around back he can't find any door matching her description. He sneaks inside the back of the Kroger and sees a black albino sitting in the break room talking with someone. His is wearing the egg-shaped pendant around his neck. When he sees Will he gets up and walks outside into the parking lot to a piece of junk Corolla with a wire for a door handle. Will follows him and asks if he ever met a woman named Abigail who gave him a ride and a few hundred dollars. He says no and takes off in a hurry.


#### Chapter Four - Abigail

Returning to the journal, Will learns that after the meeting with the man in the room she continued to be happy for a few days, but then something happened. She becomes numb and insatiably hungry. She visits all you can eat buffets and eats until she vomits in the toilet. And then goes somewhere else. She starts drinking, not to feel numb but to stop the feeling of numbness. Then another few days go by and she becomes depressed again. But the numb feeling does not go away. She decides to revisit the man who lives in the room but just like Will she can't find the door when she walks around back. Confused and frustrated she remembers something the man had said to her when she asked where she was. "In a certain place, in a certain time, in a certain orientation." At the time he she thought he was being sarcastic, but now that she reflected on his words she started to wonder if he had been telling her the truth. His words reminded her of books she had read which explained multi-dimensional theory. She thought maybe it was not only important where she looked for the door, but also when and from what direction. So she waits until late afternoon, when the sun has just reached the top of the treeline and walks the same path behind the McDonald's. Sure enough she finds the door. The man is happy to see her and once again asks,

_Where are you hurting, Abigail?_

She tells him all about how she felt better after talking with him and then about the numbness that made her insatiably hungry. He once again embraces her and she departs.


#### Chapter Five - Will

Following what she discovered he too goes to the McDonald's and finds the path leading to the Murder Kroger. By the time he makes it through it is twilight and hard to make out the details of things. But he does see the door. He walks up to it and turns the knob, but it is locked. At that point he hears someone else coming through the woods and hides behind the trash bin. He sees Rabbit emerge and approach the door. Rabbit takes the pendant from around his neck, inserts it into a slot in the door, mutters something aloud, and turns the knob and enters. After a few moments of quiet Will approaches the door again because he can see the pendant and chain still hanging from the slot. Once again he turns the knob, but it won't open. He removes the pendant and looks at it. Suddenly he is hit over the head by something hard. He has just enough time to see Rabbit swinging a 2x4 in his direction, hitting him squarely on the shoulder. He is shouting, 'Gimme dat key back! Gimme dat key!" Will falls down and scrambles away into the woods. He sees Rabbit following close behind, and the flashing of a large blade in his hand.

Will loses his way in the darkening woods but eventually he no longer hears Rabbit behind him and he stops to rest. His breathing is hard and it is almost entirely dark. He is too nervous to use his phone flashlight since it might give his location away. He makes his way slowly through the woods, following the path by wherever there is the least amount of brush. He soon hits a wall and reaches out and feels that it is cold and leathery, like the skin of a lizard. The wall heaves and knocks him to the ground. He then sees a large black orb, glistening, watching him. Without being able to explain why he understands this is a creature that has not walked the Earth for millions of years. But he is also not afraid. He stares into its eye and sees the starry night sky reflected in its blackness. In the reflection he makes out a large, blue nebula with wide arms and turns to look at the real thing. It is mesmerizing. Hearing the large creature stir he gets up and goes back the way he came through the woods, eventually seeing the light of the golden arches through the trees.

In the days that follow, he uses a photo of the pendant to do an image search online and discovers it's an ancient symbol for the Order of Kthadras, the One Who Waits. Kthadras, he learns, is an Outer God whose followers believe resides in the core of the planet Earth. According to their belief, The planet Earth itself formed around the sleeping abomination billions of years ago as it waited for the return of something entirely unknown to us. Adherents believe their only role in life is to offer sustenance to the hibernating God. Orders are known to congregate around places where it is believed Kthadras has broken through the shell of the world (hence the egg metaphor) and therefore caused the surrounding landscape to wither and grow barren. This ground is sacred to them because it is a physical manifestation of Kthadras in the everyday world.

He emails a professor named Susan Burrows who has written the most on the history of the Order. He sends her the photo of the pendant and asks if she has ever seen anything like it and can help him understand the strange things he's seen. She writes back very quickly, wanting to discuss the pendant. They Skype briefly and it turns out she will be in the city in a few weeks time on a lecture tour and they make tentative arrangements to meet then. She warns him to not show anyone else the pendant until they talk.


#### Chapter Six - Abigail

In the meantime he reads more of the journal. After visiting the man she once more feels light in her heart, and can sleep well. But then after a few days she becomes insatiable again, gorging herself at buffets, but now she has also taken up drinking. Anything to help that numb feeling go away. And it does help. But it starts to affect her work. She misses some days. A friend hooks her up with a guy who sells marijuana and she does that. But it's not enough. She asks the guy to sell her meth after doing research on it. The guy says he doesn't fuck with that stuff but tells her about another guy he knows. She contacts him and they meet in a sketchy neighborhood where unaccompanied kids are playing in the street. He shows her how to do it and they get high. While high the dealer pressures her into pleasuring him, and she does. Then leaves. The meth works for awhile but she soon feels that numbness again. She also has a hard time remembering things about her mother, other loved ones from her past. And this frightens her. She returns once more to the man who lives in the room. This time she notices a difference. The walls of the room are now spotted in mildew. The man himself is paler than before. He speaks in a weaker voice, though still smiling.

_Where are you hurting, Abigail?_


#### Chapter Seven - Will

Will takes off work and attends Dr. Burrows' lecture. The lecture takes place in a renovated industrial complex that has been subdivided into studio workshops for craftspeople: blacksmiths, woodworkers, sculptors, stained-glass makers. There is a meeting hall in the center and the sign on the door reads, 'The Outsider Occult: An Introduction to Lesser-Known Belief Systems in the United States, and Beyond...' and the names of several people, Burrows one name among them. He attends her lecture and learns a great deal more than he was able to learn on the Internet. Dr. Burrows takes questions and then they sit down for coffee in a little cafe near the meeting hall.

He asks her if there is anymore information about the actual places, like how to gain access into the religious buildings. She mentions an anonymous contact who wrote her and offered to sell her the handbook the Order uses for it's gatherings. She didn't feel good about it, and didn't have the $5000 the person was asking, but she does have the contact email. She agrees to send him the contact information, but the main theme of their discussion is her trying to make him understand just how serious this is, and that if he has any concerns he should take what he's learned to the police. He tells her he believes they may have been involved or even responsible for Abigail's suicide. He describes the weird things he's seen, how you have to find the entrance that Abigail described, how he thinks maybe they're using some kind of hypnosis on him too. She re-iterates that he should not get any further involved. No matter how true or false their belief system, the order itself is real and therefore potentially dangerous. She tells him he only has the pendant because they want him to have it, for some reason that may become clear later. He laughs at that, incredulous.

"What I mean is, you email me out of the blue and tell me this bizarre story of a woman’s death, you tell me you're investigating for clues like you're fucking Sherlock Holmes. You see what I mean? But that’s not what’s really going on here. It’s as clear as day, you just haven’t recognized it yet. You still think you’re nothing more than a concerned citizen, an impartial but curious observer to the tragedy and potential crime you’ve uncovered. You still think you can close that journal anytime you like, make an anonymous call to the police, and then go on with your life, just like it was before. But you are a part of this story now. A role has been written for you and you are playing it at this very moment, by reading the journal, by taking that pendant, by coming to speak with me. Can't you see that? To put it more bluntly, because I can see by your reaction that you’re not seeing it — you still think you’re safe."

Then she reached out and grabbed his hand and squeezed it hard, as you would to wake up someone from a deep dream.

"You are not safe."

Will visits a bar that night, debates with himself whether he should keep going by contacting the email Dr. Burrows gave to him or by making an anonymous tip to the police and walking away. He decides to write a message and send it as an anonymous tip to the police, explaining they should investigate the path behind the McDonald's that leads to a room where a murder may have taken place. But they have to go in the early evening, before dark. Reading his message he looked crazy. But he buys a burner phone so it can't be traced back to him and texts the anonymous police phone number. Then he drives to the McDonald's and waits in the parking lot. In the early evening a patrol car pulls up and two officers get out and enter the path behind. An hour later they emerge, get in the car, and drive away. It's then he gets frustrated and emails the contact he was given, offering $5000 for the handbook.


#### Chapter Eight - Abigail

Weeks have passed. Abigail is regularly indulging in drugs, meth, cocaine, heroin, anything she can get her hands on. She is thinner. Her coworkers are concerned about her health and she has been asked to take some time off. At night she posts on personal ads to meetup with men and women for random sex. The numbness has given way to an emptiness. She spends so much money on drugs she is living on credit. She begins to charge money for the sex, agrees to meet up with groups of men, who abuse her. She feels compelled to do this because it alleviates the feeling temporarily. She returns to previous journal entries and cannot remember writing them. Her mother is a memory she has, like a nice shoe I once owned, fond but meaningless to me. One man she meets up with tells her there are men who would pay good money for rough stuff. Is she interested? Yes. One night she is gang-raped and beaten to a pulp. She enjoys the pain but it doesn't last. So once again she walks to visit the man who lives in the room. Now the room is blackened with a crimson mold of some kind, the floor has a fuzzy type of growth, and the man is clearly ill, his hair now fallen out. There are small crawling things in the corners though she cannot make them out. Still, after wheezing, he smiles at her,

_Where are you hurting, Abigail?_


#### Chapter Nine - Will

He is contacted by secure email and told to meet in a small town a few states up in an abandoned state hospital, dilapidated and overgrown. He is sent GPS coordinates from which to enter the building and given a time to be there. He is told to make sure he arrives at the exact time and to enter from the exact coordinates. He takes off work for the weekend, packs a bag, withdraws the five thousand in cash and heads out. He also brings an aluminum baseball bat.

By the time he pulls into the parking lot of the old place the sun is going down. He uses his phone to find the exact coordinates. With him he brings a small backpack with the $5000 inside and the baseball bat. As he enters the place he notices the light is strangely radiant and hallucinates creatures in the corners but when he gets closer there is nothing there. Strangely his mood is not afraid but euphoric. One of the shadows ends up being a man, brandishing a long knife. He is chased through the surreal environment, room to room, each one more bizarre than the last. Then he is caught by surprise, attacked and is stabbed, bleeding out. Then as a desperate last move he hurls a broken piece of concrete towards the man. It misses but breaks out a large window (opaque with layers of dust and grime) and a burst of sunlight comes through. Suddenly he is the one holding the knife and a black albino is on the floor, bleeding out, but still gripping an aluminum bat. "Don't kill me man. Don't kill me." The man pleads. Will looks with horror at the knife and drops it. He stumbles out of the place and returns to his car, bewildered. Only then does he look in a satchel he is carrying - the book is inside.


#### Chapter Ten - Abigail 

Abigail explains that she feels compelled to write in the journal so as to not lose the final connection to the person she used to be. It is hard for her to read the entries at the beginning of the journal. It feels like they were written by someone else. Her work stopped her paychecks and she is staying with a pimp in a weekly-rate motel, doing tricks for meth, robbing the johns. She spends her days watching out the window. There is a pregnant woman who lives across the lot and she watches her with envy, as something she can never be again. She is routinely raped and beaten but finds that she likes it because it is the only time she can feel anything like a human being. She is with a john who likes being choked. She keeps choking and choking and something inside her makes her keep going. She kills him and is euphoric about the feeling it gives her. But soon after is overcome with a feeling of overwhelming doom, as if her soul has been torn open and poured with acid. She returns once more to the man who lives in the room. Now the room is completed covered in some alien-textured mold and the ground is covered with creeping things. The man seems to have fused to the floor. His arms have turned into flailing tentacles. His teeth fallen out, hair gone. His skin has turned translucent like a newborn frog. He reaches out to her and with difficulty he asks the same question:

_Where are you hurting, Abigail?_


#### Chapter Eleven - Will

Once home he opens the book and starts to read. The book seems as if was written a thousand years ago, the language and syntax is strange and metaphoric, something like an Eastern religious text. He is not able to understand a lot of it, but reads a short parable and then flips through and sees hieroglyphic-like drawings of religious rites. One drawing in particular catches his eye showing two figures enclosed within a two-dimensional square, each hand is reaching out towards the other. There are rays of light emitting from the head of one figure. Below the square are dozens of crudely-drawn tentacles reaching upward, not unlike flames, and that is all enclosed within a two-dimensional egg. He studies the book well into the night and just as he starts to nod off his vision blurs on the page and he recognizes words forming in the negative space between the text. The characters are English but the words they form are not. Once he focuses on the words they disappear so he does his best to stay in that half-dreaming state and remembers what he can. The next morning he awakes from terrible dreams, his head resting on the book. On a sheet of paper beside him he has scrawled a strange phrase:

_Lyg'raob mar Plmuzar Okaxcib deve K'thadras piy gwam_

That this phrase contains the word 'Kthadras' seems too much to be a coincidence and so Will is convinced this is the phrase of passage he was originally told the book contained.


#### Chapter Twelve - Abigail

Abigail is not doing well. No matter how many drugs she does or how abused she is, the overwhelming feeling of emptiness and doom is ever-present now. She spends her days staring out the window of the weekly-rate hotel, drunk or stoned out of her mind, watching with envy the pregnant mother who stays in the room on the opposite side of the hotel lot, taking care of her kids.

She gets into a fight with her pimp and ends up killing him in a very violent way. Something breaks inside her and there is nothing left to hold back her feelings of rage. The anger fills the emptiness and she becomes euphoric. In a mindless frenzy she runs outside and murders the pregnant woman and does something to the unborn baby too horrible to mention.

Covered in blood she returns to the man in the room one last time. Along the way she picks up a railroad spike she finds in the woods, near the train tracks.

By now the room is completely overgrown with alien flesh. The entire place seems alive, crawling with strange lifeforms that have the characteristics of both animal and plant. Affixed to the floor is the man, or what remains of him. There is a small beak inside the tangle of tentacles where his face used to be. It hisses those words she had heard so many times before, yet before it can complete the thought she stabs it repeatedly through the head with the railroad spike. It makes a horrible sound and then dies. She leaves and returns to her mother's house.

She warns anyone reading the journal to not go near the room.

_Stay away. Maybe that is why I've kept writing all this time, to be a warning to others who might stumble upon it sometime in the future. What a joke my life turned out to be. Haha. I never understood this fucked up world and now I guess I never will._

Near the bottom of the final page a new paragraph had been started, consisting of a single word.

_Mama_


#### Chapter Thirteen - Will

With the pendant and book, Will makes his way through the woods behind the McDonald's to the back of the Murder Kroger. Using the pendant as a key and uttering the strange phrase, the door unlocks. He enters and finds himself in a long candlelit corridor which he realizes is lined with worshippers overlooking him from a floor above. They are chanting in low voices, their faces obscured under hoods. He walks through the corridor and descends the stairs at the end. The walls soon turn to rough-hewn stone like he is underground. Eventually he comes to an open room with three doors. He approaches the doors one by one and opens them. Through the first he sees the creation of the world, of the hibernating God Kthadras in the vastness of space, a time before the Earth was born, and instantly his hair turns white like snow and his mind is overcome. He understands the being which they call Kthadras in reality has no name. And never could. He opens the second and sees the familiar back area of the Murder Kroger, empty, a soft wind blowing through it. He closes the door and reaches to open the third, but it is locked. And would always be.

He turns and the stairs are gone. He sits in the room and tries to figure a way out. _I wait because it waits._ After several hours he heard one of the doorknobs turn. A woman entered, alone and looking somewhat pensive. At last he understood and accepted his role of honor. He rose to his feet and faced her, smiling.

_Where are you hurting, Abigail?_



### Part Two. The Fetus


You are used to the darkness by now, finding your way in the darkness, without the use of your eyes.
