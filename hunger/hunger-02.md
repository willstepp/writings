HUNGER

When I was a boy this is what the old men told me they had heard when they were boys

  The house on the end was where they took those with fatal hunting injuries or for sicknesses that had no cure. The old woman parted the deerskin covering the narrow doorway and then stood aside, her head bowed. Mika entered alone.
  Yaholo, an apprentice of the medicine man, stood over a firepit in the center of the room. Smoke from the fire curled up through a hole in the roof and its flames flickered shadows across the clay-hardened ceiling and walls. In one hand he carried an eagle claw wrapped around a buckskin pouch of herbs. He shook the herbs into the fire, which sparked and hissed, as he chanted the words of the death ritual. He was a real piece of work, Yaholo was, and that's putting it kindly.
  His mother, a woman named Ama, stood in the corner furthest from the ceremony with both hands clasped against her chest, her eyes fearful and red with tears. When she saw her son her frown turned into a compassionate smile and her eyes went to the bed at the other end of the room. There his father lay. 
  Sakima, the revered medicine man of their village lay upon a meager bed. His eyes were fixed on a faraway place that no one else could see. He lay utterly still except for gasps for air which came at irregular intervals. At times his eyes rolled back in his head.
  No one had instructed the boy what to do or how he should act in this moment. He glanced at his mother for guidance but her eyes were fixed on him who he had been brought to see. He went to the bed and took his father’s hand.
  “Father,” the boy said, kneeling beside him. Tears welled in his eyes but he held them back to appear strong.
  The boy said nothing else, holding his hand, inwardly recoiling at the unnatural coldness of his touch. Such coldness in a room with embers burning hot. Feeling helpless, the boy went to a table near the wall and poured a cup of water from a jar. He brought the cup to his mouth and gently fed it to him, and when the first drops wet his lips he came around again. Sakima’s eyes opened. And then he recognized his son standing there. A tear rolled down the side of his cheek and he took the smaller hand of his son into his own, and squeezed weakly.
  “Mika,” the old man said, “Beautiful boy. Come and see.”
  He placed his head against his father’s chest and smelled the bitter, aromatic salve. He felt the heartbeat within, rapid and then slow, strong and then weak. The boy stayed that way for a long time. They did not speak. He knew his father only wanted to be close to him for a little while.
  Underneath the table along the wall the boy saw a chicken pecking for seeds amid the scraps under a table, oblivious to all else in the room. Pecking in the dirt while his father lay dying. The boy watched the chicken and grew angry at it. At those stupid black eyes watching all.
  Then Sakima whispered into his ear and everything he saw instantly dimmed and every sound, except for the words his father spoke, instantly grew silent. The act of speaking itself seemed to cause the old man pain and when he was finished he collapsed onto the bed and went unconscious. The boy rose and looked at his father, unsure if he had understood all that had been told to him. So strange his words were. 
  What did he tell his son? Who can say. Maybe we'll find out before the story is over. But then again maybe not. Don't ask me anything else about it. If I told you how it ends it would ruin it.
  The boy saw his mother in the corner, weepping into her hands, and went to console her. Yaholo approached the sick man and the monotone of his chants grew suddenly in volume. He pulled a baton from his medicine bag and shook it overhead. From the corner the mother and son watched. Sakima came to life once more and shook from the core of his body. He appeared to be in great pain and jerked from one side of the bed to the other with unnatural strength.
  Then the boy saw the chicken under the table pecking in the dirt and became enraged. He darted towards it with hands outstretched but it was too fast and he fell against the table and knocked the pitcher onto the ground, where it shattered and spilled water everywhere. At this noise his father screamed.
  Sakima awoke. He raised from the bed and growled obscenities at his apprentice, standing there with the baton. Tears came into his eyes as he continued to utter the ritual chant. Then the old man saw his son. His eyes saddened.
  “Do what I ask of you.”
  The old man collapsed onto the bed again and shouted in pain and a few minutes later grew silent, eyes rolled back in his head, much as he had been when the boy first entered the house.
  He looked at his unconscious father and then at the chicken still pecking in the dirt and could take no more. He ran outside into the fog, unsure where he was going. He ran for a long time and groped in the dark for anything familiar. At last he stopped. He was standing before the tree rooted in the ceremonial grounds. 
  The branches of the tree spiraled above the other foliage in the valley. The tree was not from their time, but from another, more ancient world. It had been forgotten by the people of their village, except for Sakima who loved it. The boy had climbed on its limbs ever since he was able to and asked his father questions about it, what kind it was, how old, and when it was last alive. “Nobody knows,” his father had replied with tenderness, “It is a true mystery and therefore a gift to all who behold it.” The boy wondered at that and used to imagine the strange creatures which must have inhabited the earth when it lived and had perhaps been nourished by its leaves.
  Now it was the darkest time of night. The fog had dissipated and the stars were shining above. The moon was low and the morning was yet to come. He fell asleep curled in a nook of the trunk. He did not dream. Hours later, after his father had passed from this world, his mother found him there shivering and covered him up with a blanket.

  [Make this transition continuous, something like, 'Under the tree the boy slept until morning, when he was awoken...']
  "Get up."
  "Leave me alone."
  "But you have to."
  "Why do I have to?"
  "I don't know why. You just do."
  For seven days the village mourned. The worst of it for him was whenever he went outside and saw the green foliage of springtime, bright and lush, which seemed to him like an insult to the memory of his father. How at odds to the icy and withered landscapes he felt within. He hated every beautiful thing and spent those days crying or beating on his chest until it was bruised. He sat with his mother and her sister outside their home. The women expressed their sorrow with an endless chant of *Sakima* until they were out of breath. His nephews covered themselves in ashes and sliced their fingertips with tiny shards of flint. Neighbors wept inside their homes. All were forbidden to laugh or smile or even to speak a light word during this time. They fasted and drank only water.
  Days passed. Then it was over. The boy peered out of the window and saw people going back and forth, some his neighbors, carrying supplies and baskets of food. He was not required to prepare for the funeral rites which would be held that evening. Still he felt it would do him good to put himself to use. He joined them and headed to the ceremonial grounds.
  There a platform woven from reeds was being raised in the middle of the grounds. The boy set to work with the others, lashing together the platform with twine. If any noticed him as the son of Sakima they did not say so. They treated him like any other. The remainder of the day he helped with the preparations. By now the sun was going down and shined through the treetops. The boy was covered with dirt and his arms and back ached from the labor of the day. He sat and watched the women set up tables near the platform and then dishes of all kinds were brought out and arranged upon them. Roasted deer meat, pork, rabbit and other game were at the center. Then surrounding those steaming dishes were bowls filled with sour mashed hominy, locust-pod soup, honey, fried bean and corn bread, dried peaches, dried apples, and his favorite, kanuchi soup, which is made from hickory nuts.
  Families from the surrounding valley were starting to arrive, dressed in their best, most colorful clothes. He saw his own family arrive from the other side of the village, Ama and her sister Ayita with her husband and two boys. When his mother saw him she looked disapprovingly at his soiled clothes and dirty face and spit on her hand to wipe him clean.
  “Go prepare yourself.”
  By the time he returned it was evening. He walked among the crowds who were eating and drinking, laughing together and telling stories. The boy was not hungry himself and resented their carefree attitudes. He hid from his family, who sat on a bench near the base of the tree. He found a spot away from the crowds and crouched in the grass to watch them. He wanted to be left alone. His thoughts turned to the tree whose shadowed branches spiraled towards the muted skies of the evening. There it loomed over them all. Ignored but happy to be ignored. Just like him. Then he remembered what his father had asked of him. He had not thought of his words once since the night, but now it returned to him.
  “I will never forget again, from this day forward.”
  He thought to share those words with others would be a good thing. Perhaps tonight. To share them would be good.
  At last the elders emerged from the council house and descended into the ceremonial grounds. There were five of them in total and they were dressed magnificent. They wore most delicate deerskin robes woven in beads and feathers. Their faces were painted white. Kulsathee, the chief of peace, led them with a solemn frown. When they reached the benches at the foot of the tree they turned to face the people gathered. But their gaze was fixed on the two men who approached the funeral platform with the body of the departed medicine man.
  When the boy saw the body of Sakima, who had been anointed with oils and covered in dark paint, then dressed in a ritual gown, nothing like what he normally wore, he wept. The bearers reached the platform and lifted the body onto it. A young man brought tinder close to the pyramid of kindling and fuel wood and used a block of flint to start the fire. It caught quickly and within minutes the platform was engulfed, the bright orange glow shone onto the faces of those who had loved him most.
  So brightly it burned that Mika was no longer hidden in the darkness. He watched the flames consume his father. Plumes of dark smoke and flecks of embered ash rose into the air. He turned to the people and among them he saw a pair of eyes staring back at him. It was his friend Tye, a hunter like himself, and therefore trained to see things that wanted to remain out of sight. Tye was savvy. Mika knew he would respect his wishes and not approach him. Instead, Tye made a gesture by interlocking his two forefingers like a chain. This was a secret  symbol of their friendship. The boy returned the gesture.
  But someone else had found him in the flame light of the pyre, and approached from the side to not be detected. She emerged carrying food. The light reflected in her eyes and her long, braided hair shimmered, smooth and flowing like a dark river. Leoti was beautiful indeed. She placed a bowl of kanuchi on the ground in front of him and demurred in respectful silence. He gazed upon her and then at the bowl, the steam rising from it in the cooling air.
  “Eat, Mika.”
  “I’m not hungry.”
  Yet he knew it was not a request and she would not leave him alone until he ate, so he picked up the bowl and drank the soup down in gulps. It was good, rich and sweet. She then placed a wrapped cloth full of bread and roasted deer meat next to the bowl. Steam rose from within and grease seeped through the cloth.
  “Eat.”
  He ate the bread and meat and invited her to sit next to him. She did. The meat was good. The bread too. He had not realized how hungry he was. They sat together while the fire burned. He was happy she was here. He looked at the people gathered and saw them differently than before. He saw the love that had brought them together and that it was not something to take for granted. He no longer wanted to be alone and took Leoti by the hand and led them to the benches where his family sat. Ama received them with tenderness.
  As the evening went on people came by to pay respects. When it was very late and the fire had burned low the people who remained came closer and they each took turns telling stories about the old medicine man. Each story surprised the boy because it was like they were talking about someone other than his father. 
  At last Kulsathee rose in the circle of elders. He was a large, rotund man with long graying hair. He was the chief of peace and had been the leader of their tribe ever since before the boy was born. There were deep lines in his face and whenever he smiled the lines grew deeper still, like bunched up leather. His eyes were red and cheeks were wet from many tears.
  “All the old things are gone now and the people are different.  When we were boys Sakima and I roamed these forests and hunted together. Even then he was drawn to the mysteries of nature. He would commune with the spirit of the trees to reveal where the rabbits were hidden. We caught so many! It is true I loved Sakima, whom you all knew, from the time we were both boys and had our whole lives ahead of us. He was my good friend and I will miss him.”
  In the lull the boy felt moved to speak. He rose and approached the center of the circle, near the remnants of the pyre, whose embers still glowed dull orange and radiated heat as ripples in the air above. Nobody said anything when they saw Mika. The chief went to him and took hold of both his arms in the gesture of great kinship, and then returned to his seat with the other elders. Moments passed. The boy looked into the crowd and saw their hopeful and expectant faces. He knew they wanted to hear something about his father. Something fond and hopeful. But no words came. After a few minutes the people stirred. They grew restless and impatient. Some in the crowd put it down to youthful shyness. Some took it as disrespect. Some pitied the boy while others said he was not the man his father was.

  It was the season of abundance. The forests and meadows blossomed with a myriad of wildflowers and berries. The river which ran near the village, and provided irrigation to their crops, glimmered the afternoon sunlight. Women went daily to its banks and pulled fish from traps. These fish they roasted that same evening, there being no need to salt them for storage. Men hunted game in the nearby woods or did carpentry work that had been put off during the winter. They fixed leaky roofs and built summer shelters for the elders, which allowed the breeze to blow through. The younger children played hide and seek in the village and surrounding wilds. They went shirtless and ate blackberries until their fingers and mouths were stained purple. The older children gathered in the wide open space on the southern edge of the village grounds. Here a field had been cleared of all grass and shrubs so that only a hardened clay surface remained. Here children played dice and other ball games. Stick ball was popular, but the game that required the most skill was tchungkee.
  This was a game for hunters since it required the use of a flat-tipped spear. A small, stone disc the size of a grapefruit was rolled into the center of a demarcated arena. The hunters stood at the edge and threw their spears where they thought the disc would end up, based on its often unpredictable path. Points were distributed by whose spear landed nearest the disc. Tchungkee was so popular that many elders, who were no longer required to farm or hunt during the day, set up ramadas on the edge of the field and smoked tobacco while placing bets on the games.
  For many seasons now the best player in the village was Mika. This was well known and there was even a rule put in place by the gamblers so one could not bet on him more than four times in one day. Yet, ever since his the passing of his father, Mika’s game had fallen off considerably. He was no longer the sure bet he used to be, and both the elders and certain children were beginning to take advantage of that.
  Mohe, an athletic but somewhat dim boy, had challenged him to a game earlier that morning. Mika had not felt like playing today, but when he saw the expectant faces of the elders at the other end he rose from the sidelines, where he sat with Tye, and took up his spear.
  “I promise to go easy,” Mohe taunted him. He twirled his spear upright and deftly threw it at a practice target a little ways from them.
  Mika ignored his rival and ran his hands along the grain of his spear, then walked to the arena. The disc tosser got in position and gave the ready signal with a wave of his hand. They lined up on the markers at the edge. From here the boy could see the northern mountains, their ridges hovering faintly blue over the treeline of the forest. This was the only place in the village from which you could see them.
  The tosser pitched the disc into the arena. Being distracted the boy was slow off the mark and missed the timing of his throw. His spear wavered clumsily in the air and landed at an odd angle, barely sticking into the ground. This was his worst performance yet and he knew it even before they took measurements. It had landed a few feet away. Embarrasingly far.
  His rival ran onto the arena where his spear stuck mere inches from the disc and gloated over it. When the points were counted up he had won by a total of four points, three notches to the boy’s seven. Mohe was thrilled and ran to and fro, shouting to the other children that he had defeated the champion by a huge margin. The elders cheered Mohe from afar, as they had started placing their bets on anyone who opposed him, and they had won big.
  Truly he did not care. Mika sat down again on the sidelines and fixed his gaze on those faraway mountains. Tye approached and noticed where he was looking, but saw nothing of significance about them.
  “The old men say your spear must be bad for you to be throwing like this. They say, Tye give him your spear and he will win again. This we know.”
  “They don’t know anything, old buzzards,” the boy scoffed, “Let them stick to smoking their pipes and taking cat naps, for all I care”
  “It is all they have.”
  Tye scanned the field and saw Mohe now among a group of girls who sat in a circle underneath an oak tree sewing bead necklaces. They looked annoyed at him. Leoti was among them. It was obvious most of his attention was given to her.
  “Mohe has been flirting with Leoti. I have seen him do it before. What do you think about that?”
  “Let him. I don’t care what that frogeater does.”
  His friend dropped his own spear on the ground next to him.
  “Use my spear. Challege him again. I just want to see the look on his ugly face when he’s beaten square.”
  The boy looked up, puzzled.
  “My spear is good. See for yourself.”
  His friend picked up the spear and examined it. He felt the leather straps and ran his hand along the spine, looking for any imperfection, but found nothing.
  “No splinters, no warp. But how did you lose?”
  The boy once more looked to the mountains. His silence made Tye thoughtful. “Time will make things better,” he said, “You’ll see.” His brother had died in a hunting accident two summers ago and spoke from a place of wisdom. Then he rose and clasped one hand on Mika’s shoulder and stared him in the eyes.
  “You are the best of them, my friend. Do not forget it.”
  His friend departed in order to join a game of dice that had just begun on the other side of the field. As he went he brandished his own spear overhead and shouted back over his shoulder.
  “Or maybe second best!”
  Mika laughed and waved his friend away. A few moments later his eyes went back to the mountains. He looked at them for a long time. Much later he rose and went to find his mother.
  Ama sat outside with a group of young girls, teaching them how to flesh deer hides for the tanning process. When she scraped the broad, flint blade down the hide draped over the wooden incline her shoulder muscles rippled. She moved like a woman twenty years younger than she was. When the girls took their clumsy turns at the hide it merely served to show how adept the old woman was at her work. But she was patient and kind and therefore was a good teacher to them.
  When she saw her son approach she wiped her hands on her apron and embraced him. It was obvious from the way he appeared, head down and thoughtful, that something was the matter.
  “Let us walk,” she said.
  Ama told the girls to finish the hide they were working on and then take a break.
  “May we go for a swim?”
  “You may."
  The children cheered and happily resumed their task. Ama and her son walked together along the path that led outside the village gates. The doors were opened this time of year and from here they could hear echoes of the games in the arena, playful shouting and joyful laughter.
  “Why are you not with your friends?”
  “I was,” the boy began, “but I lost a game to Mohe. The elders no longer bet on the strength of my spear.”
  “Is that why you are sad?”
  He said nothing, but looked at her.
  “Of course it isn’t,” Ama observed. She pushed back his hair over his ears, “Now tell me what troubles you.”
  “Father asked something of me the night he passed away. To do what he said I must leave the village and journey north. Ever since that night his words are always with me. But I am not ready to go. I tell myself there is no rush. It can wait. There will be time to honor your father at a later time. But now when I walk with Leoti, his words are there. When I go for a swim in the river with my friends, his words are there. When I play tchungkee, his words are there. I can no longer enjoy the things I used to enjoy. It pulls me away from them. I do not want it. I want things to be like they were before.”
  The boy looked more lost than ever. His mother looked at him with compassion.
  “Sometimes in life we are given two paths to walk. One goes this way and one goes that way. Like the one which goes around our village. You see it there?”
  She pointed to the path which split at the gates and ran in both directions along the inside walls of the village, coming together at the other side.
  “It is okay to walk the path that takes you away from your friends, certain in the knowledge that eventually you will come around again to find your friends waiting for your return. The paths make a circle, like all of life, and this is how we keep the balance.”
  He dried his eyes. He smiled.
  “Is it really true?”
  “I believe so.”
  They embraced and then returned inside the gates. The late afternoon sun shone through the cracks in the palisades and lit geometric patterns on the grass where they walked. It was dinner time and in the air was an aroma of barbecued fish and cornbread baking on the fire.
  
  Mika woke before dawn. He rose quietly from his bed so not to wake his mother, who was asleep in the next room. In the dim light he found his knife and sheath, and slung the traveling satchel over his shoulder. Inside the pouch was the food his mother had prepared the night before, many slabs of fresh deer pemmican. There was no real need to carry water as he would be following the river and could drink from it whenever thirsty. He also brought flint for lighting fires. Outside their home was a small shed his father had used for the storage of personal farming equipment and hunting gear. he rattled through the contents of the shed as quietly as he could until his hands landed on the old bucket they used when irrigating their own crops. Because they had not grown their own vegetables in a few seasons the bucket was filled with debris. He emptied it onto the ground and took it with him.
  With these few items the boy stepped onto he path that headed outside the northern gates. He followed the torchlight and looked up at the dark blue of the morning skies beyond the black shapes of the trees. As he approached the gates he saw the morning lookout, a boy his own age named Gawoni, fast asleep underneath a platform built for archers. He went over to the boy and gave him a gentle kick in the shins.
  Gawoni startled out of his sleep, fists up. When he saw Mika he stretched both arms overhead and yawned like a mountain lion. 
  “I was awake the whole time. Don’t tell, okay?”
  “Don’t tell you were awake?”
  Gawoni shrugged. Again he demanded the lookout to open the gates.
  “Where are you going this early in the morning?”
  “To fulfill an obligation.”
  “But where?”
  “North, to the mountains.”
  “Why go there?”
  Mika did not answer.
  “The mountains are very far from here. Too far to travel on foot. How long will you be gone?”
  “However long it takes.”
  “What road will you travel?”
  “The river will guide me there. Its source is in those mountains, so have I been told.”
  “You intend to follow the river and not the road?”
  “The road does not go to the mountains.”
  Gawoni considered this and finally said,
  “You are a strange one, Mika. And brave. Don’t you know where the river north will lead you?”
  Then the boy remembered and went suddenly cold. The northern route cut straight through the a gorge that was forbidden among the tribe. This was a dangerous place in the hills, permanently bathed in a muted dusklight. The ravine there cut a deep gash in the surrounding hills and dense, ancient oaks on the ridge blocked out any sunlight. Yet it was not the unnatural darkness that made the gorge forbidden. It was also home to a witch, or so the legend told.
 She was a malevolent witch who existed by feeding on the souls of the sick and dying, thereby extending her own life. She has the ability to go unseen or to take on the form of those who souls she has robbed. The only way to know of her presence is from the sound of her scream, like a multitude of ravens, whenever out hunting prey.
  The old men in the village told stories of hearing the Raven Mocker at the edge of the gorge when they were children. Then there were also stories of dead souls, those whose souls had been sucked out by the witch and from them on walked around with nothing inside them. Outward they looked normal but inward they were hollow and had no heart. Thus the gorge had been declared forbidden by the chief and elders, and ever since then no one from their village had dared to go there.
  Gawoni pushed open the large gate door just enough for the boy to leave. He picked up the bucket and pulled tight the strap of the satchel which hung at his side. Then he walked outside the gates and immediately heard the latch close behind him. From within he heard the lookout call to him.
  “Be safe on your journey, my friend.”
  It was just before sunrise and a pastel glow from behind the hills gave him light enough to find the river. When he got near it he heard the calms waters trickling over stones and fallen limbs, lapping up against the grassy banks. He cupped his hands into the water and drank. It was very cold. He followed the river all morning. At certain times he glanced back to see whether his village was yet out of sight. For some time it was there, until once he looked and it was gone.
  He followed the river for days, camping alongside it once the evening came, cooking slices of pemmican for dinner. The weather was fine, with clear skies and a gentle breeze. Because he was so tired the food always tasted good. For the same reason he slept hard and woke well-rested in the morning.
  One afternoon he came to a bend in the river. Beyond that he knew was the entrance to the gorge he had been warned about. He rested in the crook of a birch tree and when finished his lunch and set off towards the bend, feeling a sense of dread inside. At the bend he stopped and listened for anything out of the ordinary. He himself had never heard the shrieks of the witch, but he knew those who said they had. After a few minutes of waiting and hearing nothing but the sounds of the forest he continued on. 
  Here the slope of the hills became steeper and the light tapered off the further he went. Though he knew the sun was overhead the entire place shadowed like it was during an eclipse. It was an unreal, dreamlike view. Because of the incline the trees leaned over and covered the whole area. The water of the river became darkened and its sound echoed faintly on the inclines. The boy went further. The narrow banks grew narrower. There was not much room for him to walk. On his left the river and on his right the steep hillside rose, much too steep for him to navigate. And then he heard shrill bird-like shrieks echoing. Bouncing off the slopes of the ravine the noise came, to his ears full of rage and malintent. He stooped behind a fallen stump and shut his eyes. It was true, after all. The witch was real. The shrieks came again and it was just as described in the legends, a unearthly scream like a cacaphony of multitudinous birds.
  Now was the time when he had to decide whether to go on or turn back. To follow the river out of the valley he had to continue on this path. There was no way around the gorge that was known to him. To navigate around it could take weeks of walking. But to go on he would risk facing it. In his mind the image of the it grew, her wide spread of wings beating the wind and trailing behind her was a tail of flames.
  Later the shrieking stopped. How long he found it hard to tell. He rose from behind the stump and walked beside the banks of the river. At another bend, a mile or so from where he entered the gorge, the bottom widened and spread into a meadow of a kind, filled with rotted trees that had fallen from the high slopes. There were mushrooms growing out of many of them, of all shapes and colors. None he recognized at a distance. The grass was damp and the soil soft. His mocassins sunk in with each step, so he tread lightly. The air was cool, but there was a musty smell from the flora decomposing that made him reluctant to breathe it in. Then he saw it. Somehow he had reached it in the shadows unaware, until it was right in front of him.
  An enormous boulder, a fractured section of the ravine walls, set in the middle of the meadow. Upon its plateaus sat perched a horde of crows, hundreds of them.
  The boy peddled backwards but had no good place to hide. So he stood there. And he looked.
  The birds shrieked once more and at this close distance the sound pierced his eardrums and he covered them with both hands. Again the sound echoed off the high walls of the gorge and repeated in ever-diminishing volume. As his eyes adjusted to the strangeness of them he started to notice the individual birds. He saw their sharp, black beaks and the jerky way they moved back and forth. Covering the nooks they sat upon was ages upon ages of droppings, white and waxlike. They were birds.
  The boy stood and gave a wide berth as he walked by. He stepped lightly so not to startle them but there were leaves and twigs on the ground, crackling underfoot. All at once the entire horde ruffled their feathers and let out shrieks. He dropped to his knees and covered his ears. Then he felt a beating on the wind and looked and saw the crows had taken flight. Like a single organism they rose into the air and swirled above the river and flew up out of the ravine in graceful synchronicity.
  The boy got to his feet and listened but there was only the sound of the riverflow. He kept walking, keeping as close to the banks as he could. Several hours later he reached the edge of the gorge, where it opened into a wide clearing. There he stopped and made a fire and rested for the evening.
  
  Beyond the gorge he walked through open fields covered in tall grass and bushes. The trees grew sparse here. He was not used to such vistas and gazed up at the big skies in awe. The grass came up past his knees and the boy got satisfaction in the way it flattened underfoot. He had arrived at the verge of the prairie. Farther than he had ever been from home. 
  He decided to rest at the verge and set camp underneath some maple trees. The river had broadened, as if to mirror the landscape. Its waters became clear and he could make out pebbles and sediment along the bottom of it. The boy went for swims naked and dried out in the sun. When he was hungry he cooked pemmican over the fire or sometimes ate it raw.
  Daily he set out on the prairie. Each morning there were fewer and fewer trees and then one morning there were none. He found himself in the middle of a vast ocean of gentle knolls and pale green grass. There was a wind that never ceased. It blew from the west and rippled the grass of the plains like water. 
  Above the horizon he could see the hazy outline of the mountain range. At the beginning of each day the boy fixed his eyes upon it and went towards it. Yet when the evening came he appeared no closer and became dishearted. Soon he learned to fix his eyes on nearby landmarks instead, like the sloping hills or cottonwood trees on the banks of the river, and use them to measure his progress.
  He never thought about home. As he traveled through the plains the austerity of the empty landscape somehow entered into him. There was a silence in his heart he had not known before now. It was a kind of joy. It was as if his entire existence had become the act of placing one foot in front of the other, hour after hour, day after day. And nothing more. It was good. When he rested at sundown and cooked pemmican over the fire it was so that he had strength to go on tomorrow.
  One day the boy counted the provisions in his satchel and determined that at his current rate of progress he would run out of food before he even reached the foothills. It had not occurred to him just how far away they were, and how long it would take to get there. Another thing was the fact that seemed to be no wildlife to hunt. No game or fowl. No insects. And no edible vegetation, no fruits or nuts to gather. During his frequent swims he had seen fish in the river from time to time, and heard them splash in the twilight, when the sun was going down. So that gave him some hope. Because of all these things the boy cut back on his daily rations. He sliced the slabs of pemmican into quarters and allowed himself one morsel at every meal. It was not enough to keep him strong, but it kept him going until he could figure out what to do.
  The weather held. Blue skies most days and only the odd rainstorm. When it was bad he fashioned a lean-to from his bedroll and some twigs and nestled inside to keep dry. But most days the sun was bright and hot, and since there was no shade except for the occassional cottonwood tree he got blisters on his face and neck and forearms. The burn on his neck got so sore he would sometimes douse his shirt in the river and drape it over his shoulders for an afternoon, for some relief.
  The bucket also wore blisters on his palms. He regularly switched hands and tried to ignore it, but then the skin broke and started to bleed and it was a knife sticking into him. For this he wrapped the handle with a bunch of grassblades. It helped a little.
  His shoes fell apart. The stitching came loose and created holes where dirt or tiny pieces of grass could get in, irritating the skin. The boy had not prepared his footwear for such a journey. He ought to have reinforced them with more hardened leather, and cursed himself for not remembering. But it was too late now. As the shoes disintegrated they fit looser and wore blisters on his heels and the bottoms of his toes. At night, by campfire light, he soaked his feet in the river and washed the dried blood and dirt from them. That helped to ease the pain. Yet because the shoes were in such poor condition the cycle repeated the next day. Eventually he had to stop and rest every other day to allow his feet to heal before continuing on the path. This compounded the problem of his food running out. Finally, as a way to keep moving, he stripped his shirt into pieces and with some woven grass as line he wrapped the soles for padding.
  The lack of food along with the blisters and sunburns slowly wore the boy down. Evenings he lay under the stars unable to sleep and tried to ignore the sores, but it seemed no matter which way he turned some part of him was irritated. And because he got no good rest he was groggy in the daylight hours and became easily frustrated. He cursed at minor things, like the grassblades tickling his thighs or how cold the river water was. Once he lost his temper and flew into a rage, becoming red in the face and beating on the ground with his fists.
  He attempted to catch fish in the river to supplement the pemmican, but line to fish with was another thing he had not brought along. He fashioned a trap with the empty bucket. That did not work very well. Then he tried to make a line and lure with some woven grass but that too failed to catch any. He last tried to grab a fish barehanded, using the tickle technique, but they were too quick for him in his weakened state.
  “How weak you are,” the boy said aloud, “You are soft and weak. Out here is not for the weak, but for the strong. And you are not strong. You are pitiful!”
  The moon was obscured by high clouds which moved fast across the night sky. He lay there hurting and missed his home. He thought of his mother and his friends and all the people he loved in the village, and who loved him. Under the immensity of the night skies the boy felt his insignificance. And very alone.
  In the morning he ate breakfast, packed up the camp, and returned to the path. His back was to the mountains.
  It was a early afternoon when he rounded the final bend of the river and saw the familiar wooden palisades which protected his village. The gates were opened so he walked straight through. Everything was just as it had been when he left. Several villagers noticed the boy and their eyes widened.
  “Mika, where have you been?”
  “Doesn’t he look different?”
  “He does. Older somehow.”
  Yet he did not answer them. He went straight to the summer house he shared with his family this time of year. His mother sat under the shade of a ramada, boiling beans in a pot over a small fire pit. Ama looked up and gasped. She smiled, proudly.
  “You have returned! How thin you are!”
  She asked her son to come inside. He set the bucket against the house and followed her. After he cleaned himself, he put on fresh clothes and ate a meal she had prepared, roasted chicken with frybread, beans, and a bowl of macerated strawberries for dessert. He scarfed the food like an animal. His rations had run out as he entered the valley so it had been days since his last meal. Once he was finished he looked up and saw his mother staring at him. Her eyes were filled with pride. She said nothing about the journey and yet for the rest of the day he caught her beaming whenever she thought he wasn’t looking. 
  Because he was exhausted the boy went to sleep while it was daylight still. He crawled into his bed and pulled the skins over his head to block out the light and to hide his shame.

  It was early morning and a mist rose from the pond where he and Leoti walked, holding hands. They came to a log and sat down. A strider darted out of the grass close to their feet and glided across the surface, making no sound and yet leaving a wake of tiny ripples behind. Not many in the village were awake. That was part of the reason they liked to meet at this hour, because somehow it felt like everything in the forest belonged to them. Together they watched the sun come up between the trees on the hillside.
  After, Leoti went to wake her brothers and to prepare breakfast for her family. The boy went back home and did his chores. He scooped feed into a basket and went around back to the chicken pen. Inside was a bed of straw. One of the chickens lay on its side. The boy poked it and saw that it was dead. Its eyes were covered over by a milky film. Then he looked into the shed and saw that all of them were dead. There was no blood or any sign a fox had entered. On the hay he saw some kernals of corn. They were partially covered in a black fur, some kind of mold. He had never seen anything like it before. He ran his hand through the feed in the basket and saw some kernals covered in the same fur. He wiped his hand on the ground and looked towards the center of the village. There was some activity there. He headed there with the basket of contaminated feed.
  At the central storehouse a group of villagers had gathered. Each one brought with them baskets full of contaminated seed and some of them had even brought dead livestock, like chickens or piglets, which they held up by the legs, at a safe distance.
  Yonaguska was the keeper of the storehouse and he was woken and brought to them. He wandered up, rubbing the sleep from his eyes, and asked them, “What is so important to wake me this early?”
  When he saw the dead livestock and the contaminated grains his expression turned grave. He handed the cane he walked with to his son, who had come along with him and climbed up the small ladder to a platform where the entrance to the storehouse was. At the top he scraped his fingers along the edge of the hatch in order to break the clay sealing, and then set it against the wall. He lit the torch he carried in his belt and leaned forward to see inside. But he was unable to see very far. His son climbed up onto the platform and held the torch for him while he crawled through the tiny entrance. He was as small and wiry as a mouse, one of the reasons he had been given the responsibility, and disappared inside. His son held the torch at the door and there was stirring inside while everyone below awaited his discovery.
  When he emerged he climbed down and faced the crowd, which had doubled in number. He shook his head solemnly.
  “Most everything has been contaminated with the mold. Corn, beans. The potatoes look good. I don’t know how this happened. The seals are in place. It’s as dry as a desert inside.”
  “What do we do now? My pigs are all dead.”
  “And my chickens.”
  “My rabbits too.”
  “That I cannot say,” Yonaguska said, “We need to inform the elders so they can hold council.” He turned to his son.
  “Run fetch Kulsathee. Fetch them all. Be quick!”
  His son ran off towards the townhouse.
  Kulsathee and the elders arrived soon after and were shown the contaminated stores and the dead animals who had consumed the mold. The chief of peace immediately sent out a messenger, the lookout Gawoni, to tell those who lived within the village walls and also those who had homes in the surrounding hills, not to eat nor feed to livestock any of their provisions until further notice. He then asked to be shown the crops which no one else had thought to check.
  They walked as a group to the southern side of the village. There were large, squared-off fields, in rotation so that no soil was used more than twice in one year. Planted now was corn, squash, beans, pumpkins, potatoes, onions, and strawberries. There were women working the soil and they were asked to help inspect the vegetation. Row by row they crounched and picked through the leaves and stalks and held up specimens covered in the black fur. Again, all had been contaminated except for the potatoes. After that the elders went to the townhouse and held council for many hours.
  Gawoni returned later in the afternoon from the hills. He had reports from the families who lived there and from hunters who were in the forest. The mold had infected their food supply also.
  “The hunters told me they had found game, deer and rabbits, who had eaten of the infected vegetation and died. They dared not to dress out those. The families too. They ask what will they eat?”
  Kulsathee and the elders deliberated and decided it was safe to eat potatoes. But that was all. They sent Gawoni out to inform the people in the valley. Yaholo was asked to perform a ritual in order to cleanse the valley of the blight.
  The elders sent word to every one in the village to come to the ceremonial grounds and to bring their contaminated food supplies for burning. And that evening they came, the entire population, about two hundred. They carried skins full of corn, beans, onions. All contaminated. It was everything they had, except for potatoes. A bonfire was lit and all their food was thrown upon it, to be incinerated. As their food burned the smoke turned blue-black and rolled upwards beyond the limbs of the ancient tree and dissipated in the night skies.
  The boy had come with his mother. He threw all their food onto the flames and watched the corn kernals pop and char. The onions wrinkled up in the embers. On the other side of the grounds he saw Leoti with her family. He went to her. It was only this morning they had sat by the pond and watched the sun rise. They looked at one another and the mournful look in both their eyes expressed that understanding without words. They stood together and held hands and watched the fire with everyone.
  Soon Yaholo entered the ceremonial grounds dressed in an elaborate coyote headdress and furs. He carried the large green soapstone baton that had been passed down from Sakima. He fastened rattles to his forearms and calves and a small skin drum was hung around his neck. His face was painted all white. Everyone grew quiet when they saw the impressive and solemn entrance. Helpers dragged seasoned cedar logs behind them and when the medicine man gave the word they set them on the fire.
  A distinctive cedar smell filled the air. The helpers themselves had drums and started to beat on them. Yaholo joined them. The beat was at first slow but increased in rhythm. At certain times the medicine man would begin a recitation.

  Out, evil medicine! Leave our crops immediately!
  Out, evil medicine! Leave our stores immediately!
  Out, evil medicine! Leave our village immediately!
  
  Go back into the Darkness. Go back into the Heart of the World!
  Go back into the Darkness. Go back into the Heart of the World!
  Go back into the Darkness. Go back into the Heart of the World!

  The chanting of the ritual repeated seven times in total. On the final recitation his helpers joined in. The drums were beaten ferociously. Yaholo shook his arms and legs between the beat of the drums. Then in the silence immediately after he pulled four snake skins from his medicine bag which had been bound together. Then he removed a bag of herbs and sprinkled them onto the skins and tossed it into the flames. The villagers watched with fascination.

  Crops infected with the blight were gathered and burned. Dead animals discovered in the wilds were also burned. The villagers horded potatoes for their own families. Fights broke out when it came to distributing what remained of them from the town storage house, as some were left with little to eat. Since nobody knew what would happen next they rationed whatever potatoes they had. One family of six who lived outside the gates in the hills had no potatoes left at all, so the father went from house to house in the village asking for help. But none wanted to give up their only foodsource, especially in this uncertain time, though some did give begrudgingly.
  “Why should we help you when you never helped yourself? Pure laziness!”
  “You should have prepared like we did. Aren’t you ashamed to beg for food?”
  This is what his neighbors said.
  The father, a man named Salal, came to the door of their home one afternoon when the boy was repairing a hole in the roof. He climbed down and greeted the man, who would not look him directly in the eyes. He stared at the ground and held a small, empty sack at his side.
  “Do you have any potatoes to spare?”
  The boy went inside to fetch his mother. Ama came out a few minutes later, a small pile of potatoes in her apron. The boy stood behind and stared at the man, then at his mother. When she handed him the pile the man sobbed. His eyes were red and swollen.
  “Thank you, Ama. This will mean the world to me and my family. Truly you are the wife of Sakima!”
  The father collected the potatoes in a skin sack he dragged behind him and went on to the next house.
  The boy looked at his mother.
  “Why did you give him so many of our potatoes?” the boy asked. “We won’t have enough for ourselves.”
  Ama did not answer. She went back inside and after a few moments the boy climbed back onto the roof and resumed his work. He watched Salal beg at the next home and leave empty-handed.

  One night a scream came from the house of Ninovan. The boy rose from his bed and went outside to see what was the matter. Others had also come out and they all looked in the direction of the house. Not long after a woman came running down the path, carrying a young boy, her son. His skin was blue and there was no life in his opened eyes. She ran to the townhouse and cried at the door. Kulsathee exited and called for Yaholo.
  The medicine man said a few words of purification, but there was nothing to be done for the boy. Yaholo looked up with helpless eyes and turned to the mother. She fell to her knees and held the lifeless body of her son. She wept.
  It was revealed the boy had eaten potatoes earlier that day. The elders asked to see their supply and they were brought in a basket. They found traces of the black mold. There was panic.
  “What will we eat now?”
  “How am I going to feed my children?”
  “Why have the elders not come up with a plan?”
  Nobody slept that night from the fear that they or their loved ones might suffer the same fate as the house of Ninovan. 
  In the morning all were called to the ceremonial grounds. The elders had held council all through the night and would pass on their decision at this time.
  Under the tree the village gathered. Kulsathee led the elders out of the townhouse and down the steps into the grounds. They went to the log bench and sat down. The chief of peace alone rose and surveyed the faces of the people. His expression was solemn and when he began to speak the sound of his voice was like a large drum, definitive and booming.
  “You must know that a blight has come over our valley. It has affected our crops, our stores, and our livestock. It has contaminated plans in the wilds and therefore has also sickened or killed the game that roam our forests. We had thought that potatoes were safe, but only last night, as you all know by this point, a boy died from eating potatoes contaminated with the black mold. His name was Kanuna and his loss is a devastation, an inconsolable loss. Such a bright boy,”
  His voice broke off. He paused for a few moments and continued, his voice not so resolute as before.
  “We do not know the source of this blight. We do know that it acts like a mold and will spread on contact. It seems to spread through all varieties of plants, grains, vegetables, and fruits. Although the mold does not seem to spread via animals or people, it can still make you sick, as we have learned. The most at risk our the very old or the very young.”
  “But what can we do?” A young father shouted, “How can we feed our families now, when the potatoes are contaminated? You said they were safe to eat!”
  Some in the crowd scolded the man for showing disrespect, but Kulsathee calmed them with a wave of his hand.
  “Do not blame this man for his outburst. This good father has asked what all of you want to know. I understand this well. Do not forget that I am also a father, and a grandfather, and soon to be a great grandfather.”
  He gestured to his large family sat nearby. His granddaugther rubbed her belly and smiled bashfully. Kulsathee regarded them with compassionate eyes.
  “Do not be afraid. Myself and the elders have held council all through the night. Since this came to pass we have also held council with the farmers and hunters among you, in order to see what can be done.”
  “Every man who is able to hunt will tomorrow set off on a journey to the next valley. We have sent a scout there and he has reported back the blight has not yet spread that far. It is a five day journey. We will enter the next valley to hunt deer, rabbit, and other game. Accompanying the men will be a small group of women, to gather nuts, and wild fruits and vegetables that can be dried. They will also stay at the base camp to dress the kills and to salt them for the journey back to the village.”
  “Because the best place for the hunters will be in the next valley, they will remain there and we will set up a system of checkpoints to deliver the food supply. Then, after a couple of weeks, the hunters will return to rest and to see their families. Then we start over again. By doing this we will be able to store enough food to last throughout the winter, and safely into the following year. Remember, the days are now long and warm, but we cannot forget they will not always be so. We must not forget that the Earth is bountiful but she is also harsh. Our people are strong and by working together we will overcome the blight. We will not starve!”
  
  It was a warm day in summer. The hunters crouched in the grass nearby a creek where the deer came to drink. A soft breeze blew across the clearing and rustled the leaves on the trees. Tye lashed the decoy to his right and crawled flat on his stomach to the edge of the water. He lifted the mock deer head just above the grass line and bobbed it up and down in a realistic manner. Then Mika placed his hands over his mouth and whistled like a bird, their agreed upon signal to one another while tracking prey in the neighboring valley. Tye knew from the whistle the deer head was visible from afar and he should keep it at that height.
  Being the decoy fell on Tye because the boy had the truer aim. The elder hunters had decided upon this themselves during target practice. Tye did not resent that it was not his part to slay the deer when hunting with his friend. He knew someday his chance would come.
  As they waited the boy adjusted the tension on his bow strings and absent-mindedly rolled the arrows on the ground at his feet. Today was a good day to hunt. The sky was clear and blue. There had been thunderstorms the previous week, which had made it tougher to meet their weekly quota, but with hard work the hunters had still reached the goal. Things were going well.
  At the sound of rustling in the bushes near the creek the boy immediately refocused and notched an arrow into his bow and drew into position. His breathing became measured and calm. Soon there was more movement, the sounds of a twig snapping, and then a buck and doe appeared together at the edge of the creek. Slowly they drank from the cool waters and though the decoy was plainly visible to them, they did not seem to notice it. That was good. It gave the boy more time to choose the best shot.
  He raised up on his haunches so that his eyeline was level with the top of the grass. The two deer were not in the best position for a kill. The boy needed them to face east in order to expose their vulnerable side. Because they were so close by the boy could not risk moving even one inch from his spot. The deer were attuned to the sound of any predators, and that included him. Any sound at this point would give him away.
  After a few minutes of nothing his feet tingled from the lack of blood flow. His bow wavered slightly from its mark. Across the clearing he saw the head of the decoy lower and raise again in an unrealistic manner and hoped Tye had enough strength to hold steady.
  Then the deer ambled further down the creekside. And soon they were broadside to the boy. He let his arrow fly and it struck the buck just behind his foreleg with a thwomp. Both deer immediately sprung away without a break in stride, the arrow buried deep and blood letting out. In the same breath the boy prepared another shot. He wanted to get that doe before it was out of range. He drew an arrow and let it fly without hesitation, but it was a poor shot and went wide. But then Tye rose from his spot, in perfect position. He tossed the decoy from his arm and drew aim and let his arrow fly. He struck the doe mid-stride and it fell hard onto the ground at the forest edge.
  “Woohoo!”
  Mika stood and beamed at his friend. They collected their gear and went to place where the doe had fallen. Tye kneeled over his kill and said a prayer, asking for forgiveness and to thank her for gift she had bestowed upon them. Together they set to work and field dressed it. With knives they opened and gutted her and then stretched out the body upright against a small tree, so the blood could drain. Tye tossed the entrails into the grass.
  Then they tracked the blood trail which led them to the buck. An hour later they found him dead in some brush. They dressed him out on the spot and lashed him to a travois and headed back to pick up the doe, and then to camp.
  By now it was afternoon and they were hungry. They pulled some pemmican from their bags and ate near the creek, dipping their canteens into the water for drink. Because they had tracked all morning they were famished and the food tasted good and they could feel it replenish their energy. While they ate they talked about the hunt and their good fortune. With the doe and buck this would put them ahead of quota for the week and would please the elders.
  “I never saw somebody go from decoy to killshot with such speed,” the boy said, praising his friend.
  Tye downplayed the compliment but his pride was evident.
  “It took the both of us,” he countered, “Your shot at the buck set me up. All I had to do was aim and shoot.”
  The boy smirked.
  “All you had to do.”
  They both laughed, and finished their meal. After, they refilled the canteens and took hold of the travois and began the long and arduous path back to camp.
  It was twilight before they were in sight of the camp, the firelight and smoke visible in the distance. They were joined on the path by other groups of hunters returning. Once again it seemed they had the best luck of the day. Entering the camp they were greeting by a group of girls who were in the act of salting meat from the previous day. They giggled and pointed to the hunters, too shy to speak. Helpers came out when they reached the center of the camp. They unlashed the kills from the travois and hauled them off to start the processing.
  There was a large fire where the hunters gathered every evening to discuss the work of the day over roasted meat and vegetables that had been collected. Some laid on their backs resting. Others sat on logs napping arrowheads or sharpening their knives for the following day. All were in a cheerful mood.
  He and Tye were received like heroes, even among their peers. They fed themselves and sat around the fire with the others. Word had already got around about their kills. Tye stood and retold the story, exagerrating only in places. He described the decoy, the creek, where Mika was crouched in the grass, and from which direction the deer had come. They were all impressed.
  At some point three of the elder huntsmen emerged from their tent and came over to the congratulate them. They placed their hands on the boy’s shoulder.
  “Here he is, the boy with the bow. You have made us proud today!”
  “It was Tye also,” Mika said, “He killed the doe himself.”
  They beamed and nodded to Tye.
  “Well then, you have both made us proud, and one day you will be warriors. This we know.”
  They stood the hunters and took them around the arms and shook them in the gesture of great respect. Then they addressed the group and told everyone to get plenty of rest. Since they had met quota for the week, the following morning they would be returning to the village for a few days of rest. The hunters cheered and that night they slept well from exhaustion and dreamt not the of the hunt but of home and being reunited with their loved ones.

  The children ran out to meet the caravan. In their hands they carried wooden knives and tiny bows. When they saw the line of weary, yet proud, hunters they all shouted in unison, 
  “They have returned! Everyone come and see!” 
  Most of all they wanted to see Mika, the youngest and best of all the hunters. He was the one the children most looked up to (and secretly wanted to be). When they saw him and Tye heading up the back of the caravan line they scrambled in that direction and immediately asked questions.
  “How many did you kill this time?”
  “I bet fifty!”
  “No way, that’s too many.”
  “Then you haven’t seen Mika shoot.”
  The children were caught up in the excitement of the moment and shouted over each other. 
  “Mika, the boy with the bow!”
  Tye and he exchanged amused glances over their little heads and answered their questions they best they could.
  At the gates the families were gathered in a large crowd. The gates were opened and had been decorated with beautiful streams of woven flowers. The smell of flame-roasted game was in the air and lifted the noses of the weary hunters and their caravan. They embraced their loved ones and told them all that had happened since the last time they were together.
  Ama and her sister Ayita stood near the back. Her eyes were moist and she smiled when she saw her son surrounded by all the children. He hugged her and Ayita. Then Ama stood back and regarded him.
  “My famous son, the filthy hunter. Look at him!”
  “I swear he has grown two inches,” Ayita said.
  Ama turned to her sister, amused.
  “The children come up to me everyday. They say, when will the boy with the bow return? Do you know when he he will come back? I have to tell them I know as much as they do, and that I also await the return of the boy with the bow.”
  Ama and her sister laughed. They walked inside the village gates together and returned home to prepare for the feast that evening.
  Torches lit up the faces of all who had gathered there under the stars in the ceremonial grounds. There was food, so much food, though not of the variety they had in the days before the blight. The boy stuffed himself until he could barely move. He sat on the grass and patted his stomach. After the eating was the dancing. Drums were brought out and set in a large circle. Girl dressed in decorated skin dresses came out wearing turtle-shell rattles on their legs and forearms. They danced to the drums while others chanted popular songs about home and love.
  Leoti was there. He saw her from across the bonfire, with other girls. She looked around her for something. Or someone. He rose and crept around behind the tree, his eyes never leaving the dark-haired girl who was always in his thoughts. From there he crouched and wound through the groups of dancers and others who sat upon the grass. Then at last he was right behind her. She was talking to her friend, but then said in a loud voice.
  “I am no deer.”
  The boy said nothing. Suddenly his face was wet all over. Leoti turned and faced him directly, empty cup in hand. Her face was serious.
  “Are you stalking me, hunter?”
  “Hi, Leoti.”
  He wiped his face and himself grew serious, worried he had offended her.
  “Hi, Mika.” Leoti said. She kissed her hand and touched his cheek gently. Then she broke into a smile. The group of girls around her started to giggle.
  They walked on the grounds together, hand in hand. He had never seen such a beautiful creature in all his life. Her dark, smooth hair framing the round and delicate features of her face. Those eyes full of something he found hard to put into words, though *promise* was close.
  “You have grown strong.”
  “Everyone keeps saying that.”
  “It is true. Or maybe it is just your reputation that makes you seem so large and mighty. Kulsathee and the elders beam when they speak your name. Just like the children do.”
  They sat on the dark side of the tree together, out of sight of the others, and did not talk. When he did at last turn to her he could see the thing they had shared so often before, something like a belonging. She was his and he was hers and the world was something for them to share.
  That night he dreamt of Leoti and of her youthful beauty and the tenderness between them. In the dream they sat under tree as earlier in the night and he kissed her as he had not done then. When they kissed it was as if they became a single organism, melting one into the other, full of an all-consuming feeling of compassion towards all things. And then he woke.
  He threw off the skins and looked out the window, at the stars and the black shadows of the treetops moving in the breeze. In the next room he heard his mother sleeping. He put on a robe and walked outside and looked up. There was something he needed just now. He needed quiet. It was quiet. Everyone in the village was in their homes. The only sounds were the crickets in the forest and the breeze and the sound of his footsteps on the path. But he did not need quiet at all, really. He needed silence. Because something was not right. Something had not been right for a long time. His thoughts were not clear but he felt like he was close to something important. And there was too much noise here. He walked the path which went around the edge of the village, just inside the palisade walls. Too much noise to hear it.
  As a hunter he did a good thing for their tribe. He hunted the deer which fed their people. Before the blight it had been different. They grew crops also. But now it was necessary that every able male join the hunt in order to provide the only food source that could sustain them throughout the winter. It was about survival. He went back to the moment when the blight had been discovered and remembered every detail and asked himself if the choice that had been made was the right one. And every time the answer was yes. And no other choice was right. In every way he could conceive, it was right and good and true, this work he did. And yet,
  How wonderful the looks on the faces of the children today. How they looked up to him. They put feathers in their hair like he did himself. How he loved them. Those beautiful faces. And his family, so proud of him. Their hearts swollen with pride. How he loved them. And Leoti. The feeling of their togetherness was still with him. To provide for them, to use his strength and skills to hunt for the food, to provide his loved ones with food to survive the winter. It was a good thing. In every way he could conceive, it was good and true and right, this work he did. And yet,
  For a long time he had watched himself from the outside, as if he were a spirit watching from above. It was not him that excelled in the hunt. It was not him that received their loving kindess. It was not him.
  By now Mika had walked around the entire village and had returned to their house. It was quiet as before, but now his racing thoughts had calmed. He went to the shed and found the old bucket in a corner, full of debris. He emptied it and ran his fingers along the handle still wrapped in strands of grass from the prairie. He sat with it under the stars and at last found the silence he had needed all along. Because, it was only in the silence that he could hear it. Faint, because so much time had passed, because it had nearly been forgotten.

  *Do what I ask of you*

  It was time for the caravan to depart. The entire village was working to prepare for the journey. Two men pulled the cart to the southern gates, where it was packed with fresh hunting equipment and processing supplies. The hunters themselves put on fresh gear which their wives and mothers had sewn for them. Several novices had been tasked with napping fresh arrowheads from flint and restringing their bows. Though busy the mood among the villagers was calm. The weather was fair, clear with high wisps of clouds in the western sky.
  Mika had risen with the sun, it slanting through the window onto his face. He had breakfast and went to the shed. Inside he took the bucket and set it outside. The old satchel he pulled from a chest in the house. Its worn leather strap needed repairing and he set to work on that, reinforcing it with a soft piece of buckskin. Then when that was done he emptied the basket of pemmican he had horded from various locations the past few days. Altogether it was seven pounds of food. From another chest in the shed he took out some old netting, used for fishing in lakes and rivers. He grabbed a few lures and tossed those into the satchel as well. Finally he threw in a sharpening stone and couple of small knives.
  Nearby he heard the sounds of the villagers. There was food and music. He heard several laughing. Some tearful goodbyes. Yaholo and his apprentices were performing a blessing ritual and accompanying it were loud whoops and whistles.
  The boy pulled off his mocassins and wrapped the soles in tough buckskin, which would last much longer than the normal soft leather. He secured it with twine and then wrapped them all in long strips of supple deerskin. These would not cause blisters, though they did not breath as well, and would sweat. As he slipped them on his mother approached down the path. She had been with the others and her face was serious and frowning.
  “Why are you not with the caravan? It departs soon. Yaholo already performed the ceremony. Others are saying their farewells as we speak.”
  He tightened the straps around his shoes and stood up.
  “I am not going with them.”
  “What do you mean? You must go.”
  Ama looked at him, her gaze resolute. The boy met her eyes, but then turned away.
  “Where are you going?”
  He looked to the mountains. His mother was puzzled.
  “But you have. I remember when you left. I remember when you returned. You have done it.”
  “No,” the boy confessed, “I failed, mama. I was ashamed of my failure so I hid it from you. But I failed before and now I must try again, and not fail.”
  Her eyes drifted off, in thought, then returned.
  “Mika, the tribe depends on you. Now is not the time for such things. Every man who is able to hunt must do so. Don’t you remember the words of Kulsathee. The decree he made. It is not for you to question. It is for the survival of our village. I know you loved your father. So did I. Do you think whatever is out there is more important than doing your part? Things are going well now but that may change. Nothing is certain.”
  The boy looked at his mother.
  “This is certain.”
  He opened the satchel and checked all its contents to make sure he had not forgotten anything. The sounds of the villagers echoed down the path, their voices enthusiastic, cheerful. His mother did not speak for many minutes. When he was done he looked up and saw her crying.
  “You are mistaken about that. In his last days, your father was not in his right mind. Truth be told, he had not been well for a long time. He was sick and feverous. His thoughts were not his own. Please understand that. Whatever it was that he asked you to do, it was because of the sickness. It was the fever on his brain and nothing more.”
  With those words she was silent, and sat on the log outside their house. The boy thought about the things she said. He picked his things from the ground, his knife, the bucket whose handle was wrapped with a thick layer of grass. He tucked the knife in his satchel and gripped the bucket in his free hand. Then he leaned over and kissed the top of her head and set off on the path into the village center. He looked back once before rounding the corner but she was not watching him go. She stared  at a faraway place. He was alone.
  The path through the center of the village took him near the people gathered to see off the caravan. As he came around the group of hunters were in sight. His friend Tye saw him and motioned for him to hurry up. When the boy kept walking he cupped his hands around his mouth as if to shout, but then stopped. He saw something in his eyes to make him stop. The boy made the gesture of their friendship but Tye did not return it. *Though you are my friend, I must go alone*.
  He came upon the townhouse on the mound and outside stood Kulsathee and the elders. They watched the caravan from afar and were dressed as if it were a celebration. Their faces regarded the boy as he passed them by. He met eyes with the chief of peace and saw no sense of familiarity in them, impassive and cold. *Though I honor you, I must go alone*.
  Then at last he went through a crowd of women and saw Leoti among them. They were carrying turtle-shell rattles in their hands and wore feathers in their hair. Her face lit up when she saw him but then fell as she realized he was headed away from the caravan and all the others. The boy wanted very much to stop and tell her everything he was feeling, but he kept going. *Though you have my heart, I must go alone*.
  He went through the center of the village and along the path that led out to the northern gates. From here he could still hear the crowds. They wished the departing hunters well and told them to remember them on the hunt. Their voices grew fainter the closer he got to the gate.
  Because it was a special occassion there was no lookout on post at the gates. He went up and unlatched the pole securing them from the inside. Then he pushed on one of the gates until it swung open just wide enough for him to get through. When he was on the outside he pushed it closed. Someone would find it later and secure the latch. He went to the river.

  At last he reached the campsite where he had turned his back on the mountains. The firepit still contained the charred and ashen limbs. The cleared place in the grass where he slept. The little twig he had stuck in the ground as a marker. All there. All the same. Except now he was not the same. He was no longer the weak boy who had made that unprepared journey. In his satchel were plenty slabs of pemmican. He had rationed them from his first night on the river path. Some nights he had caught fish in the river, using the netting he brought along. His feet had blistered, that was unavoidable on such a trek, but his shoes had held together from the reinforcements. The blisters had calloused over and no longer bothered him. His palms had also calloused and the bucket no longer troubled him.
  He camped that night under the stars. He cooked pemmican over the fire and slept soundly. Then in the morning, even before sunrise, he was back on the path, the distant mountains a dark monolith against the predawn horizon.
  The days went by. He did not often look twenty yards in front of him. That was all he needed to find his way. The river was guide enough. The grass and small trees of the prairie grew sparse until one day he found himself walking on stubby grass and hardened ground. He looked up and saw isolated rock formations and escarpments to higher plateaus. Little vegetation. Mosses, shrubs. No life. The mountains which had been so far away were upon him. Its summit loomed above, the highest peak surrounded by a halo of clouds. He still had a long way to go.
  That night he stopped early and chopped some shubs for firewood and built a fire. He pulled the netting from his satchel and crouched near the river bank and waited until he saw a fish. He was there for a long time waiting but at last he saw three of them in a group and tossed the netting wide. It sank into the moving water. He let it sink and then snatched it up quickly. Trapped inside it was flopping about. He bashed it onto a large rock and thanked it for offering its life. Then he cleaned it with his knife and skewered it with a leftover twig. He held it over the fire and breathed in the smell of its flesh cooking over the flame. He was famished.
  The food he ate replenished his energy so that he could continue the next day, but it was not enough to make him full. Not enough to maintain his weight. Already his ribs were visible and he had lost muscle. Sometimes he leaned over the river surface and looked at his gaunt silouette. 
  Other times he wondered how much time he had actually spent out here. It was a funny thing. Time did not seem to pass the same as it did in the valley. There were days and nights, and the sun rose in the east and went down in the west. Still he found that at any particular moment he could only remember fragments. Time and memory blurred into a single moment.
  He picked at the fish until it was all bone and then pulled a blanket over him and went to sleep, the temperature at this altitude cool, and when the wind blew it was even cold. In the morning he ate breakfast and got back on the path. 
  The boy did not think about home while he walked. That he would not allow himself to do, remembering the loneliness and how it had overcome him before. At times he spoke aloud just to keep the sense of isolation at bay.
  “I am on the path”, he said often, as if to remind him, “I am on the path.”
  The wind at this altitude blew around the ridges and boulders, resembling the ceaseless crashing of waves on a beach. The bucket caught the wind and tugged at his arm the entire day. With the wind blew the cloud vapor at certain times of the day. It created a dense fog and slowed his progress considerably since he couldn’t see ten feet in front of him. At these times he relied on the rush of the river to guide him.
  One afternoon he was in the cloud fog and had been thinking of kanuchi soup and fried bean-and-corn bread when his mind snapped into focus. He no longer could hear the river. He immediately turned back and traced his path. It was hard to tell in this fog. The sound of the wind made it hard to distinguish the river. Then he found it again and saw why he had lost it in the first place.
  There was a small mouth in a gathering of small boulders. This was where the river emerged from inside the mountain. It was much too small for him to enter, about two feet high. He crouched and looked inside but there was only darkness. He climbed to the top of the boulders where the ground leveled off and placed his ear to the ground. He could both feel the vibration of the river and hear the muffled rush of the water.
  Sometime later the clouds dissipated and the boy could see what lie ahead. There was a steep grade only navigable from the piles of rocks and boulders. He kept going. At certain times he would listen at the ground for the river, but it was always there to lead him in the right direction, which was not always a straight line or the easiest route.
  Ahead he spotted a natural archway in the rocks. It appeared to create an entrance of some kind. He was not yet high enough to see what lie beyond. It might have been his imagination. He listened at the ground and heard the sound of the river. He climbed up the staggered plateaus common on the summit. The archway was beautiful. From certain vantages he thought it could even have been man-made, so elegant and smooth were its contours. *I was created*, it said. Many generations ago their ancestors had lived in these mountains, the Old Ones.
  He reached the archway and stood momentarily beneath its high reach. It made him dizzy. He walked into what appeared to be a cavern of some kind, though opened at the top. The sunlight shining down in a slant onto the rock walls. The sound of the wind blowing through the cavern was deafening. He cupped one hand around his left ear. As he walked he saw an opening in the ground and as he got closer he heard the sound of the river. It echoed off the high, angled ceiling and reverberated into echoes. 
  The boy walked to the edge and saw that the opening was actually a chasm. The dark of the shadows grew deeper the further he peered into it. By the smooth rush the water made he knew the water must be deep at the bottom. But all he could see was the dark. He picked up a small stone and dropped it over the edge. He listened for a splash but there was too much competing noise.
  Mika surveyed the width of the chasm. It was thirty feet across. Impossible for him to leap. He thought perhaps he had made a mistake after all. Perhaps there had been a better approach up the slope than listening for the river. He retraced his footsteps outside to where the cavern plateau dropped off. Along the mountainside shear cliffs rose to great heights. Impossible to climb. He looked beyond the chasm and at the other end of the cavern, he caught a glint of sunlight which blinded him until he shielded his eyes. It was an opening.
  The boy sat cross-legged at the edge of the chasm. He listened to the roar of the river. The roar he heard at the bottom of the chasm but could not see. Sometime later he rose and took a piece of twine from his satchel. He tied it around the handle of the bucket and then around his right arm. He tugged at it to make sure it was secure and then inched up to the ledge, and went over.

  Down he plunged into the murk. Seconds later his feet pierced the river surface and he sank right to the bottom. When he felt the hard ground underfoot he shoved against it with all his strength and clawed his way back up. The bucket had filled with water and felt like a boulder around his forearm. Quickly he fought to flip it around and tuck it firmly in the crook of his arm. This reduced the drag and allowed him to swim upwards.
  At last he emerged and gasped for air, kicking his legs to remain in one place. All around him was the dark but in some places the light from the cavern above reflected on the water and revealed a path deeper into the chasm. He swam against the current while holding the bucket aloft with one free arm. When that arm started to lose blood flow he switched to the other and slowly made progress upstream, which because of the depth was not too swift.
  When both arms became tired he went to one side of the chasm and treaded in place for a few mintues. Looking up he saw a small gash of light where he had leapt. He had fallen far. The smooth walls of the chasm were cold to the touch and provided little for him to hold. He went on. 
  Repeating the cycle of swimming and resting on the side of the chasm he slowly made his way upstream. Then his gamble paid off when he emerged into an underground area. There was no more light coming above, but that was okay because there was another light source somewhere in the distance. How far it was impossible to tell. He swam hard against the current in the direction of this light, hoping to reach it before his arms gave out entirely.
  Soon he saw the light was coming from the entrance to some passage among the rock walls of the cavern. Before he knew it his legs kicked against the ground. He stood up and rested, then then walked the rest of the way to the passage.
  Dim beams of sunlight fell onto the beach at the entrance. The rock ground was slick with algae and tiny pebbles. This passage looked to be a natural formation but had been used by Old Ones at some point in history, because all along the passage walls leading up he saw petroglyphs. He turned the bucket upside down and sat on the beach. The engravings were of animals and other shapes he did not recognize. They told some story he was too fatigued to decipher.
  He looked up the passageway and could not see where it led. There were turns and side passages. When he had rested enough he picked up the bucket and started the climb. The floor of the passage was slick and his wet shoes lost their grip at times and he fell. His knees were bruised by the time he got around the first turn.
  It was quiet. The sound of the river became muffled. All he could hear was the scuff of his footsteps. The light grew brighter and glistened on the undulating stone that made up the passage. It had been carved from countless eons of waterflow. The boy could feel its age in the subtle layers of it. 
  Soon the steep incline leveled off and he approached another turn. From here he could see the exit as a bright circle of illumination. But there was another way to go. To the left was another passage. The light did not enter there. As he approached his eyes were drawn into its shadows. Something was there. Something alive was just out of sight in that darkness. He heard its breaths and the closer he came he saw its eyes reflecting light from the exit, though he could not make out its shape. Then it noticed him and he panicked. His heartbeat pounding in his chest. Slowly he removed the hunting knife from its sheath and stood very still.
  “Do not be afraid, traveler,” it spoke to him from the darkness, its voice a low growl, much like the sounds of the brown bears which roam the hills of his valley.
  Then he saw its shape emerge from those shadows. It was a brown bear, reared up on its hind legs, but he knew that it was really no bear at all. He gripped his knife to be prepared.
  “Please put down your weapon, traveler,” the bear said, “Come with us inside. We have fire to keep us warm. We have food to fill our belly. So many travelers have come this way before. All travelers must join us in time.”
  It came closer still.
  “Stay back,” he said, “Return to the place you came from.”
  It flashed its teeth and reared its claws but came no closer to him. Then the bear, who was really no bear at all, backed away until it was once more two eyes glowering in the darkness. The boy sheathed the knife and walked slowly past it, and tempted though he was, he did not look once in its direction.
  As he exited the passage he held one arm over his eyes. The sunlight was very bright. After a few minutes his vision had adjusted and he could not believe what he saw. Ruins of a city surrounding a vast lake.
  The boy climbed down and navigated through the ruins to the lake shore. There he peeled off his clothes to dry in the sun and stuck one toe into the shallows. It was cold, but no colder than the river he had just emerged from. He removed the netting from his satchel and waded in up to his knees. The water was clear and he could see the rocks on the bottom, small pebbles of various shades of brown and gray. His feet sank into the rocks. Then he saw little fish nosing at his shins. There were dozens of them, translucent silver with a rainbow sheen. He swam out where his feet no longer touched the bottom. He could only see a few feet into those depths.
  He drug the net through the clear water and brought up a few fish, flopping within, and was overjoyed. Later he wandered the ruins and found enough kindling from dried bushes to build a fire. He skewered the fish and roasted them over the flame and stuffed himself. By then the sun was going down. It was getting colder. Already the moon was visible in the eastern skies, its reflection mirrored in the stillness of the lake. Before bedding down for the night the boy went to the lake and dipped the bucket underwater. He filled it to the brim.

  Over the next few days Mika rested. The weather remained clear, hot during the day but cold in the evenings. He spent his waking hours exploring the ruins. When he worked up a sweat he went for swims in the lake and dried out on the rocky beach. When he was hungry he caught fish and cooked them and feasted until he almost burst. One morning he rose with the sun and knew it was time to go back.
  While exploring he had also gathered materials he could use to weave a makeshift bridge, in order to cross back over the chasm. Using thin twigs and vines along with sturdy flat pieces of stone he built one over the course of the morning. His mother had taught him basketmaking when he was very young and he drew on those skills. When he was finished it was ugly but would hopefully get him across.
  He carried the bridge up the terraced plateaus to the cavern archway, where he had entered the lake area a few days ago. The lip of the bridge caught on a few sharp points and he had to be careful not to force it. At the archway the constant wind caught his hair and blew it back. He drug the bridge to the edge of the chasm. It looked plenty long enough, but if he had not measured right, it would likely fall. He raised the entire bridge lengthwise and let it come down with gravity. It landed with a thud, safely across the chasm gap.
  When he shifted it into a more secure angle he grabbed a heavy stone and heaved it onto the part of the bridge over the chasm. It sunk and the binding creaked under the weight, but it gave him confidence it would hold.
  The boy returned to camp and gathered his things. He had also made a lid for the bucket and secured it with a piece of twine so the water would not spill out on the journey home. He took one final look at the lake and the ruins and then climbed up to the cavern entrance.
  With trepidation he placed one foot onto the bridge. Then he placed the other. He was not even close to the center and it was already sagging. He took a deep breath and darted across the entire length as fast as he could, keeping each footstep as light and quick as possible. At the center the bridge sagged so far down the final stretch was like running uphill. He made it.
  Under the archway he stood and saw the expanse of highlands and foothills stretching to the horizon. Beyond it the prairie, then the valley. Then home. He took in the vista and then climbed down to get onto the path.
  Now that it was full of water, the bucket was the heaviest thing he carried. His arms grew tired even after switching one to the other. This caused him to rest more frequently and so he did not make the same kind of progress as the journey to the summit. Every time he set the bucket down he was nervous it would spill. So he kept it tucked between his knees.
  He had brought three roasted fish in his satchel. These lasted a couple days, after which he was back to dragging the net in the river. Like before he was able to catch one or so every night. This gave him enough energy to make progress for the day. But he was always hungry. Very hungry. To keep his focus on the path he navigated by whatever landmarks he could reach in a single day. The rest of the time he kept his eyes on the ground at his feet and merely placed one foot in front of the other, without stoppping. At night he camped, with a fire when there was firewood, with fish when he was lucky to catch them. Days passed. Then weeks. And then one day he looked up and saw he was in the valley.
  He recognized the oaks and maples. He recognized the familiar bends of the river. The meadows and the gorge. His heart swelled with nostalgia and when he at last rounded the small bend in the path and saw the familiar wood palisades of the village he broke into tears. Joyful tears. 
  He reached the gates and stood. There were two lookouts on platforms, high above. They recognized him. One of them cupped his hands and shouted below. There was movement behind the gates and then Gawoni poked his head out of one of the lookout holes. Then he shouted down.
  “Open the gates. It is him alright. Such as he is.”
  “He does not look the same. He looks sick.”
  “I can count his ribs from here.”
  The gates swung open and the boy picked up the bucket and his satchel and went inside. He nodded to the lookouts but they were stonefaced. He walked the path through the village center and looked around in amazement. Everything was exactly the same and yet looked completely different to his eyes. He saw familiar faces emerge from their homes.
  “A miracle. I thought he was dead for sure.”
  “Yet here he is.”
  “But where is the rest of him?”
  The villagers laughed.
  “The boy with the bow has come back to us.”
  “Doubt he’ll be drawing bowstrings anytime soon. Look at those arms.”
  “I don’t know. He carries the bucket well.”
  “Now he is the boy with the bucket.”
  There were laughs at that. Some shouted at their friends or family. More joined the crowd.
  “What’s the bucket?”
  “I don’t know.”
  “Where is he going?”
  Others heard the commotion and by the time the boy had reached the ceremonial grounds the entire population of the village had come to see him who had been gone for so long. He saw his mother in the crowd. She dried her eyes and looked upon him with pitying eyes. He saw the elders, even Kulsathee. He saw Leoti but she turned away when they met eyes. Mohe was there. When he came to the ceremonial grounds they did not follow him. Instead the stopped at the low gates and gossiped to one another in hushed whispers. 
  He walked up to the tree and stared up at its branches. Then he lifted off the makeshift lid from the bucket and gently poured its contents into the ground around the trunk. The dry earth soaked up the water and was gone. Then he set the bucket on the ground and stood by and he waited.
 
  It was an overcast day in early autumn. The pack of hunters stopped to rest on a high ridge, overlooking a meadow. This was the spot Turkeyfoot, a scout, had discovered a herd of doe the previous morning.
  “Twenty strong. No lie.”
  A shallow creek wound through the area, its current swift and water clear. Mist-sodden leaves from the surrounding trees patchworked the ground in shades of red, yellow, and brown. One of the elder hunters pointed to the creek.
  “No doubt the water brings them here.”
  The others nodded in agreement.
  Turkeyfoot pointed out the exact spot he saw the herd emerge from the forest line. He had been long in these woods tracking the movements of another tribe while hunting deeper inside the neighboring valley.
  The elder huntsment surveyed the clearing and the best strategy would be a deer drive, a method of hunting which uses carefully arranged hunters to push a herd into an area where they have no escape and are therefore easily picked off with bow and arrow, typically from a high vantage point.
  It started to drizzle and the men draped their coats over their heads and ducked underneath some outcroppings on the ridge. Drizzled turned to rain and pattered on the rocks and onto the treetops. Cold pemmican was rationed to the men and they sat together and ate. Because of the long trek they were famished and most of them finished off their portion quickly and asked for another, which they were granted with a reluctant grunt. As they ate they debated strategies for the drive.
  In a deer drive the hunters are divided into three groups - drivers, standers, and snipers. Depending on the location there are many possible ways to arrange the groups, and how many of each should be used. For this drive there was not much argument where the snipers should be. The ridge had a perfect view of the meadow and the shear cliff would be a good barrier against which to drive the herd.
  Mika ate his ration in silence. He did not talk much since his return and nobody much talked to him. He was very underweight and though his strength had come back, his skills were nothing like they were before, and everyone knew it. He listened to the other hunters argue about where the driving line should be placed, which was important to them.
  “That isn’t right. We should be as close as possible to the cliff edge, but adjacent to it. Like so.”
  The hunter held up his arms in a cross shape to indicate what he meant to the others. They nodded, thoughtfully.
  “No. You want the first line waiting by the southern edge of the woods, assuming the herd approaches from the east. Isn’t that where Turkeyfoot spotted them?”
  “Don’t remember.”
  Another hunter shouted to the scout, who was off by himself, observing distant plumes of campfire smoke.
  “What side did they come from again?”
  “The west.”
  “Oh, I had it wrong. In that case, the first line needs to be there, and down fifty feet or so.”
  “That is way too far.”
  The boy listened to them but did not join in. At one time he might have been interested in that sort of thing. Not anymore. He no longer cared about the hunt. Not since he returned from the mountains. He did his duty. But he did not care. He did feel a pang of guilt about his apathy. It seemed to him like he ought to care. It was important after all, to feed their tribe. And everyone else seemed to care so much. He watched them become impassioned and turn red with anger when there was a disagreement.
  “It doesn’t matter what you think! It is not your decision at the end of the day. The elders will decide where to post every hunter, that includes drivers, standers, and even snipers.”
  “That is true,” a few echoed.
  “All I know is I better be posted as a sniper. I’m tired of being looked over.”
  “But you are a stander if I ever saw one. You stand well.”
  The others laughed. The one who wanted to be a sniper rose and made and obscene gesture at the rest of them. That only made them laugh harder.
  “You all are a bunch of frog eaters! I am a sniper. I’m going to talk with the elders. They know my aim is true. The elders know.”
  He stomped off and the other hunters watched him go, the boy included. He sat among them and laughed when they did, became serious when they became serious. He did everything he was supposed to do as a hunter.
  Yet ever since his return, all his waking thoughts were on the mountains and the lake he had found on its summit. Just as his father said he would. He thought about how he had watered the tree and how nothing had come of it after all. How the villagers mocked him because of that. Nothing at all.
  Soon the rain cleared and blue skies appeared. Ther ewas a cool wind that blew in and rustled the leaves on the trees and shook loose ones from their limbs so that they fell in lazy arcs to the ground. The elders gathered everyone and instructed them where they would post during the drive. 
  The snipers included Tye and all the best with a bow, those whose aim was true and could be relied upon. The hunter who insisted he was a sniper was not among them, but he was made a driver which placated him. The drivers were the largest group by far. They had to be strong and nimble on their feet. The last group was the standers. Nobody wanted to be posted as a stander during a drive. Yet the stander was also important. They were placed at certain locations and were responsible to hold ground and act like a human wall. The boy was selected for this role and joined the others in his group.
  Both drivers and standers were told to descend the ridge and get into their positions. They set off together with an elder to guide them to the correct spots. They had to double their pace as it was already late afternoon and had to be in position by dusk, when the herd was most likely to return.
  In the meadow the boy was told to stand at the northern edge of the clearing. This was an important spot because it was the widest gap between standers. The main driver line would be approaching from the opposite side so there was a good chance the herd would flee in this direction. The elder walked up and addressed him when he had crouched behind a treestump.
  “Are you prepared?”
  “I am.”
  From this spot the boy had a view of the entire meadow. He sat and watched as the blue afternoon skies turned to pale orange and pink. The trees were bathed in an amber glow from the descending sun, their bark darkened and still wet. He smelled the soil, sodden from the rain. All was quiet except for the creek trickling. He took in his surroundings and was taken back to a particular evening in the foothills when the skies had looked the same. It was a peaceful day, a good day out there. He  made good progress and at the end of it was exhausted in both body and mind. At camp that evening he netted a fish and could still smell it roasting on a skewer over the flames. He lay on the ground and counted as the stars appeared one by one,
  “Hunter, stand your ground!”
  The boy glanced up. He saw a deer in mid-stride, careening towards him, followed by the herd. He jumped to his feet and clumsily made the wide, stomping motions he had been trained for. But the deer leapt past, unafraid. Another grazed his arm and knocked him into the ground, his face buried in the soft dirt. In danger of being trampled he ducked behind the stump and curled into a ball. After, he rose and wiped the mud from his face and eyes.
  He saw the other hunters emerge from their places. Their heads  were hung in disbelief. The elder huntsmen cupped his hands and shouted up to the ridge, where one of the other huntsmen stood, hands on knees.
  “Head us back to camp. We missed our chance. This herd will not come again.”
  The huntsmen on the ridge frowed. He whistled for his men to pack up and then surveyed the meadow and remarked on the bounty that had been lost to them.
  “It is a shame.”
 
  On the return journey Mika kept pace behind the caravan, well behind the group of hunters and elders, who walked together. Tye was among them. His friend had not spoken to him since his return and avoided him whenever they camped. A few days later the caravan arrived at the southern gates and there was the usual crowd of family and friends. They had already news of the poor harvest and were thus more subdued than usual. Mika could not find his mother nor any of his relatives among the people. He walked home alone. 
  Inside was empty. His mother’s belongings were gone. Fearing the worst he ran to the house where his aunt lived. To his relief he saw his mother on the porch, playing with his nephew. He called out to her but his aunt Ayita emerged from the house and held up finger to stop him.
  “Do not come any closer to our house. You are not welcome here. Do you understand? Your mother has come to stay with us. We have decided that for now, this is the right thing to do. A woman her age should be able to rely on her son to be there, especially after losing a husband. But you cannot be relied on, can you? On a whim you decide to go on an adventure, so you take right off, with no thought given to the well-being of your mother or to the others who depend on you. Not just your family. The tribe too. You are a selfish, spoiled boy in my opinion. You have no sense of loyalty. You have no sense of duty. When your father died you were to become the man of the household. With that comes responsibility. And you did step up. You did the right thing, at first. When the blight came you did your part. I admit that. But when you left you made a decision what was really important to you, and who was really important to you. Yourself. Your father was such a decent man and a beloved leader in our tribe. He helped so many and not just his family. But I knew something had not been passed on to you. From the time you were crawling on the ground. I knew you were not truly the son of your father. For some reason you always thought you were special. You were just a little better than the rest of us. That has been obvious for a long time, and your leaving like you did only proves it. Kulsathee decreed that every able male go to the hunt. Not because he wants to wield his power to control others. But because that is what is necessary to feed us throughout the winter. For our survival. But you get an idea in your head and think that is more important than a decree from your chief and the elders. The arrogance of that! So you left your mother, and everyone, wondering where you had gone and when you would return. Every day she had to face the people in the village and apologize for your absense. At night she would come to me and cry for hours. How does that make you feel? Do you feel good? Was it worth it? I know the story. Sakima asked you to fetch a bucket of lake water and give it to that old tree. It is good that you want to honor the memory of your father. But there is a time and place for such things. To be a man is to understand what things should come first. You have shown that you are no man. You are still a boy. How will you provide for Ama? That is my concern. You say you are back to the hunt? Great. Keep it up. Prove you can provide for my sister, your mother, and she will come home again. Prove that you are a good son and someone to be relied upon and she will come home.”
  Ayita spit at his feet and stormed off into the house. From the porch his mother had heard the entire thing and her head was bowed, sobbing into her hand. Mika stood there for a few minutes, unsure what to say, and then left.
  He walked through the village center. There were children playing on the path. As he went by they mocked him behind his back and threw little rocks at his heels, causing him to stumble. He ignored them and went outside the gates. He walked the path among the pines and oaks. 
   Mika came to the small pond where he and Leoti sometimes watched the sunrise together. She was there. Next to her was Mohe. They sat on the log holding hands and smiling about something. It was too late for him to change course so he continued walking by. As he approached they both looked up. Caught unaware, they blushed. On their faces was a dazed expression. As if they had just been awoken from a lovely dream. They exchanged knowing glances and turned to Mika.
  His neck grew hot. He started to tremble and did not know what to say to either of them. He merely smiled and nodded to them both. They returned his smile. Then he waved and continued walking along the path. A little ways down he looked back and saw Leoti was watching him over her shoulder, her gaze a sad confession, *He was here and not you*.

  As the sun dropped below the treeline he arrived at his boyhood home. He went inside and prepared dinner. He ate deer jerky in the empty house as the twilight faded into night. He lit a candle and became lost in its glow. Somehow the thought of being alone at home was unbearable in the nighttime. [MEMORY OF BETTER DAYS IN THE HOUSE] In the day it was not so bad but now a feeling of isolation came to him, a feeling of panic, as if he were trapped. The stillness in the room was like a tomb. He started to cry. He cried like he had not since the seven days of mourning. “Father, tell me what to do,” he whispered, “I am truly lost.”
  He imagined the spirit of his father like a mist in the same room, illuminated from within. He would ask him why he must water the tree. There seemed no good path. If only he would appear. But then, he knew such things did not happen in real life. Only in stories did they happen.
  He went to bed and wrapped himself in fur blankets. He tried to put the image of Leoti and Mohe out of his mind. He tried to forget Ayita cursing him, his mother crying. He saw the herd of deer in flight, barreling towards him. The despondant look on the faces of the elders. He saw the back of his friend Tye on the journey home. Then he saw other things. He saw a tribe with more people than he had ever seen before. Like ants they were. Like ants they moved through a labryinth of stone pathways, through mechanisms of vast complexity. Their buildings were carved to perfection from stone and unnatural materials, polished to gleam in the sun. They built machines with their hands and their minds. They built machines to build machines. It was beautiful to see, and horrible. He wondered the kinds of thoughts that were in their minds and the kinds of feelings that were in their hearts. The villages where they lived had few trees and ponds. There were no seasons anymore. They harnessed the strength of the elements to do their work. They harnessed the water and the fire and the wind. With machines they grew crops large enough to feed the world, yet some grew fat while others wasted away to skin and bones. With machines they healed their sick and dying. With machines they slaughtered their own. With machines they scorched the land. With machines they launched their bodies into the heavens, among the stars which have no end.

  He was on the path. Drenched from three days of rainstorms he slogged across the muddy rise of the foothills into the highlands where at last he found dry ground under a granite overhang. He made camp there and lost consciousness from exhaustion and hunger but it was not good rest and he woke in the morning tired and his mind foggy. He was hungry and very weak. It had been days since he had caught any fish. He dragged the river and caught a small trout. With no chance of starting a fire he skinned and gutted the fish and ate it raw. His energy returned and he set off again.
  Rain fell in sheets over the mountains. The wind beat the rain into his eyes so he kept his head down and his eyes on the ground. Water from higher ground ran downhill and funneled into falls and rivulets, and finally into the river which had flooded its banks and made the entire area into a bog. At this altitude the temperature dropped so that his breath came out as fog. His furs were soaked through and frozen at the ends. Since the rain started he had gotten used to the weight of it but the cold weather made it almost more than he could bear.
  In the afternoon the sky darkened and lightning flashed behind the far ridge. The thunder rolled and soon after the rain poured down in torrents. Mika could not see. He found an overhang near some boulders and took refuge there. When the storm passed and the rain let up he continued.
  He came to the escarpment where the river entered the mountain. A dark fog obscured the summit above, but he was near the summit and his heart lifted to know his destination was close. He was very tired and hungry. He pushed himself onto the rock slope to the next plateau but it was slick with mud and rain and he toppled backwards and slid backwards to the bottom. He lay on the ground for some time. His knee was bruised and cut on the rocks. He was in pain but also weary of all this.
  The bucket had rolled into the riverbed and was being carried downstream. He saw it and heaved himself onto his feet. His knee hurt but he scrambled after the bucket. He saw it go underwater and dove into the spot and grasped in desperation for it. He found the handle and pulled it out.
  Then he collapsed onto the ground and placed his head into his hands. He could take no more. He felt a heaviness inside, a sense of futility. The rain and the mud and the cold. It was too much for him to bear. It felt like all the energy of the world was harmonized to destroy him body and soul. He trembled as he wept on the ground, the rain washing his tears into the mud at his feet, *No more. Please no more. I will turn back forever.*
  By the next morning the clouds had lifted and patches of blue appeared in the overcast skies. The rain stopped and the wind blew cold. Mika rose with the sun. He looked up and admired the clear weather. He could see to the summit now and in the place where the archway should have been was an avalanche of rocks and boulders. He took his time and found footing to climb the escarpment and steep inclines and boulders leading to the summit cavern. When he reached the place where the archway should have been he looked for a way through, any ingress at all. But there was nothing. The passage was entirely closed off to him. He climbed down from the ridge to the place where the river entered the mountain. The overflowing stream ran swift and angry over the rocks. He looked in either direction, along the line of the mountains. Sheer cliffs in both directions. He gazed up at the sun in the sky and because it was in the east he went in that direction.
  The way was hard. Rock shards on the path east cut into the tough soles of his mocassins. He tried to avoid them but there were too many. After a few miles he looked down and saw blood seeping through the leather. He stopped and wrapped some twine around his shoes for more protection. Then kept going. By now his waterlogged clothes had dried out and somewhat eased his burden. To camp out here would be hard. Because there was no river there was no fish. And he was very weak. He felt the necessity to stay near a food source. He walked until it was afternoon. Then he had to make a decision to continue and camp out here, or return to the river, where he might be able to catch something to eat.
  He walked until the sun dropped below the ridge and the light dimmed into twilight. Then he saw an imperfection in the cliffside not too far ahead. He quickened his pace in order to reach it before dark. When he got close he saw that it was some kind of cave. Or not a cave really, but a narrow canyon. Now it was too dark to see very far into it. He picked up a rock and threw it in. He heard it echo and bounce off the walls somewhere deep inside. This gave him some kind of hope. He set camp just inside the narrow slot of the canyon. Any brush or wood was still far too wet to make a fire, so he made a bed of his furs and went to sleep cold and hungry.
  At first light he rose and started into the canyon. The way was narrow. Every shuffle of his feet echoed up the high walls. Looking up he saw a sliver of the morning sky. It became narrow. So narrow he had to turn sideways and walk with his hands out, in order to compress his breadth. Still he felt the sides of the canyon poke into his back and stomach. Then it became narrower. He had to remove his furs and skins. He dragged all his belongings on the ground while he inched through the gap. At the last it became so narrow he had to force himself through. He felt the cold, hard stone dig into his back and chest. Then he was through and the canyon widened. Rays of light shone down from above. He came out of the other side and onto a plateau overlooking a vista.
  There was a shallow river. He stepped through it, going in the direction of the summit. It took him half a day of travel to reach where it ought to be. The ascent was not to steep. The ground was covered in ground moss and gave him plenty of foothold. He pulled himself up the side of the mountain, grabbing onto rocks sometimes. Then he saw it.
  Hewn into the mountain was a staircase of flat stones, eroded but still good to use. He traced its route with his eyes, watching it snake up near the summit, though he couldn’t see where it ended from here. He found a walking stick and began the ascent. The stairs were steep and if he stepped wrong there was nothing to keep him from toppling over the side. As he went higher the plateau below grew smaller. He saw the river he had crossed earlier that morning, from here a thin ribbon of gray.
  He tested the sturdiness of each stone with the walking stick before he placing his foot onto it. This made his climb slower but it gave him a feeling of security. He came to a broad lip where there was enough space to sit down so he stopped to rest for awhile. He was weak. His entired body trembled uncontrollably. He feared of what would happen if there was no entrance to the summit at the top of the staircase. In his mind he saw the avalanche over the archway. When rested he continued. But he grew careless in his anxiety and forgot to check the sturdiness of the stones. He stepped onto one and it slid from its place and went over the side, crashing against the side of the mountain until it shattered far below. He nearly lost his balance but used the stick to hold him steady.
  When he neared the summit he saw there was another archway where the stairs ended. It was nestled between large outcroppings and was only visible when you were upon it. He quicked his pace and made it there.
  It was a man-made passsage, utterly dark inside. He was afraid to enter but when he looked down and saw how far he had come it strengthened his resolve and he used the walking stick to feel his way through. A steady draft blew against him. With it came an unfamiliar earthen smell, like mushrooms. The passage wound as much as the staircase he had climbed up the mountain. There was a low incline.
  Then ahead he saw light. As he reached the area he knew he was near the summit. One side of the passage had fallen away, exposing the plateau and the stairway and he saw the archway tiny below. He now saw there were petroglyphs all along the walls of the passage, dimly lit. There was one final climb of stairs ahead of him.
  As he started up he saw to his right a corridor. Inside the corridor was the same darkness he had just come through. But there was something else. A sound. He listened and heard a hard thump on the ground. His heart leapt. As his eyes became accustomed to the dark, with the dim light he saw the writhing shape, like two copperheads mating. They rose from the ground as a single organism and whipped the ground hard.
  “Do not be afraid, traveler,” the snakes hissed.
  Mika unsheathed his knife and stood completely still. The snakes inched nearer to him. He held up his knife.
  “Please, put down your weapon, traveler,” the snakes said, “Come with us inside. We tell jokes to make us laugh. We give hugs to make us feel loved. So many travelers have come this way before. All travelers must join us in time.”
  They came closer.
  “Stay back,” the boy threatened, “Return to the place you came from.”
  They bared their fangs and hissed but did not come any closer to him. Then the snakes, who were not really snakes at all, slithered back into the dark until he could only hear them writhing. Mika sheathed his knife and walked slowly past. He continued up the stairway.
  He came out of the passage and into daylight. The skies were clear and blue. He breathed in the fresh air. Before him stood the lake, still and wide. He had emerged on the opposite shore. Dimly he could see the other side. It would take him hours to reach his former campsite from here.
  Inside the ruins of houses he found dry wood and built a fire. He warmed himself and when rested he removed his netting and went to the lake. As he stepped into the shallows it surprised him how warm the waters were. He took off his mocassins and pulled up his leggings and went deeper. It was warm. He netted half a dozen and took them back to his campsite. He cooked the fish over the fire and ate them all. They were the best fish he ever tasted. Meaty and full of flavor. He lay down and watched the sun go down over summit ridge. Then he fell asleep.
  In the morning he removed his clothes and laid them in the sun to completely dry out. Though the air was cold the waters of the lake were warm. He swam into the deep and washed himself. The fish nipped at his feet harmlessly. He floated in the lake for hours and felt the sunshine on his face and watched the clouds go by. He breathed deeply in and at each exhale he felt the calmness expand. 
  As he floated on the surface his mind drifted. At first his thoughts were of the journey, his mistakes and failures, the things he had learned and would never do again. Then he thought of home and the good things and the bad there. He thought of all that was possible in his future. The many paths things could take. But then his thoughts turned to the impossible. Why he could not say, he let them come. He imagined a world where people walked on clouds and gazed up to the earth to see the trees growing down. He imagined stepping on a cloud. Then suddenly he laughed. It was a laughter free of worry and full of joy, and his heart lifted. “It could be so,” he smiled at the thought of a world such as that, "It could be."
  
  He came to the tree and lifted off the cover from the bucket and gently poured its contents into the ground at the trunk. The dry earth soaked up the water and was gone again. Then he set the bucket on the ground and stood by and he waited.
  Only then did he notice how quiet the village was. He looked around and saw light flickering in the windows and smoke rising from the rooftops, but no one out on their porches. No one walking the paths or fetching water from the well. He left the tree and walked through the center of the village, noting the quiet. The wind blew through the bare trees. His feet rustled through the dried leaves at his feet. But there was no other noise. No activity.
  At the storehouse where they kept their common food supply there were two guards posted. The guards faced straight ahead and would not acknowledge his presence. Their faces were painted red and they held small shields and spears at their side.
  Across from the storehouse was a building where all the materials to make tools were kept. Outside there were dozens of bows leaned against the wall. Next to them were bundles of arrow shafts, bound in twine and on a table were baskets full of arrowheads and raw flint shards. He saw tomahawks and spears laid on the ground. He saw blowguns and darts with feathers.
  He kept walking and came to the western side of the village where the farming plots were tended. They had been barren since the blight. But now he saw in the dim twilight rows of platforms, raised high off the ground. His heartbeat quickened.
  Upon them lay his fellow hunters, his friends and elders both.  There were dozens of them, either scalped otherwise mortally wounded. Under the platforms their families had placed their belongings along with flowers and tokens of rememberance. He recognized those whom he had memories of. Those he had hunted with, laughed with, argued with. All dead now. Their faces like stone under the moonlight.  
  “You must come with us,” a loud voice came from behind. He jerked around and saw two guards standing there. On their belts were tomahawks. Their faces were also painted for war.
  “Where are we going?”
  “To see the chief of war. He has heard of your return and will hold council with you.”
  They moved apart and indicated that he should walk ahead of them. He did so without resistance. Mika went slowly down the path towards the townhouse. As they walked he looked into the windows of the houses and now saw faces in them, watching them from afar in suspicion. When they arrived at the steps leading up the mound to the townhouse he saw the totem which all his life had been painted white was now red. At the entrance the two guards moved in front of him and parted the cover on the door. He entered alone.
  Inside was an open area. Hung on the walls were skin and fur tapestries, decorated with feats from previous chiefs. Green soapstone carvings, used for religious purposes, sat on tables in the far corner. Near the door were more instruments of war, shields and spears lining the walls. Bows and tomahawks lay on the floor. It was the abode of leaders and not a home.
  In the middle of the open area there was a small firepit. The flames and smoke rose through the hole in the ceiling. He saw Yaholo standing nearby and though they met eyes the medicine man did not acknowledge him with any kinship. Sitting cross-legged next to the fire he saw the chief of war, his solemn face painted red and black. It was Tye.
  He gestured for Mika to sit with him. He did so. Tye did not speak to him. He only looked. His eyes widened when he saw how frail and thin his old friend had become. Then after some time, when they were both mesmerized by the flickering of the flames, he did speak.
  “As we hunted in the next valley we slowly exhausted the game in one place. Therefore we sent out scouts to find other game. They led us deeper into the valley to the places they had seen deer and turkey and geese. They also scouted for wild vegetables and found plenty for us to gather. All untouched by the blight. We were pleased things were going so well. We were content.”
  “Soon we learned we were not alone in the valley. There was another tribe. Our scouts spotted their campfires on their journeys and reported the information back to us. The elder hunters held council and thought it best to pay our respects to them, to show our good will and that we wished them no harm. We sent a diplomat, the man named Salal, with baskets of dried meat, soft deerskin blankets, jewelry and wampum. He set off into their territory with the travois of gifts.”
  “One week later our scout Turkeyfoot was out exploring and found the same travois with no gifts but instead the head of Salal.”
  Tye drifted away for a moment, but then refocused and continued.
  “This we would not tolerate. All of us became enraged and wanted blood for this act of violence against one of our own. Salal had gone to them in peace. He did not deserve to die.”
  “Kulsathee and the elders were informed of the news. The chief of peace was not prepared for this turn. He told us to return to the hunt and to avoid the other tribe. Perhaps they would ignore us if we do not try to initiate any further contact. Though we disagreed with this strategy we honored our chief and did as he said.”
  “We returned to the hunt. Our quota was increased because we had missed so many days. This late in the year we had no time to lose. Ever kill matters.”
  “There was a night. It was not long ago and yet it feels as an eternity has passed since the terror of that night. Our camp bedded down one evening. It had been a good day. It was a clear night and the moon was full. That is to say it was not utterly dark. Even so, warriors from the other tribe crept past our lookouts. A dozen of them ambushed the camp while we all slept. They were savvy. They went after the elder hunstment first of all by bashing their heads in with stones. As the noises woke us there was screaming and confused shouting.”
  “After the elders they came after the young hunters and yet by that time we had been able to gather weapons to defend ourselves. We fought and killed several of them. I myself killed two. But we lost many of our own. Thankfully our women remained unharmed, though certainly they would have also been slaughtered.”
  “When the invaders realized they were outnumbered and had lost their advantage they fled back into the forest. Our scouts tracked them but they know that land better than we, so we lost them.”
  “That same night we prepared the dead and journeyed back to the village, with heavy hearts. When the people saw what happened to their loved ones they wailed. Then there was panic. The people demanded to Kulsathee and the elders that we retaliate for this atrocity. Otherwise, they argued, we could not hunt in safety and therefore would not be able to store food enough to survive the winter.”
  “The chief of peace was not prepared to make that kind of decision. The elders held a council and decided that it was better in such a time to appoint a chief of war. Kulsathee agreed. Since we had lost so many elder hunters and since I had shown great bravery in the ambush I was chosen. The other hunters were made warriors. There was a ceremony. Yaholo performed the rites.”
  “After we held council and made the decision to keep the village gates closes at all times and for guards to be posted at every entrance, along with the lookouts. We set a curfew for everyone. Not to leave their homes after sunset. We set up a ration program to better control the distribution of our food supply. We must be cautious.”
  Here Tye stopped. His eyes were fixed on the flames. Mika said nothing but looked at the chief of war with compassion. Then Tye looked intently at Mika.
  “Help us. Help your people. I know you have gone another way, but leave that and join us. Nothing will come of that. I command you to fight for your tribe. Abandon your quest and help the people who need you most.”
  Mika looked at him but did not answer. Tye watched him.
  “Quickly the others have forgotten who you are. They call you the boy with the bucket and mock you. And truly you are weak and not the same as you were before. But I remember your ability in the hunt. I do not forget so quickly as the others. None was better with the bow among our people. None. So regain your strength and sharpen your skills. Then fight with us. We can defeat them together. Side by side. Just like we used to hunt deer in the valley. Soon we will return there to take our revenge and to claim our stake. Help us, Mika. This I command as your chief.”
  They both stood and stared at one another for a long time, but Mika did not speak. Then the chief of war nodded to the guard posted at the door. He went outside.
  “Yaholo told me this would be your answer but I did not want to believe it. I thought you would understand. Nothing will come of your path. You will regret your the choice you made to turn your back on your tribe. Understand you are no longer welcome in our village. Understand you must leave through the gates and not return again. Understand it was you who abandoned us.”
  Three guards from outside entered the townhouse and took Mika by the arms. They led him out while he fixed his gaze on Tye. The face of the chief of war was stonelike and impassive but before they were out the door he addressed him.
  “Once you were my good friend.”
  The guards escorted Mika to the southern gates. The lookouts opened them and they carried him well outside and shoved him to the ground. The empty bucket fell from his hand and rolled on its side. Then the guards returned inside the gates and they were closed. He was alone.
  He went to the wilds and set camp in a clearing. He lay down and faced the palisaded walls of his village, far in the distance, the gates lit by torches and the lookouts staring straight ahead. The night was clear and the moon was out. He was weak and hungry. He had not eaten since his return to the valley. He had no food. It hurt him to look at the village so he shut his eyes and dreamed he was at the lake in the mountain, swimming in its waters among a multitude of fish.


  In the morning there was a frost on the ground. It covered the blanket he had pulled over his head to keep out the bitter cold in the night. Frost covered the grass in the clearing. It covered the limbs of the trees in the forest. He awoke shivering. His breaths came out in rising plumes. Braving the sting of the frigid air he collected kindling and fuel wood and with trembling hands built a fire. When it was going he sat as near to it as he could, letting the heat thaw his bones. He looked at towards the village, obscured in a light fog. He could not stay in the wilds. There was nothing for him here. There was no food. He felt his stomach and traced the lines of his rib cage with his fingers. But he had no strength to walk the path again. He was hungry and weak. He was very weak.
  Out of the fog a dark figure emerged, covered in robes, and walked towards the clearing. A hand emerged from the fur sleeve and set a bowl of meat in front of him. He took up the bowl and greedily ate the contents. When he was finished he licked the grease from his fingers.
  “There is more I can bring you.”
  “No, mama.”
  She removed the hood and regarded her son. She saw how frail he had become. His eyes bulged from deep sockets and his cheekbones protruded from his thinness. Dirt and grime from miles of walking the path covered his face and body. His hair, once smooth and shiny, was now matted and torn, with bare patches in places where clumps of it had fallen out, a toll of the hunger.
  Ama looked around the clearing, the rising sun melting away the frost. She began to cry. Mika reached out to comfort her. At his touch she pulled him close and held him against her. She ran her fingers through his hair and said things to soothe his heart, words of tenderness. It had been so long since any kindness had been spoken to him that the gentle sound of her voice alone broke his heart.
  “I miss you, mama. I miss my friends. I miss how life was before. Those days will never come again, that is for sure. Tell me the truth, mama, will they come again?”
  “Yes,” she told him, “Those days will come again. Do not lose hope in that. Do not fall into despair.”
  There was a time they did not speak and only held one another. Both were remembering times from long ago. The smell of her brought back memories he had kept since he was a child. There was a day in spring when he and his mother and father went to the ceremonial grounds and lay together on a blanket under the shade of the tree all day long, for no reason at all, except to be together and to enjoy the gift of the day.
  Soon the fire had burned down and he rose and gathered more kindling from the forest. When it had going again they both sat together, embraced and staring into the flames.
  “They are right to exile me. I do not blame them. I have been selfish to abandon the tribe during the blight. And for what? To honor the memory of my father who is no longer even alive. I have chosen to honor the dead and not the living, and what good has come of that? Nothing at all. I am worse than all of them.”
  “Do not say such things. You have been strong. You have been brave. Your heart is pure.”
  “Please do not use such words to describe me. It hurts me because I know they are untrue. How hungry I am, mama. Every night I dream of meat roasting on the fire. I dream of kanuchi soup and bean and corn bread and bowls of dried peaches. But even more than hungry I am lonely. I am so lonely. Do you now see why I am worse than them? They know what they live for. I do not care anymore. I do not care about the mountain or the lake or the tree. What does that make me? Look at what I have become. Look at my arms and legs. Look how weak. I am no hunter anymore. I am no warrior. To walk the path is all I am good for, and yet I have no will to carry on with that. So what good am I? In the wilds is where I belong. This is my home now.”
  He pointed to the village, where there were many plumes of chimney smoke rising from the outer walls.”
  “Look at what they have. Homes and families and neighbors. They have firepits and stores of food. They lift their spirits with kindness and make each other laugh. When the nights are cold they hold their women close to them. Do you want to know a secret? I crave those things too. My heart is not pure. I am not brave or strong. I envy them. They are right to ridicule me. The boy with the bucket, how pathetic. In the wilds is my true home.”
  When he had finished he grew silent and they sat together and did not speak again for some time. 
  “Mama?”
  “Yes?”
  “The paths do not make a circle.”
  “No,” she admitted.
  Ama comforted him until it was late. Then she rose to return to the village. The thing that had been asked of him had not been asked of her and therefore he knew she could not stay with him out here. Nor did he want her to. He felt a strong desire for her to be happy, to comfort her and to ease her suffering. At last he understood it was a blessing to be able to do for others. Not a burden as so many thought. As a child he had not known this, but he was no longer a child and he knew.
  His mother visited him in the wilds every day. She brought him food and sat with him and listened to him unburden his heart. Then in the evenings she went inside the village walls. She promised him no matter what, whether he was here or gone out there, she would visit each day. One morning late in fall, he rose with the sun and packed up his things. He put on his furs and slung the satchel over his shoulder. He sheathed his knife and bound his shoes for travel. Then he followed the river. The bucket was empty and therefore light to carry.
  
  Full of water the handle of the bucket dug into the callouses on his hands and made them raw. He switched hands at regular intervals. Yet he was near the clearing in the wilds that was his home now. Close to the village, where he could rest. The first signs of winter had appeared on the prairie where the grass had yellowed and the river on mornings crusted over with thin sheets of ice. In the valley the trees were bare and dry leaves blanketed the ground so that his feet shuffled through them. He built fires at night and slept as near to them as he could stand, and yet by morning there was inevitably frost on any part of him not heated by embers. He often woke numb at the fingers and toes.
  As he rounded the last bend in the river his heart swelled as it always did when he began to recognize the landmarks of home, the rotted treestump, the pattern of lichen growing on the rock formation on the hill, the footprints in the mud he had made himself on previous journeys. His heart swelled until he was able to see the wooden palisades, which were now charred and broken to pieces. He hobbled towards the village as fast as his weakened legs would carry him. As the exent of the destruction came into view his heart fell.
  The gates lay flat on the ground, shattered. There were no lookouts. But he saw a dead body, hidden in the rubble where the archer platform used to be. He looked to have been dead for a week, scalped around the temple, his face contorted in a scream that would never stop.
  He stepped across the ruins at the gate and entered the village. The remains of homes lay scattered over the pathways, charred planks, doorways, porches, furniture, all laid to waste, exposed to the morning air. It felt obscene and made him sick to his stomach. He hurried past it all to the home of his aunt, to find his mother.
  Their home was still standing. Ayita and her family lay inside on the floor. They were weakened from hunger, faces haggard and pale. Ama was not among them. He addressed his aunt.
  “Where is my mother?”
  “Give us something to eat.”
  “Ayita, what happened here? Is my mother okay?”
  “There is so little left. Why did you come back? There is nothing for you here anymore.”
  “Where is she? Tell me.”
  He prepared himself to hear the worst but Ayita only sneered.
  “She is with them, at the place we used to grow crops. Tending to the lucky dead. The blight took all and they took the rest. We were so proud of our plans. So practical and certain. Now we will starve. All will die. We are the unlucky dead, because our end will be painful and slow. If you have no food leave us alone. Go away. There is nothing for you here.”
  Ayita turned away from him and would not say anything else. He looked at her family and saw the children lying still, their bodies weak from hunger. He left them and went to the western part of the village where the crops were grown.
  As he approached he saw dark plumes of smoke rising and then a large bonfire, though he dared not look at what burned. He saw people there doing work, collecting debris and the bodies of the dead. There were bodies lying on the patches of soil, dozens of them, most he recognized, men and women and children. He felt a darkness spread inside him, a hollow feeling of dread. He looked for his mother and then spotted her with some others. He went to her and when she saw him it took some time for her recognize him. When she did her eyes grew sad.
  “Why did you come back?”
  “Mama.”
  “I prayed that you would stay out there. I prayed that you would not come back. I prayed for that.”
  He did not see any light in her eyes. There was only a mechanical will to survive. No hope. He looked at the others and saw the same lightlessness in their eyes as they went about their work. Then he remembered where he had seen those eyes before. Then he hated them without knowing why. Those stupid black eyes, watching all. Pecking in the dirt for survival and for survival only. And nothing more.
  He took his mother by the arms and held her close to him. As the heat passed between them she looked up and there was the light. It had returned at least for now. She regarded him with tears and kissed him.
  “We have no food. They came. They killed whoever stood in their path. They took it all. Now we have to bury them. They cannot remain exposed. There are others on the eastern side of the village. Do not go there, Mika, whatever you do. They are those who have truly lost hope. They take the bodies of the dead. They take them and,”
  His mother broke off and wept into her hands.
  “Life has become horrible, Mika. You should not have come back. You were right to go. You should have stayed out there.”
  She left him and continued her work of wrapping the bodies, anointing them, and carrying them off to the bonfire. He walked among the dead, remembering the life that used to be in them, now silent and still. A few rows away he saw Leoti kneeling over the body of Mohe, her beloved. Her face was one of utter loss and bewilderment. She clapsed her hands together in prayer. Her eyes were reddened with tears.
  In the sky there was a glow beyond the overcast, the rays of the sun not able to shine through the gloom. A wind blew through the pathways and whipped up leaves and ashes into tiny whirlwinds. He looked at everything and then continued into the village center.
  The townhouse stood. Its roof had caved in and two walls were collapsed into rubble. The porch overhang was gone. Everything was charred or singed. From this distance he could through the broken walls to the inside. There was smoke rising from a fire. He walked up the mound and stepped through the doorway. No guards were posted. No medicine man. But the chief of war was there. His face was no longer painted. The entire left side of his face was scarred with blisters and there was a sunken pit where the left eye used to be. He sat near the fire and stared into the flames.
  When Mika entered he glanced up but did not acknowledge him and then returned to the fire. He sat on the other side. A long time passed before Tye spoke to him.
  “All our plans, all our preparations, meant nothing in the end. We gathered our warriors. We gathered our bows, spears, and tomahawks. Then we entered the valley to prove to them we would not cower from their aggression. We would not run in fear. We tracked their movements and made our ambush in the night, fierce and quick. We took many scalps on that day, and lost few. Pleased with our success we established a new basecamp and resumed the hunt.”
  “We heard nothing from them after and therefore assumed the best, that we had frightened them away and had claimed our stake to hunt in this valley. We returned to the village with the spoils of that victorious campaign and celebrated with family and friends long into the night. But it was in those early morning hours, after the fires had burned down, after we were stuffed with food and drink, that they made their attack.”
  “They tracked us, you see. All without our knowledge. We naive and proud of ourselves. They followed us here and crouched hidden in the forests. There were dozens of them, prepared not for ambush, but for annihilation. Out of the darkness they came, heaving bombs of oil and fire. They burned down the gates. They burned everything. Without mercy they slaughtered our families, our children. None were spared. By the time we had collected and prepared to fight back they had flooded the entire village. The burning homes illuminated the faces of our attackers. We saw them enraged, their faces painted black all over.”
  “We fought back but it was no good. There were too many of them and we were not prepared. We retreated into the center of the village and defended what remained of our buildings and who remained of our families. The violence lasted until sunrise. Only then did we realize it was not their plan to kill us all. They had taken our supplies and our stores of meat. Now we know  they too had encountered the blight. For their survival they carried off everything we had and cruelly left us to starve.”
  “Once it was discovered the food stores were gone, those who survived lost hope. The elders lost hope. I lost hope. What else can we do? Our tribe will starve. We will not survive the winter. All our plans meant nothing in the end.”
  Mika looked at his old friend but he would not face him, only into the flames.
  “Where are the elders now? Where is Kulsathee?”
  Tye smiled without joy. There was no light in his eyes. No hint of hope in his voice.
  “You should not have come back, Mika. You should have stayed out there.”
  He returned to the flames and would speak no more.
  Mika left the townhouse and walked into the center square. To the east he saw where his mother had told him to stay away. There were houses in ruin. People crawled over the debris. Their clothes were burned and torn. Their hair was matted with ash and dirt. He watched them scurry among the desolation, hunting for food or for anything of value to be traded for the scraps that remained. There were bloodstains on their hands and around their mouths. They were those who had truly lost all hope. They saw him looking and turned away, ashamed of what they had become.
  He entered the ceremonial grounds and whatever hope remained in his heart went out of him. He dropped the bucket to the ground and fell to his knees under the tree. It was destroyed. Its bark charred and burned. Its branches broken. Its trunk torn asunder, exposing the pale wood inside. Around the tree the skies vanished and the earth crumbled away and revealed to him the infinite dark. 
  Always he had known this was the true way of things. His whole life had been a vain attempt to keep this knowledge out of mind and he had prayed in the deepest, most secret part of him that he would never have to face it. But now it was here and even if he shut his eyes and reopened them, it was still here. He curled into himself and wept into the abyss. The burden of his struggle went out of him, any love he still held in his heart went out of him and seeped into that infinite dark until all was darkness and all that remained was the silence of the darkness. And yet,
  Somewhere a voice cried out in the lonely depths of space and time. Somewhere it cried out and he listened and he heard the words spoken.

  *Do what I ask of you*

  Snow fell on the prairie. Storm clouds blew over the plains, darkening the skies midday. A single flake fell onto the ground. Then another. Then more. By afternoon it was white to the horizon. It blanketed the ground and flurried in the air. He stopped to camp for the evening and gathered wood from a cotton tree and built a fire. The snow fell onto the flames and evaporated into motes of steam. He unraveled the large skin from his satchel and made a tent. He netted a fish from the river and cooked it and then he went to sleep.
  By morning the snow had nearly enclosed him. He brushed it away and crawled out to survey the campsite. The fire had burned down and was covered. The top of the river had frozen in the night, though water still flowed under the clear ice. He uncovered the bucket from a mound of snow. His hands were numb and red from the cold. He wrapped them with skins and also covered his face, leaving only the eyes exposed. Then he set off to mountain, stomping through the soft powder.
  He heard thunder and saw flashes of lighting beyond the white haze ahead of him. Then the snow fell in slanting sheets, mixed with ice. The wind drove hard against him. If he eased up for even a second the force of it would blow him backwards. The haze in the air grew thick until it was impossible to tell where it ended and the ground began. To find his way he prodded for the river ice with a long stick.
  But soon he grew tired. He stopped at the bottom of a hill, under an overhang that gave him some protection from the blizzard. He was able to find enough wood to make a small fire but it was too cold and he was too blind to break the ice and try to catch a fish. So he went to bed hungry and very tired.
  The storm continued for days in ebbs and flows. He made good progress whenever it slacked and he could see the mountain again. Other days he stayed hunkered inside the tent and waited for it to pass.
  Then one morning he crawled out and saw blue in the skies and rejoiced. The sun was bright and the plains of snow blinded him. The snow was three feet deep in places and made his progress slow. 
  The river had been completely covered by the storms so that he could no longer even see the banks. Though he knew it was there, somehwere, all he could see was a sheet of white to the horizon. But he found he no longer needed it to guide him. He recognized the contours of the land. As he entered the foothills, every slope and hill and every escarpment on the mountain was like a guidepost to him. So he used those and found his way.
  It was hard going as the elevation rose. Because the river was covered and frozen through by this point he could no longer catch fish to eat. He no longer felt the hunger itself but he did feel the weakness and the dizziness. So he rested more often and set camp earlier. He slept longer and rose later.
  Still he made progress. Each day brought him nearer to the summit. He entered the highlands and was glad to see the snow was not as deep here. Also here he was able to find plenty of dry crooks and overhangs where the ground was dry. Here he was able to find wood to build a fire at night. He continued up the mountain and reached the place where the river went underground. Then he passed the narrow canyon and arrived at the long climb of stairs which led to the passage.
  At this altitude the wind was bitter cold. When it blew it was like being sliced with a knife. He wrapped himself with the remaining furs and skins and started up the steps, feeling his way with the long stick. On the very first step his foot slipped and he fell hard onto his side. The rocks bruised him. In his weakened state it took a few minutes to get back onto his feet. He felt around the steps and saw they were covered by a thin, almost invisible layer of ice. He looked upwards at the thousands of steps he must ascend and sighed deeply.
  He sat down on the bucket and pulled the knife from its sheath and whittled the end of the walking stick to a point. Then he tested it on the bottom step. With enough force he was able to break the ice to make it walkable. This is how he ascended, step by step, towards the summit. To break the ice made the going slow, but to slip on ice at this height would be certain death. His arms grew tired so he had to stop often to rest. His breathing was rapid and shallow. A few times he had to stop from dizziness, whenever he put too much strength into it and saw stars at the corner of his eyes.
  It was nightfall when he emerged from the passage and saw the lake rippling in the wind, its colors muted in the twilight. He found a place in the ruins with a roof intact and made his camp there. He collected wood and build a fire and went to sleep as soon as his eyes shut.
  In the morning he went to the lake and netted a few fish. His joints were sore and he found it very hard to focus on the task. He gutted and skewered the fish and then roasted them over the fire. After the first bite he felt his energy return, a spread of warmth from the inside out. He ate all the fish and then lay beside the fire. He fell asleep again and woke up the afternoon. Then he removed his furs and walked barefoot into the lake. The water was warm and soothed his muscles and joints. He was too weak to swim but it was enough to just float, his feet lifting off the bottom. He scrubbed the dirt and grime from his body and washed his matted hair. When it was evening he caught a few more fish and cooked them over the fire and went to sleep.
  He repeated the same routine in the days that followed. Slowly his strength returned and his mind became clearer. The weather remained cold and overcast but there were no more snowstorms. He cleaned out the debris from the ruins that had made his home. He walked around the entire circumference of the lake gathering wood and by the end of the third day the woodpile was six feet tall. Using bark from the wood he gathered he tied it together with some twine and fixed it to a long stick and made a torch. With the illumination he walked through the passage and discovered rooms and corridors that seemed to go on for miles into the mountain. He studied the petroglyphs on the walls, but it would take years to decipher all the stories they told, perhaps decades.
  Late one afternoon he sat on the beach watching the sun go down over the summit cliffs and glisten on the lake waters. He saw the fish underneath the surface, swimming in schools. To live here would be a good life. For shelter he had the ruins. With those raw materials he could build a house. For food and water he had the lake. He knew the lake would never stop providing for him. He could spend his days exploring the depths of the mountain passages and slowly unravel the mysteries of the petroglyphs. That would be a good life.

  With his free hand he stabbed the ice on the step below and cracked it enough to give him a solid foothold. In the other he carried the bucket, full of water, covered with the lid and sealed with twine. It took him twice the time to descend the stairway down the summit than it did to ascend, nearly an entire day. He had to stop for rest often and switched hands every fifteen steps. 
  When he reached the broad lip halfway down he decided to take a nap. He wrapped into his furs and nestled into the most comfortable spot he could find. He saw the vista which stretched to the far horizon. All was a wasteland, dead and barren. The rivers had turned to ice and the soil had frozen and was covered by drifts of snow. The trees no longer had leaves, their wood dry and theirs limbs wavering in the frozen wind. Crops were dead, their stalks blighted and brown. In the valley the animals dead and the people starving. Tears welled in his eyes as he witnessed the endless spread of the desolation. *Beautiful world*, he thought.
  He made it to the bottom safely and camped that night overlooking the vista. In his satchel he carried as many roasted fish as he could, knowing they would only last a day or two before going bad. But he needed all the energy he could, as the river was frozen and would no longer provide him food to eat. He walked all day long and tried to ignore the cold. 
  By the time he reached the foothills his food had long run out and he had to rest often. He sat upon the bucket and his mind drifted and sometimes he forgot how long he had been there. He was afraid of the daylight slipping away and got back on the path. One good thing that came from the freezing temperature was that the surface of the snow iced over and made the walking easier than before, when it was a fine powder. In some places the drifts were not too deep and he poked his walking stick where he thought the river was and tried to crack the surface. He would give anything for a fish to eat. He was very hungry.
  On the prairie the cold began to penetrate through the material of his traveling mocassins. They had worn so thin from the miles the cold began to freeze his toes. Then they were numb and he could no longer feel them. One night at camp he opened the bucket and was surprised to find the water unfrozen, and still warm. He removed his shoes and soaked them in the water. The ends of his toes were brusied and blackened and the water soothed them. He rested for a few days when he found a cottonwood tree with plenty of wood to harvest. He built a fire and soaked his feet and rested his muscles and joints. He was so weary that he slept for almost an entire day. He was very tired.
  From the hunger his mind became delirious. He knew it would be that way and repeated the words to remind himself to keep focus, “I am on the path.” But his mind drifted and he thought about food and of home, things he had promised himself he would not think about, because they only distracted him from the simple act of placing one foot in front of the other. His thoughts drifted to his first days out here, so long ago, a thousand years ago. The grass of the prairie stretched before him and the peacefulness of the landscape entered into him. That was how it was then and it was that way now as he looked across the snowy plains. To place one foot in front of the other. To carry the bucket. To walk. That was all that mattered and all that had ever mattered. His mind drifted and he caught himself and repeated the phrase and continued. Then sun went down and he camped and rose again and set off on the path. The hunger grew and his weariness grew and his mind was not able to stay focused on his footsteps and the landmarks on the horizon. His mind grew delirious and drifted and he tried to keep focused on the path. But sometimes he could not help it and his mind would drift and he would imagine himself walking from above, like a bird above. From a great height he could see himself walking, a boy with a bucket across the vast plains walking. Ever walking.
  
  It was morning. The snow had covered the burned grass and rubble and lay in drifts against the sides of the homes. When the sun had just risen to shine through the windows of the house, Ama was awoken by the sound of drums. She rose weakly from her blanket on the floor and saw her nieces peering outside, they too thin and frail. There was shouting in the direction of the drumbeat, frantic shouting, and then they saw other families walking past. Ayita and her husband emerged from the next room with fearful eyes. They went out towards the center of the village, where the sounds were coming from.
  Once outside they could better hear the cries. Their pace quickened. Others came out their homes, grim and red in their eyes, and followed behind the group. Soon there was a crowd of them walking together. Yet that crowd was small in comparison to the one that had gathered in the ceremonial grounds.
  Ama saw them all and her heart went out and her eyes welled with tears. She knew why the drums were beating and why they had gathered under the tree. Somehow she knew. As they hurried her tears ran down her cheeks onto the frosted ground. There the villagers stood together, their backs to them. She pushed through the crowds until reaching the center. The people here kneeled and then she saw him. She ran past their bowed heads and cradled his body in her arms, his bony limbs frostbitten, his clothes worn and tattered, his eyes closed. The bucket lay empty on the ground. She cradled him and brushed back the hair from his face and kissed his forehead gently. She sobbed.
  Around her she recognized those who kneeled before the body of her son. She saw Kulsathee and the elders. Yaholo and his apprentices. She saw Tye, the chief of war, who held out two interlocking fingers. She saw Leoti weeping, her hands clasped together. At her side was Ayita and her daughters. Yona the youngest pulled at her mother’s dress.
 “It’s strange, mama,” she said, pointing, “It’s strange in winter for the fruit to grow.”
 Ama saw that their tears were not tears of sorrow but of happiness. They were tears of joy. And their eyes were not on Mika her son but on the tree. Her eyes lifted and she saw its trunk, which had been burnt and charred, was new again, its bark the rich color of fetile soil. Its limbs, which had been broken and burned, were like they had been before, but not quite, because now leaves had sprouted there. Transclucent green, the color of spring, so full and delicate they fluttered softly in the winter wind. And on those limbs fruit. Round and yellow, bursting from pale flowers on the limbs of the tree. They fell from the branches with a heavy thud onto the icy ground and cracked open, spilling out the fleshy innards, warm and orange-red in color. Where each fruit fell a baby fruit sprouted in its place and grew fat in no time at all.
  The villagers brought baskets and gathered the fallen fruit. Under the canopy of the tree the snow and ice melted into water which soaked into the earth and was gone forever. On their faces was awe and any trace of skepticism vanished when they bit into the fruit for the first time. Their eyes grew bright and they smiled as they collected as much as they could carry.
  She held her son in the midst of it all. She listened to them speak of him in hushed and solemn tones. “Truly he was the son of Sakima,” some said, “Truly he was the son of his father.” Then she knew he would always be remembered, honored in the songs and stories of their people, from this day forward. That was good and she was happy for it, but all she really wanted was to once more see the light in his eyes and to tell him how much she loved him.
  [MIKA DOES NOT DIE]
  Kulsathee, the old chief of peace, rose to his feet and stood underneath the canopy of the tree. There he faced the people gathered around. He looked at them with kind and tearful eyes and tried to express in words the new glimmer of hope he perceived in all their faces and in all their hearts. But no words came to him so he rejoined his family. They turned to the children now sat around the base of the tree, where tender shoots of grass were coming up through the frozen ground. The young ones were laughing together, oblivious that anyone was watching, as they ate of that sweet and mysterious fruit.
