She caressed his fingers as they wove through a maze of round tables to the back of the place where they gave the private dances. They found an empty cubicle and she led him inside and pulled the black curtain and then faced him and their eyes met. He was seated against the wall in the only chair, his knees parted, too stiff and business-like, she thought. Brazenly he raised a crisp twenty dollar bill stuck between two fingers.

"Angel baby."
"Your hot as fuck girl, you know that? Your my favorite one. Got them child-bearin hips dontcha?"
"Your sweet."

What she had expected would happen all this night when she thought about it. Then it did happen. At last. If it were possible she would have gone even lower, through the floor and into the ground beneath. Instead she drew a sharp breath. Then exhaled. And again. Her entire body prostrate now. Tears.

She was a butterfly. Her soul felt tender and delicate. She was a piece of sashimi. A breeze through an open window would carry her away. She was thin ice at the edge of a pond. She was a love song overheard in a dream and now nearly forgotten.
