A short novel about a young woman who gets her shit together.

1) The Prayer - where she has a physical need to get low to the ground
2) The Friend - where she is a dandelion in a thunderstorm, speaks with a friend who does not understand and gets sucked back in temporarily, at a sushi bar

Chapters should be short, concise, each one moving her story forward definitively in some way. Somewhere seed the fact she has children, one alive, one dead.
