The eaters of the fetus try to recreate it, mechanical, dead, mundane
work.

He triumps over them by yielding to their violence.

The story diverges at a single point, either resenting the fetus and trying to recreate the fetus by machine, or embracing the loss, descending and becoming a fetus

The creatures appear transclucent though this is because his eyes can see through their flesh, like x-rays, rather 
than because their skin had that characteristic.

A parable about a man who finds himself lost in a forest where the trees 
are barren and the ground is covered in leaves. The man is unable to remember his 
name or where he's from. He can't event remember long he has been walking. He 
discovers a strange fetus floating in a milky pond. In the surrounding forest 
there are creatures who want to harm the fetus and he protects it from them.

An enormous sun that overtakes the sky and burns away the leaves.

A blue nebula, with tentacles spread across the black firmament. Something so far from him, light years away. Something alluring. If wings sprouted from his back one day he would fly to it.

The creatures black, hardened. Later learn they were burned by the sun.

After he nutures the fetus and it departs, he can either stumble in sadness and clean 
himself in the milky waters, sinking in and discovering a world below the surface, where 
he loses his body and floats the surface as a fetus himself, nourished by the waters and a 
tendril from some depths.

Or, he can grow bitter and angry and resent the fetus for leaving him, burned further, and 
join in with others who attack other fetuses, and those who want to protect them.

If you join the creatures you learn they hide (in some weird way) during the sunrise, this 
implies that at one time they too protected fetuses, being exposed, and somehow turned.

In the milk he joins with another being, a scene of making love, becomes the fetus.

You call the things you see all around you trees, and rocks, and grass, and leaves, but not 
because they are really those things, but because that is how your mind is able to make sense of them. 
Your memory of those things creates the association, since they have the nearest relationship through 
both form and behavior. But then sometimes the thing you call a tree will bend down consciously 
and sniff around and the illusion is broken. But you can't help yourself. It's how the mind works.
